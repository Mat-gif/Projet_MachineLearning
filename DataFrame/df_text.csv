0,"(CNN) Even though the coronavirus pandemic continues to take lives across the United States, Covid-19 has not become the leading cause of death in the nation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed to CNN. ""There are no data to support that theory,"" Jeff Lancashire, a spokesperson for the National Center for Health Statistics, said in an email on Friday. False claims declaring that coronavirus has become the leading cause of death in the US have swirled as the US leads the world in coronavirus cases . Those claims are made by some experts comparing how many people die of coronavirus daily with the estimate of how many people may die daily on average of each leading cause of death, using CDC data. In other words -- the claims involve comparing reported deaths from Covid-19 to estimated deaths for leading causes of deaths, which include heart disease and cancer. Read More",true/false
1,"As we try to come to terms with the extent of Chinese influence over the Biden family, a leaked database of registered members of the Chinese Communist Party has exposed a mass infiltration of American companies — with serious national security implications.  Boeing, Qualcomm and Pfizer are just three US companies that have employed dozens of CCP members in their Chinese facilities, the database reveals.  As well, three female employees of the US consulate in Shanghai have been identified in the list of 1.95 million party members that was leaked to an international group of legislators, the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, which includes Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Bob Menendez (D-NJ).  All CCP members swear an oath to “fight for communism throughout my life, be ready at all times to sacrifice my all for the party and the people, and never betray the party [and] guard party secrets, be loyal to the party.”  Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), a member of the Homeland Security Committee, said yesterday: “CCP agents have no place in US government facilities, and this report should serve as a much-needed wake-up call to Washington, DC, and corporate executives, who continue to welcome the Chinese government with open arms.  “[It] is just more evidence of the extent to which the CCP has successfully infiltrated American companies and government.”  While none of the people listed in the database have been identified as spies, mounting concerns in the State Department about the CCP have resulted in tightened visa rules for its members earlier this month. CCP members and their immediate families now are limited to one-month, single-entry US permits.  The database was verified by international cybersecurity firm Internet 2.0, which found it was originally leaked on encrypted messaging app Telegram in 2016. It was passed on to IPAC six weeks ago by a third party.  “We have high confidence this list is authentic,” Internet 2.0 co-founder David Robinson, a former Australian army intelligence officer, told me Sunday.  “Someone — an insider, a dissident — managed to get physical access to the server [in Shanghai] from outside the building. They didn’t have to hack it over the internet.”  Each data entry contains the CCP member’s name, ethnicity, place of birth, education level, identification number and, in some cases, a phone number and address.  Robinson has verified the identity of three women who work at the US consulate in Shanghai.  The three, all listed as ethnic Han college graduates, are registered in a 31-strong Communist Party branch listed as Shanghai Foreign Institutional Service Co., which is a state-owned employment agency, which provides local staff for foreign consulates, schools and news media.  A department spokesperson yesterday had no comment about “an allegedly leaked database of Communist Party members” and said “the department does not discuss security protocols or personnel matters.”  However, she said: “Influence and interference operations are fundamental to how the Chinese Communist Party engages with the world.  “China’s role in the world today cannot be understood without reference to the wide array of malign activities that the [CCP] undertakes to influence our societies in ways that are covert, coercive and corrupting.”  The CCP database is split into 79,000 branches.  For example, Boeing has 17 branches, totaling 252 CCP members. Sixteen members are part of Boeing’s Hongqiao Maintenance Base Boeing Line Maintenance Division . . . First Workshop Party Branch; 22 are in the Second Workshop Party Branch; 13 are in the Third Workshop Party Branch, 14 in the Fourth Workshop Party Branch.  There are four subdivisions of the Pudong Maintenance Base Boeing Line Maintenance Branch, totaling 49 members.  Two branches of the Pudong Maintenance Base Boeing Line Maintenance Branch Cargo Aircraft Line Maintenance total 33 members.  Also listed are 27 members of the Party Branch of Boeing Fourth Branch of the Flight Department of Eastern Airlines Yunnan Co. and 23 members of the China Eastern Airlines Beijing Maintenance Department Party Committee Boeing Maintenance Workshop Party Branch.  Boeing spokesman Bradley Akubuiro said last night the company was satisfied with its security.  “As a global company, we enforce strict security protocols and maintain secure firewalls to protect both our customer and company proprietary data in all countries we operate in.”  According to the database, 96 members in the Qualcomm Wireless Communication Technology (China) Co. Ltd. Party Branch, and 133 additional members spread over six party branches of Qualcomm Enterprise Management (Shanghai) work for semiconductor manufacturer and 5G wireless technology company Qualcomm, a US-based multinational.  Qualcomm was awarded a contract by the Defense Department in 2018 to develop multifactor authentication security systems for US military computers.  Another US company crucial to national security is pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, which began rolling out COVID-19 vaccines Sunday.  The database lists 69 CCP members in four Pfizer branches in Shanghai.  Neither Qualcomm nor Pfizer responded to inquiries yesterday.  New York University also appears with 71 members attached to a branch named East China Normal University Shanghai New York University Faculty and Labor Party Branch.  The database leak comes just days after a number of disturbing revelations involving CCP infiltration of American institutions:  Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe warned that China has targeted members of Congress and poses “the greatest threat to democracy and freedom” since World War II.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned of China’s infiltration of US universities, which are “hooked on Communist cash” and stifle criticism of Beijing.  Media reports identified Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a member of House Intelligence Committee, as one of several San Francisco politicians courted by Chinese spy Christine Fang.  It was confirmed last week that Joe Biden’s son Hunter is under federal investigation over tax fraud and potential money-laundering over his foreign business dealings, including in China.  “Communist China has been allowed to infiltrate our universities and corporations with people loyal to only the Communist Party,” former Acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell said Sunday.  “Our beloved Chinese American community has been warning us about these tactics for many years, and the political class has ignored those warnings.”",true/false
2,"HOUSTON — In Texas, marijuana is illegal, and a Duke University study says using it can make you less smart.  For decades, researchers studied more than 1,000 people in New Zealand. They found teenagers who use marijuana at least four days a week lost 8 IQ points between the ages of 13 and 38.  Here's the key: that same thing didn't happen for people who heavily smoked marijuana only as adults. Heavy pot smokers did show deficits in memory, concentration and just overall brainpower. But all those effects were much worse among those who started lighting up as teens.  So is an 8-point IQ loss significant? Researchers say you bet. A person's long-term job prospects, job performance an income could be impacted, too.  Researchers can't say for certain marijuana is the sole reason those IQs took a hit. A competing study found a person's socioeconomic status could also be to blame for the IQ slide.  RELATED: Could marijuana law reform come to Texas this year?

3,"Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele high-fives supporters as he comes out to make a victory speech at Ugly’s Pub in Milwaukee. Credit: Kyle Bursaw / for the Journal Sentinel By of the Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele defeated state Sen. Chris Larson Tuesday, after spending $4 million of his own money since July and loading broadcast airwaves and mailboxes with messages in recent weeks. Abele, 49, was re-elected to a second full four-year term by a wide margin of 12 percentage points. Abele won 56% of the vote to Larson's 44%, according to incomplete results. Abele had placed a close second behind Larson in the four-way February primary. County Comptroller Scott Manske won re-election to a second four-year term. Manske, the former appointed county controller, was not opposed for the office. Abele supporters chanted ""four more years"" after results were announced during an election watch gathering at Ugly's Pub on Old World Third St. ""So what do I owe you for that?"" he said of the work that secured a second term. ""What I owe you is that we're going to think bigger and aim even higher."" Pointing to his administration's project to eliminate chronic homelessness in the county in the next three years, Abele pledged a similar effort to reduce racial disparities in incarceration, housing, employment and education. ""We're going to put a stake in the ground,"" he said. ""Hold me accountable for it."" Larson, 35, had expected to spend about $210,000 on his campaign — a figure dwarfed by Abele's multimillion-dollar campaign. Larson attempted to counter the large spending imbalance by greeting voters at community events and Friday fish fries. Late Tuesday, Larson thanked supporters at Garfield's 502 while jabbing his opponent's well-funded campaign. ""Big money may have won the battle, but they haven't won the war,"" he said. The challenge forced Abele to listen more attentively to the community, according to Larson. ""The Chris Abele that we ran against today is very different than the Chris Abele we were running against six months ago,"" he said. Larson promised to continue the pressure. ""This is a movement. And so, while we didn't win the battle today, we will the war,"" he said. ""We will continue to fight."" Abele pledged to complete the full term, dousing rumors of his interest in running for Wisconsin governor in 2018. Larson did not make the same pledge and had been expected to use this election as a springboard to run for governor in two years. One of Abele's consistent messages was that voters should rehire him based on a record of accomplishment during five years in the office. His list includes: reducing the projected county deficit and cutting annual debt payments; supporting bus transit services without increasing fares; boosting job training programs; adding more than 150 acres of parkland; and ending long-term institutional care of mental health patients at the troubled Mental Health Complex in Wauwatosa. Abele was first elected in 2011 in a special election to fill the final year in Scott Walker's term after Walker was elected governor. Abele was re-elected in 2012 to a full four-year term. As part of his campaign platform, Larson said he would push to add 1% to the sales tax collected here, to 6.6%, to provide dedicated funding for bus transit and parks maintenance, and reduce property taxes. The current 5.6% rate collected in the county is the maximum allowed under state law. With the extra revenue, Larson promised to lower bus fares and expand routes. Abele criticized Larson for promising such dedicated funding with a plan that could not be executed by a county executive without the backing of the Republican-controlled Legislature — an unlikely prospect at best. Rather than raising the sales tax, Abele suggested that the county ask the Legislature to restore state funding to Milwaukee County so that shared revenue and other payments are set at the same rate as other counties. Abele said he had not raised bus fares in his five years in office and had put more property tax dollars into the transit budget to replace cuts in state aid. Larson challenged Abele's collaboration with Republican lawmakers to add county executive authority while undercutting the County Board. His chief complaint of such collaboration is an amendment to the state budget law adopted in July by GOP lawmakers. The amendment gave the Milwaukee County executive authority to sell or lease county-owned land not zoned as a park without county board approval. Such a sale would need the approval of the comptroller or a municipal representative of the community where the land is located. Larson had been endorsed by the Wisconsin Working Families Party, which actively campaigned for him. County Supervisor Marina Dimitrijevic is state director of the group. Mark Johnson and Ellen Gabler of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report.",true/false
4,"Extremely hot days, when temperatures soar to 95 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, can be miserable. Crops wilt in the fields. Electric grids strain to keep pace with demand. People are at greater risk of dying. And those hot temperatures are expected to be much more frequent in the coming decades.  Global warming under Paris pledges  Global warming under Paris pledges  Days per year above 95°F 5 50 100 200  The map above, based on a new analysis from the Climate Impact Lab, shows how 95-degree days (35 degrees Celsius) are expected to multiply this century if countries take moderate climate action. In this scenario, countries would take some measures, but not drastic ones, to curb emissions — roughly the trajectory of the current pledges under the Paris climate agreement.  The resulting global warming would still cause significant shifts for many cities. In Washington, from 1986 to 2005, an average of seven days each year had temperatures of at least 95 degrees. By the end of the century, the city can expect 29 of these extremely hot days per year, on average. (The likely range is 14 to 46 hot days per year.)  Phoenix is used to the heat, averaging 124 days per year with 95-degree weather. At the end of the century, that’s expected to increase to around 155 days — an extra month of extreme temperatures each year. Madrid would go from eight severely hot days per year to 43, Beijing from nine to 35.  The swings are even greater closer to the equator. New Delhi, India’s capital city, has historically averaged 105 days with temperatures of at least 95 degrees each year. That’s likely to rise to a range of 137 to 200 days per year.  Things could get worse if countries fail to take action  If the world’s nations took no action on global warming, and emissions continued to rise at the same pace they did in the first decade of this century — with total global warming of 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit or more by the end of the century — extremely hot days would become much more commonplace.  Global warming if no action is taken  Global warming if no action is taken  Days per year above 95°F 5 50 100 200  By 2100, Washington could swelter in 95-degree weather for fully one-fifth of the year — around 74 days, on average. Large swaths of Brazil and sub-Saharan Africa would experience these temperatures for most of the year.  This worst case for global warming now appears less likely as global coal use declines and nations slowly move toward cleaner energy.  How 95-degree days disrupt our everyday lives  In the United States, electricity use soars as temperatures rise and more households use air-conditioning more frequently. One recent study found that the United States’ electric grid would have to handle a 7.2 percent increase in peak demand this century under a moderate warming scenario.  As temperature increases: Electricity consumption spikes. And crop yields plunge. Change in monthly California electricity usage relative to a 65°F day, 1999 to 2009.

In countries without widespread cooling, heat deaths rise more sharply during the hottest days. One study estimated that heat deaths in India increase by 3.2 percent for every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit above 68 (or every 1 degree Celsius above 20). Energy use in many countries may rise sharply as people struggle to adapt to a hotter climate.  Other scientists have found that corn and soybean yields in the United States plummet precipitously when temperatures rise above 84 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius), and that worker productivity declines sharply, particularly for outdoor jobs. And researchers are trying to understand how crime and conflict might rise as temperatures increase.  Ultimately, people will be better able to adapt if they have a better idea of what individual cities and regions can expect, said Trevor Houser, who co-directs the Climate Impact Lab. In the United States, some urban planners are already experimenting with techniques like adding green spaces or increasing the reflectivity of rooftops to cool down city centers during heat waves.  “Right now, when you start talking to people about higher temperatures, they tend to think, great, more beach days,” said Solomon Hsiang, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley who helps direct the lab. “What’s often less appreciated is just how much an extremely hot day can distort our lives in all sorts of ways we don’t often even think about.”",true/false

6,"“The greenhouse effect is here.”  – Jim Hansen, 23rd June 1988, Senate Testimony  The first transient climate projections using GCMs are 30 years old this year, and they have stood up remarkably well.  We’ve looked at the skill in the Hansen et al (1988) (pdf) simulations before (back in 2008), and we said at the time that the simulations were skillful and that differences from observations would be clearer with a decade or two’s more data. Well, another decade has passed!        How should we go about assessing past projections? There have been updates to historical data (what we think really happened to concentrations, emissions etc.), none of the future scenarios (A, B, and C) were (of course) an exact match to what happened, and we now understand (and simulate) more of the complex drivers of change which were not included originally.  The easiest assessment is the crudest. What were the temperature trends predicted and what were the trends observed? The simulations were run in 1984 or so, and that seems a reasonable beginning date for a trend calculation through to the last full year available, 2017. The modeled changes were as follows:  Scenario A: 0.33±0.03ºC/decade (95% CI)  Scenario B: 0.28±0.03ºC/decade (95% CI)  Scenario C: 0.16±0.03ºC/decade (95% CI)  The observed changes 1984-2017 are 0.19±0.03ºC/decade (GISTEMP), or 0.21±0.03ºC/decade (Cowtan and Way), lying between Scenario B and C, and notably smaller than Scenario A. Compared to 10 years ago, the uncertainties on the trends have halved, and so the different scenarios are more clearly distinguished. By this measure it is clear that the scenarios bracketed the reality (as they were designed to), but did not match it exactly. Can we say more by looking at the details of what was in the scenarios more specifically? Yes, we can.  This is what the inputs into the climate model were (CO 2 , N 2 O, CH 4 and CFC amounts) compared to observations (through to 2014):  Estimates of CO 2 growth in Scenarios A and B were quite good, but estimates of N 2 O and CH 4 overshot what happened (estimates of global CH 4 have been revised down since the 1980s). CFCs were similarly overestimated (except in scenario C which was surprisingly prescient!). Note that when scenarios were designed and started (in 1983), the Montreal Protocol had yet to be signed, and so anticipated growth in CFCs in Scenarios A and B was pessimistic. The additional CFC changes in Scenario A compared to Scenario B were intended to produce a maximum estimate of what other forcings (ozone pollution, other CFCs etc.) might have done.  But the model sees the net effect of all the trace gases (and whatever other effects are included, which in this case is mainly volcanoes). So what was the net forcing since 1984 in each scenario?  There are multiple ways of defining the forcings, and the exact value in any specific model is a function of the radiative transfer code and background climatology. Additionally, knowing exactly what the forcings in the real world have been is hard to do precisely. Nonetheless, these subtleties are small compared to the signal, and it’s clear that the forcings in Scenario A and B will have overshot the real world.        If we compare the H88 forcings since 1984 to an estimate of the total anthropogenic forcings calculated for the CMIP5 experiments (1984 through to 2012), the main conclusion is very clear – forcing in scenario A is almost a factor of two larger (and growing) than our best estimate of what happened, and scenario B overshoots by about 20-30%. By contrast, scenario C undershoots by about 40% (which gets worse over time). The slight differences because of the forcing definition, whether you take forcing efficacy into account and independent estimates of the effects of aerosols etc. are small effects. We can also ignore the natural forcings here (mostly volcanic), which is also a small effect over the longer term (Scenarios B and C had an “El Chichon”-like volcano go off in 1995).  The amount that scenario B overshoots the CMIP5 forcing is almost equal to the over-estimate of the CFC trends. Without that, it would have been spot on (the over-estimates of CH 4 and N 2 O are balanced by missing anthropogenic forcings).  The model predictions were skillful  Predictive skill is defined as the whether the model projection is better than you would have got assuming some reasonable null hypothesis. With respect to these projections, this was looked at by Hargreaves (2010) and can be updated here. The appropriate null hypothesis (which at the time would have been the most skillful over the historical record) would be a prediction of persistence of the 20 year mean, ie. the 1964-1983 mean anomaly. Whether you look at the trends or annual mean data, this gives positive skill for all the model projections regardless of the observational dataset used. i.e. all scenarios gave better predictions than a forecast based on persistence.        What do these projections tell us about the real world?  Can we make an estimate of what the model would have done with the correct forcing? Yes. The trends don’t completely scale with the forcing but a reduction of 20-30% in the trends of Scenario B to match the estimated forcings from the real world would give a trend of 0.20-0.22ºC/decade – remarkably close to the observations. One might even ask how would the sensitivity of the model need to be changed to get the observed trend? The equilibrium climate sensitivity of the Hansen model was 4.2ºC for doubled CO 2 , and so you could infer that a model with a sensitivity of say, 3.6ºC, would likely have had a better match (assuming that the transient climate response scales with the equilibrium value which isn’t quite valid).  Hansen was correct to claim that greenhouse warming had been detected  In June 1988, at the Senate hearing linked above, Hansen stated clearly that he was 99% sure that we were already seeing the effects of anthropogenic global warming. This is a statement about the detection of climate change – had the predicted effect ‘come out of the noise’ of internal variability and other factors? And with what confidence?  In retrospect, we can examine this issue more carefully. By estimating the response we would see in the global means from just natural forcings, and including a measure of internal variability, we should be able to see when the global warming signal emerged.        The shading in the figure (showing results from the CMIP5 GISS ModelE2), is a 95% confidence interval around the “all natural forcings” simulations. From this it’s easy to see that temperatures in 1988 (and indeed, since about 1978) fall easily outside the uncertainty bands. 99% confidence is associated with data more than ~2.6 standard deviations outside of the expected range, and even if you think that the internal variability is underestimated in this figure (double it to be conservative), the temperatures in any year past 1985 are more than 3 s.d. above the “natural” expectation. That is surely enough clarity to retrospectively support Hansen’s claim.  At the time however, the claim was more controversial; modeling was in it’s early stages, and estimates of internal variability and the relevant forcings were poorer, and so Hansen was going out on a little bit of a limb based on his understanding and insight into the problem. But he was right.  Misrepresentations and lies  Over the years, many people have misrepresented what was predicted and what could have been expected. Most (in)famously, Pat Michaels testified in Congress about climate changes and claimed that the predictions were wrong by 300% (!) – but his conclusion was drawn from a doctored graph (Cato Institute version) of the predictions where he erased the lower two scenarios:  Undoubtedly there will be claims this week that Scenario A was the most accurate projection of the forcings [Narrator: It was not]. Or they will show only the CO 2 projection (and ignore the other factors). Similarly, someone will claim that the projections have been “falsified” because the temperature trends in Scenario B are statistically distinguishable from those in the real world. But this sleight of hand is trying to conflate a very specific set of hypotheses (the forcings combined with the model used) which no-one expects (or expected) to perfectly match reality, with the much more robust and valid prediction that the trajectory of greenhouse gases would lead to substantive warming by now – as indeed it has.

EAST ANTARCTIC ICE SHEET  This is the last of three dispatches from a New York Times reporting trip to Antarctica.  From the air, the Ross Ice Shelf looks like a vast white plain extending to the horizon. The monochromatic landscape is relieved only occasionally by rocks poking through, or by deep crevasses in the ice itself.  Only at its edge does the ice shelf become something more dramatic: a spectacular sheer cliff rising 100 feet above the ocean and extending 900 feet below the surface. From that cliff edge, icebergs occasionally calve away, completing a thousand-year journey of the ice from land to sea.  Scientists are racing to understand what is happening to the Ross Ice Shelf — and the rest of Antarctica — as the planet warms around it. They are trying to map the thickness of the ice and the shape of the sea floor beneath it in an effort to gauge how vulnerable the shelf may be to collapse, and how soon that could happen.  Scientists are also trying to measure the role of human-caused climate change in weakening some parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet, and to fathom how damaging the seas around the continent might prove to be as they warm over time.  The edge of the Ross Ice Shelf.  The answers carry profound implications for humanity. In the scientists’ worst-case computer simulations, continued global warming will cause the Ross Ice Shelf to weaken and collapse starting as early as the middle of this century.  Right now, the shelf works like a giant bottle-stopper that slows down ice trying to flow from the land into the sea. If it collapses, the ice could flow into the ocean more rapidly, an effect that has already happened on a much smaller scale in other areas of Antarctica.  The most vulnerable parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet could raise the sea level by 10 to 15 feet, inundating many of the world’s coastal cities, though most scientists think that would take well over a century, or perhaps longer. They are worried about a possible rise of as much as six feet by the end of this century.  Whether these alarming forecasts ultimately prove right depends in part on the shape of the sea floor beneath the ice shelf, and in particular on whether it has deep channels that can funnel warming ocean water under the ice shelf and attack the West Antarctic ice sheet from below. A different undersea topography — high ridges of rock, for example — may keep warmer water out, stabilizing the ice sheet, possibly for hundreds of years.  “We’re hoping to figure out how warm water can get to the edge of the ice sheet,” said Robin E. Bell, head of the Columbia University laboratory that sent a team to survey the Ross Ice Shelf late last year. “What are the sort of hidden roads it can go on?”  As they flew back and forth across the vast white landscape in December, the Columbia scientists used some of the world’s most sophisticated geophysical instruments to see into and beneath the ice. As the hours-long flights wore on, the scientists took turns napping, knitting or eating cold pizza, but at all times, somebody kept close watch on the instruments.  Kirsty J. Tinto, the scientist leading the field team, loved watching as the measurements stripped away the illusion that the ice was just a flat, boring pancake.  “You take a slice through it and you can see a thousand years of history, a hundred million years of history,” she said.  Kirsty J. Tinto steps out of an LC-130 Hercules on the Ross Ice Shelf.  The Ross Ice Shelf appears stable now, so the Columbia project will function somewhat like a doctor’s baseline X-ray — a starting point for comparison if the ice starts to deteriorate.  Satellite evidence suggests that this is already happening in other parts of West Antarctica, and many scientists believe that relatively warm ocean water is the culprit. “It’s kind of a blowtorch on the underside of the ice shelf,” said Robert A. Bindschadler, a retired NASA climate scientist.  But the story is not straightforward, and the warmer water attacking the ice has not been linked to global warming — at least not directly. The winds around the continent seem to be strengthening, stirring the ocean and bringing up a layer of warmer water that has most likely been there for centuries.  Are those stronger winds tied to human-caused global warming? Some scientists think so, but others say the case is unproven. “We’re not sure because we don’t have enough data, for long enough, to separate signal from noise,” said Eric J. Steig, a scientist at the University of Washington who has studied temperature trends in Antarctica.  Though the role of global warming is unclear now, it is likely to be a factor in the relatively near future. Many experts think warmer air temperatures could start to weaken the ice of West Antarctica from above, even as warmer ocean water attacks it from below.  The warmer water seems to be doing the most damage to a series of glaciers that flow into a region of West Antarctica called the Amundsen Sea. Satellites have identified the most rapid loss of ice there, raising a critical question: Has an unstoppable collapse of the ice sheet already begun?  Ross Ice Shelf Pine Island Glacier Thwaites Glacier Ross Sea Amundsen Sea Pine Island Glacier Thwaites Glacier Amundsen Sea Red areas have lost significant amounts of ice since 2010.  The Amundsen Sea region is one of the remotest parts of the continent, far from American and British research bases. Working together, the two countries are planning to devote tens of millions of dollars to getting better measurements there, having decided that it is imperative to begin answering questions about the region’s potential collapse.  For instance, scientists need to know a lot more about the ground beneath the glaciers there. Is it slick mud that may allow the ice to flow much faster, or hard rock that may slow down the ice even in a warmer world?  “What we need to know is really the details of what is occurring where the ice, ocean and land all come together,” said Ted A. Scambos, a University of Colorado scientist who is helping to plan the joint research effort.  Unraveling the answers, and gaining a better understanding of how Antarctica’s ice has waxed and waned in the past, may offer a rough guide to the changes that human-caused global warming could wreak in the future.  Already, scientists know enough to be concerned. About 120,000 years ago, before the last ice age, the planet went through a natural warm period, with temperatures similar to those expected in coming decades.  The sea level was 20 to 30 feet higher than it is today, implying that the ice sheets in both Greenland and Antarctica must have partly disintegrated, a warning of what could occur in the relatively near future if the heating of the planet continues unchecked.  But some research suggests that a catastrophe might not yet be inevitable. In a study last year, Robert M. DeConto of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and David Pollard of Pennsylvania State University used their computer model to predict what would happen if emissions were reduced sharply over the next few decades, in line with international climate goals.  Under the most ambitious scenarios, they found a strong likelihood that Antarctica would remain fairly stable.  “There’s still a chance that all hell will break loose,” Dr. DeConto said. “But the model is suggesting there’s a way to reduce the risk of a big sea-level rise from Antarctica.”",true/false
9,"Self-harm and violent attacks have hit record levels in prisons across England and Wales for the second time in a year, despite repeated warnings that jails are at crisis point and in desperate need of reform. More than 46,850 self-harm incidents were recorded in the year to March 2018, up by 16 per cent on the previous year, with self-harm now recorded on average 128 times a day. Violent incidents meanwhile rose to 31,025, up 16 per cent, and of which 9,003 were assaults on staff – a figure that has soared by more than a quarter 26 per cent in the 12 months to March. It comes after the prison watchdog proclaimed that inmates in England and Wales were enduring some of the “most disturbing conditions ever seen” as authorities fail to take action to curb soaring levels of violence and self-harm. Peter Clarke said “repeated patterns of failure” had led to a point where staff had be inured to conditions that have “no place in an advanced nation in the 21st century”. The data shows that self-harm incidents requiring hospital attendance increased by 12 per cent to 3,095, meaning on average nine inmates a day require hospital treatment after harming themselves. Women were increasingly more likely to self-harm, with 2,244 incidents recorded per 1,000 female inmates - an increase of 24 per cent - compared with 467 incidents per 1,000 in male establishments, marking a rise of 14 per cent from the previous year.

Read our privacy notice The figures show that 310 people died in prison custody in the 12 months to the end of June 2018, including 77 people who lost their lives through suicide. There were 3,926 serious assaults in the year to March, up 9 per cent, and there were five apparent homicides, up from two incidents in the previous year. The 26 per cent rise in assaults on staff will fuel existing concerns over staff retention rates after The independent revealed that the number of prison officers resigning had more than doubled in the last two years. Separate figures published by the Ministry of Justice show that 15 prisons have been given the worst possible score in the department's annual prison performance ratings. The shadow justice secretary said the figures marked a “new low point in this government's mismanagement of our prisons system”. Richard Burgon continued: “Despite all the rhetoric from the Government that it is finally getting a grip of the prisons emergency, we now have an assault every 20 minutes in our prisons and the number of prisons labelled as being of ‘serious concern’ is at its highest in years. “The blame for this prisons emergency lies squarely with the Conservative's decision to axe thousands of prison officers and slash the prisons budget. “If the government is serious about tackling this crisis then it needs to outline an emergency plan and new funds to make our prisons safe.” Andrew Neilson, director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform, meanwhile said: “With incidents of self-injury happening every 11 minutes, with assaults occurring every 17 minutes and with six people dying in prison every week, the government must act boldly and decisively to prevent more bloodshed behind bars. “Reducing the number of people in prison would save lives, protect staff and prevent more people being swept into deeper currents of crime, violence and despair.” Deborah Coles, director of INQUEST said the only way to improve safety and reduce prison deaths was to dramatically cut the prison population and invest in community alternatives. She highlighted that the number of deaths awaiting classification over the period had more than doubled, with the majority of people found unresponsive in their cells. The undetermined nature of these deaths raises questions as to whether they are drug related or due to undiagnosed or untreated health conditions, she said. Findings from inquests continue to expose neglect and inadequate health and mental health care as contributing to avoidable and premature deaths. The criminal justice system cannot deal with societal problems of mental and physical ill heath, drug misuse and poverty.” UK news in pictures Show all 50 1 /50 UK news in pictures UK news in pictures 13 April 2021 The core of the Milky Way becomes visible in the early hours of Tuesday morning as it moves over Bamburgh Lighthouse at stag Rock in Northumberland PA UK news in pictures 12 April 2021 Rebecca Richardson left and Genevieve Florence, members of the Aquabatix synchronised swimming team, during a practice session in the swimming pool at Clissold Leisure Centre in north London, which has reopened to the public.

10,"A wide-ranging domestic terrorism investigation of ""The Base,"" a militant neo-Nazi group, has culminated in the arrests of seven alleged members last week and has provided extensive new details about the inside operations of an organization that authorities say advocates for a ""violent insurgency"" to overthrow the U.S. government.  The investigation comes amid an increased focus on domestic terrorism and white supremacy in the United States and fear that such groups are joining forces with like-minded individuals overseas. And it came to light in the context of a controversial Richmond, Virginia gun rally where alleged members of The Base plotted to attack police officers and civilians.  According to a review of court documents released in cases out of Maryland, Georgia and Wisconsin over the past week, investigators believe the group was founded “in or around July 2018” by white nationalists who look to promote and plot acts of violence with an overarching goal of inciting a race war to create “a white ethno-state.”  “Members of The Base communicate with each other through online platforms and encrypted online messaging applications and chat rooms,” FBI special agent Jessica Krueger wrote in an affidavit filed in a Wisconsin District Court last week. “In these communications, they have discussed, among other things, acts of violence against minorities (including African Americans and Jewish Americans), Base military training camps, and ways to make improvised explosive devices.”  Three alleged members of the group were arrested in Maryland and Delaware on federal gun and immigration charges. Three others were arrested in Georgia on state gang charges and conspiracy to commit murder. Another man was arrested in Wisconsin and charged with conspiracy to vandalize a synagogue.  According to a court filing Tuesday in Maryland, The Base’s leaders are “particularly interested in applicants with military and explosives backgrounds.”  “Applicants submit an application form, which includes questions regarding the applicant’s current associations with white supremacist organizations; the applicant’s military, science, and engineering experiences and training; and the applicant’s race and gender,” the filing said.  It’s not entirely clear, based on the court filings, how many followers the group has -- though investigators have identified what they say is a clear leadership structure and found that members had divided into several separate “regional chapters.”  For instance, one such chapter in Wisconsin is identified as the “Great Lakes cell,” whose members organized an armed training session after passing out recruitment fliers at Marquette University in July of last year, according to the court filings.  “The Base cells have a significant degree of autonomy regarding their activities, and criminal conduct is typically not centrally coordinated in order to foster “plausible deniability” among those not directly involved,” an FBI affidavit said.  The FBI says it gained access to The Base’s encrypted online messaging application in July 2019, when an undercover agent participated in an online vetting interview and then personally met with members of the group in Georgia.  For months, according to the FBI, the agent continued meeting and participating in weapons training exercises with three members of The Base, who were arrested on state charges last week after the agent revealed their alleged plot to assassinate two members of the radical group ‘Antifa.’  From those interactions and The Base’s online messaging, investigators say they believe members participated in such training exercises in preparation for “The Boogaloo,” a moniker that, according to the authorities, the group’s members use to “describe the collapse of the United States and subsequent race war.”  One alleged member of the group arrested last week, former Canadian army reservist Patrik Mathews, had allegedly invoked ""The Boogaloo"" in connection to an attack the group planned to conduct on a pro-gun rights rally that occurred in Richmond over the weekend, according to the FBI.  “You want to create f----- some instability, while the Virginia situation is happening, make other things happen, derail some rail lines… like shut down the highways… you know, you can kick off the economic collapse of the U.S. within a week, after the boog starts,” Mathews said in a conversation federal agents say was recorded in his Delaware residence.  During a so-called ‘sneak-and-peek’ search of his residence prior to Mathews’ arrest, agents took pictures of items used to assemble assault rifles, “go-bags” with military-supplies like ‘Meals-Ready-To-Eat’ (MREs), and found several videos of Mathews in a gas-mask where he discussed killing people “in furtherance of the movement,” according to an FBI affidavit  “If you are not getting physically fit, if you are not getting armed, if you do not acquiring weapons, ammunition, and training right… now, then you should be preparing to do what needs to be done,” Mathews said in one video, according to FBI documents. “Derail some [sic] trains, kill some people, and poison some water supplies.”  A magistrate judge in Maryland ordered Mathews to remain in detention pending his trial, in which he has not yet entered a plea on federal gun and immigration charges, related to an alleged illegal entry into the U.S.  At a hearing Wednesday, Matthews' lawyer defended his client.  “One man’s domestic terrorist can be another man’s exercise of his First Amendment rights,” said the lawyer, Joseph Balter.  “This is a very dangerous person, espousing very dangerous beliefs,” the judge said Wednesday.  According to authorities, Mathews’ alleged involvement in The Base, after they say he entered the country illegally in August of last year, underscores their concerns that its influence stretches well beyond the U.S.  According to court filings, investigators say the group has been “building” a coalition “within the United States and abroad” and specifically mentioned members communicating with individuals in the United Kingdom and at least one member who discussed traveling to Ukraine, “to fight with nationalists there.”  Just last week, the Justice Department’s top terrorism coordinator said that the threat facing the U.S. from potential domestic terrorists is shifting in nature and becoming an increasingly transnational issue, with law enforcement seeing more Americans engaging and finding inspiration from overseas right-wing extremist groups -- in some cases even traveling abroad to meet with their members.  ""This issue in many respects has become transnational in nature,"" DOJ’s counsel for domestic terrorism Thomas Brzozowski said during an event at George Washington University. ""Some folks cite one another, others gain or gather support from another, use the same contacts and techniques without any demonstrable connection that would constitute conspiracy or things of that nature.”  Brzozowski specifically pointed to the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen, whose members have traveled to train with right-wing groups in Ukraine and eastern Europe. According to prosecutors, some Atomwaffen members have also joined ranks with The Base.",true/false
11,"You might have missed it amid all the sound and fury of impeachment, but it’s been a busy week for disinformation. Twitter, the Wall Street Journal reports, will start removing posts that it determines are “misleading about an election.” Elizabeth Warren’s campaign rolled out a plan on “Fighting Digital Disinformation,” including a pledge not to “knowingly use or spread false or manipulated information.” And the House Ethics Committee announced that members of the House of Representatives who share deepfakes on social media might face sanctions from the House itself. The ethics announcement attracted the least attention of all, but it’s actually an important step in creating standards for how elected representatives should use social media.  This news might seem trivial compared to the drama of the impeachment trial going on just down the street. But as technology companies and governments alike grapple with how to address the spread of online falsehoods, the committee’s memo is noteworthy. Four years after the shock to the system of 2016, everyone agrees that disinformation and misinformation are problems that need to be dealt with, but the question remains who is best positioned to accept responsibility. The House of Representatives appears to be, in some small way, beginning to take on the task.  The committee’s “pink sheet”—an advisory memorandum on House rules—alerts members of the House to the dangers of posting deepfakes on social media, warning that “manipulation of images and videos that are intended to mislead the public can harm … discourse and reflect discreditably on the House.” For this reason, disseminating “deep fakes or other audio-visual distortions intended to mislead the public” could violate the House’s Code of Official Conduct, which governs the behavior of the chamber’s members and employees.  This might sound like the committee is addressing a problem that doesn’t exist yet. As far as we know, there have not been any cases in which a member of Congress—or any other prominent American political figure—has tweeted a genuine deepfake, meaning doctored audio or video generated through machine learning than can produce extremely lifelike and misleading results. After all, deepfakes—though concerning—just aren’t all that common in politics (yet).  Politicians have, however, published plenty of what the memorandum describes as “other audio-visual distortions”—that is, photos or video deceptively manipulated in a less sophisticated manner than a deepfake. Sometimes the manipulation is obvious: President Trump recently tweeted a picture altered to depict him putting a Medal of Honor around the neck of a dog that played a role in the raid on Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (the original photo showed the president bestowing the medal to a Vietnam War medic). But U.S. political figures have published more deceptive images, too. Three days after the strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, Rep. Paul Gosar tweeted a photo appearing to show President Obama shaking hands with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani; it took 40 minutes before he acknowledged that the picture was actually a fake, a doctored version of a shot from a 2011 meeting between Obama and then-Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.  The world is a better place without these guys in power. pic.twitter.com/gDoXQu9vO5 — Paul Gosar (@DrPaulGosar) January 6, 2020  It’s easy to see why the committee might be particularly concerned about these manipulations now. Quoting a Congressional Research Service article on deepfakes, the memo warns that when members of the House or their staff tweet or share deepfakes or other manipulated audio or video, they could “erode public trust, negatively affect public discourse, or even sway an election.” Consider, for example, the misleadingly edited video tweeted out by President Trump in May 2019 that appeared to display Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi slurring her words at a news conference—or the wide circulation of a deceptive clip that seemed to show Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden make a racist remark. Now imagine such a clip, with sophisticated editing or not, circulated in the days or even hours before an election—and given the appearance of legitimacy by retweets from members of Congress and perhaps even the president himself.  The memo changes the calculation for members: Tweet misleading content, and you could be subject to House disciplinary rules. The Ethics Committee asks members and staff to think before they tweet: Before posting on social media, “[m]embers and staff are expected to take reasonable efforts to consider whether such representations are deep fakes or are intentionally distorted to mislead the public.” Members who break this guidance could be subject to public admonition by the committee of the offending members. Technically, the full House could even censure members—or expel them for violation of House rules.  Censure is unlikely, though, and expulsion even less so. Only five members have ever met the latter fate, three of whom were expelled for fighting for the Confederacy. Tweeting a deepfake may be harmful to democracy, but it might not be quite the same as taking up arms against the republic.  More realistically, the committee may hope that the guideline itself will have a deterrent effect. The committee is often reluctant to discipline members, so the most realistic deterrent may come from members’ desire to avoid scrutiny from the Office of Congressional Ethics, which investigates and produces public reports about ethics violations. As former senior counsel to the House Michael L. Stern, told us, “[T]he primary motivation for complying with this edict is not the formal sanction, but the embarrassment of getting called out for violations, as well as the desire to avoid an investigation” by either the committee or the independent Office of Congressional Ethics.  In this way, the pink sheet is a norm-setting exercise for the House—and a bipartisan one, as the committee is the only one in the House evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. When members tweet doctored pictures or share altered videos, they now do so as knowing violators of the House’s position on this type of content.  So the guidelines set out in the memo might not have that much bite. Yet they still represent a shift from the current state of things—which is to say, an ad hoc system in which tech platforms are effectively building the content moderation plane in midair, setting out broad rules and then struggling to decide the extent to which politicians get special treatment. The result of these efforts has been that, by and large, citizens and users of the major platforms have come to think of the platforms themselves as the governing bodies to whom appeals should be addressed when a prominent political figure publishes misleading or objectionable content. Every time President Trump posts a threat on Twitter, for example, hundreds of other users will tweet at Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and other executives demanding to know why the platform won’t remove content that appears to violate its terms of service.  Hey @Twitter, is threatening nuclear war not a violation of terms of service? https://t.co/Gwz2EZHKnu — Kal Penn (@kalpenn) August 11, 2017  The situation has become so commonplace that it may no longer seem strange. But there is something bizarre about the notion that private platforms not only can regulate what and how politicians communicate with their constituents and the rest of the world, but that those platforms should. As any number of scholars and journalists have pointed out, the responsibility of deciding what speech is and is not within the bounds of acceptable discourse is, on its face, a task better suited to democratic governance than private enterprise. The Ethics Committee guidance is a small step toward governmental institutions accepting at least some of that burden.  That said, the House shouldering part of that weight means that the chamber will now have to grapple with some of the puzzling content moderation questions that only platforms have dealt with until now. Just as Twitter or Facebook users whose content is removed will appeal to the platforms to argue that their posts don’t violate the terms of service, surely the Ethics Committee and the Office of Congressional Ethics are going to be faced with the problem of assessing whether a member or staffer has actually violated the rule. Recall that the memo’s prohibition includes an intent requirement—so a member who shares a deepfake could argue that he or she too was duped, or explain that the shared deepfake was not a deception, but merely a joke. In fact, after he published the fake image of Obama shaking hands with Rouhani, that’s exactly what Gosar did: “[N]o one said this wasn’t photoshopped. No one said the president of Iran was dead. No one said Obama met with Rouhani in person,” Gosar wrote.  Then there are the new questions that emerge from two sets of overlapping rules between the House and the platforms, which will create headaches for both parties. Platforms are likely to face two situations: those in which a member spreads misleading content that appears to violate the terms of the memo and the House does nothing, and those in which the House issues some sort of sanction.  In the first case, where a member spreads misleading content but the committee takes no action, there will no doubt still be calls—as there are every time something similar happens—for platforms to do something. These calls are natural: Platforms have the greatest capacity to stop the spread of content on their services by using their content moderation infrastructure, and so it feels like they should exercise it. But, as noted above, it is jarring to ask a private company, with no democratic mandate or legitimacy, to take action against the speech of a public representative when the House Committee on Ethics itself has not done so. This situation appears to be a lose-lose for platforms: Take no action and they will continue to face charges of negligence in their roles at gatekeepers; do something and they will appear to be usurping the role of the committee to police the boundaries of acceptable conduct by elected representatives.  The second case isn’t easy either. Where a particular post has resulted in sanction from the committee, what should platforms do to best facilitate democratic accountability? Continuing to allow false content to spread might allow it to continue to do harm. But removing a post by a representative could prevent constituents from holding their member of Congress accountable, because fewer people will be aware of the post in the first place.  This situation calls for thinking outside the binary of taking down content or leaving it up, which platforms are starting to show in other cases—like flagging content that has been rated false by fact-checkers, or Twitter’s (as yet unused) policy of placing warning screens on content that breaks its rules but is in the public interest. When it comes to deepfakes and other “synthetic and manipulated media,” for example, Twitter has proposed placing a notice next to such posts or adding some other kind of warning, which could mesh well with whatever action the committee takes. Similarly, platforms could reduce circulation of misleading content that is the subject of committee censure and add context noting the committee’s action.  And, as ever, there’s the little matter of what to do about the president. The Ethics Committee can pass whatever rules it likes for members, but that’s not going to stop Trump from tweeting and retweeting. What happens if, for example, members of the House retweet a Trump tweet containing a misleadingly edited video? The members might be censured while the president would remain untouched.  Then again, perhaps this mirrors the struggles of Twitter itself: Puzzled by how to handle presidential tweets, the platform has written into its terms of service an exception for “newsworthiness,” which essentially allows Trump to publish whatever he likes. (Other platforms have similar rules.) Of course, the House has no power over Trump’s Twitter feed, and while the platform could limit his tweets if it wanted, it has decided not to.  The Ethics Committee is now going to get a taste of the absurdities and contradictions of regulating social media. We’ll have to wait and see whether Twitter users start tweeting at the committee as well as @jack and asking that congressional tweets be taken down—or demanding to know why members have been unjustly punished.",true/false

13,"The number of Britons taking up EU citizenship of another member state more than doubled in the year of the Brexit referendum, official EU figures show.  Eurostat, the EU’s statistics agency, shows that 6,555 British nationals acquired such citizenship in 2016, up from 2,478 in 2015.  Germany was the biggest country for Britons to adopt the citizenship of, with 2,702. France and Belgium followed with 517 and 506 citizens each.  Other​ significant beneficiaries of British citizens were Cyprus, Ireland and Italy.  “We are seeing a Brexodus of people giving up their passports and rushing to take citizenship in EU countries as Brexit draws near,” Paul Butters, a spokesperson for the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign, said.  “People have done this to give themselves some security. This should make David Davis ashamed that people feel they have no option but to give up their citizenship or apply to be a dual national. These people are giving up part of their identity to try to secure their future.  “The government don’t seem to care and their only interest is their ill advised ‘tens of thousands’ immigration target.  “The government dragged their feet over EU citizens’ rights and this is the real life manifestation of their tactics.

British citizens will lose the automatic rights to work and settle in other EU countries after Brexit, making UK passports less powerful. The government has, however, said British passports will be changed to blue, which Brexiteers claimed could not be the case while the UK was still in the bloc.  The EU referendum was held on 23 June 2016 meaning that any acceleration of applications for citizenship after the referendum would only have applied in the second half of the year.

One possible post-Brexit immigration scheme could struggle to channel workers towards less attractive roles - while another may heighten the risk of labour exploitation, a new report warns. PA The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Customs union A key point in the negotiations remains Britain's access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does? No 10 has so far insisted that “Brexit means Brexit” and that Britain will be leaving the customs union, but may be inclined to change its position once the potential risks to the UK’s economic outlook become clearer. Alamy The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Northern Ireland-Irish border Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. To ensure borderless travel on the island, the countries must be in regulatory alignment and therefore adhere to the same rules as the customs union. In December, the Conservative Party’s coalition partners, the DUP, refused a draft agreement that would place the UK/EU border in the Irish Sea due to its potential to undermine the union. May has promised that would not be the case and has suggested that a “specific solution” would need to be found. Getty The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Transition period Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit. The talks, however, have reached an impasse. Though May has agreed that the UK will continue to contribute to the EU budget until 2021, the PM wants to be able to select which laws made during this time the UK will have to adhere to. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said the UK must adopt all of the laws passed during the transition, without any input from British ministers or MEPs. EPA The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Rights of EU citizens living the UK The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear. May insists that those who arrive during the transition period should not be allowed to stay, whereas the EU believe the cut-off point should be later. Getty The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Future trade agreement with the EU Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU. Infighting within the Cabinet has prevented a solid position from being reached, with some MPs content that no deal is better than a bad deal while others rally behind single market access. The EU has already confirmed that access to the single market would be impossible without the UK remaining in the customs union. Getty The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Future trade agreements internationally The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London. However the UK cannot make trade agreements with another country while it is still a member of the EU, and the potential loss of trade with the world's major powers is a source of anxiety for the PM. The EU has said the UK cannot secure trade deals during the transition period. EPA The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Financial services Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal. However according to new reports Germany has suggested allowing trade on the condition that the UK continues paying into the EU budget even after the transition period. Getty  Ireland’s Department of Foreign Affairs said in late 2017 that more than a fifth of all Irish passports issued in the last year went to people living in the UK.  The department in Dublin said more than 779,000 of the Republic’s passports were issued in 2017, a record figure, with 81,752 Irish citizens in Northern Ireland being among those who received passports.

14,"Muslim women are the most economically disadvantaged group in British society, according to a report by MPs. Ministers must introduce a plan to tackle the inequalities before the end of the year, the Women and Equalities Committee said. Figures suggest they are three times more likely to be unemployed jobseekers than women generally, and twice as likely to be economically inactive. The government said it was committed to making Britain work for everyone. Progress has been made, with 45% more Muslim women in work than in 2011, but ministers know there is much more to do, a government spokesman added. 'Discrimination' Many Muslim women in Britain face a triple penalty impacting on their job prospects - being women, being from an ethnic minority and being Muslim, the committee suggested. It cited Office for National Statistics ONS figures for 2015, which found 35% of all Muslim women from 16 to 64 were in employment. By contrast, 69% of all British working-age women were in employment between March and May this year. The starkest comparison was in the proportion of women who are classed as economically inactive - that is, unemployed and not seeking work. The 2015 ONS figures found that 58% of Muslim women were economically inactive. By contrast, 27% of all working-age women in the UK were economically inactive between March and May. The percentage of Muslim women unemployed and seeking work was 16%, the ONS found - compared with 5% of women nationally. The unemployment rate is calculated as a percentage of those who are economically active. The figures suggest Muslim women are the least economically successful group in British society, the report added. The report cited Demos's analysis of the 2011 Census which found that nearly half 44% of economically inactive Muslim women are inactive because they are looking after the home; this compares with a national average of 16% of women who are inactive for this reason. The report cited a number of contributing factors: Family pressures: There was a conventional cultural acknowledgement among Muslims that women are homemakers and men are breadwinners, academics told the committee Islamophobia: Evidence suggested the biggest cause of the acute disadvantage felt by Muslim women was their religion, and impact of Islamophobia on Muslim women should not be underestimated Recruitment discrimination: Muslim women can face discrimination based on their name, religious or cultural dress, and are more likely to be asked about marriage, childcare or family aspirations, the MPs suggest Role of mosques: Some mosques were failing to involve Muslin women in the way they were run, which could have a negative impact on attitudes and women's attempts to find work, the report said Poverty and language barriers: The committee heard evidence that English language skills continue to be a barrier for some, and poverty disproportionately affects the Muslim population line 'Not a nice feeling' media captionTwo British Muslim women have been talking about their experience of the workplace A 21-year-old Muslim graduate from Manchester has spoken to BBC News anonymously about what she believes was discrimination when she applied for a sales job. She said: There were two phone interviews... and I got brilliant feedback. They said 'You sound absolutely perfect for this role' and said I was very articulate - that kind of thing. But the 21-year-old said that when it came to a face-to-face group interview, during which she was the only person wearing a headscarf, there was a change in the tone. I felt they were strange, and there was a bit of a change in the atmosphere, and that was not a nice feeling for me, she said. She did not get the position. It has lessened my confidence a little bit when going for face-to face interviews, I definitely think I'm more confident over the phone, she added. line The report refers to a chill factor where the perception and fear of discrimination or hostile work colleagues puts Muslim women off applying for certain jobs. The MPs called on ministers to roll out name-blind recruitment to all employers, so that recruiters do not see applicants' names, following evidence that job applicants with white-sounding names are more likely to get an interview. Married women in Muslim communities are often expected to be home-makers while their husbands are the breadwinners, the committee heard from expert witnesses. The impact of the very real inequality, discrimination and Islamophobia that Muslim women experience is exacerbated by the pressures that some women feel from parts of their communities to fulfil a more traditional role, the committee said. But Faeeza Vaid from the Muslim Women's Network stressed that while family pressure may be an issue for a small proportion of Muslim women, many other women were breaking stereotypes in a wide range of roles from doctors to pilots. The committee said attitudes were changing, but not fast enough, saying the government must introduce a plan to tackle the inequalities faced by Muslims by the end of the year. We call on the government to introduce a role models and mentoring programme aimed at Muslim women to help them realise their potential in employment, the report said. Maria Miller, who chairs the Women and Equalities Committee, said: Muslim women particularly, face really unacceptable levels of discrimination and that discrimination comes from the workplace, from employers, but also from within communities as well.",true/false
15,"A worker conducts testing during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Liberia. Credit: John Saindon/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CC BY 2.0.  Once a COVID-19 vaccine is approved for public use, officials around the world will face the monumental challenge of vaccinating billions of people, a logistical operation rife with thorny ethical questions. What if instead of orchestrating complicated and resource-intensive campaigns to vaccinate humans against emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19, we could instead stop the zoonotic diseases that sometimes leap from animals to people at their source? A small, but growing number of scientists think it’s possible to exploit the self-propagating properties of viruses and use them to spread immunity instead of disease. Can we beat viruses like SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus, at their own game?  A virus that confers immunity throughout an animal population as it spreads in the wild could theoretically stop a zoonotic spillover event from happening, snuffing out the spark that could ignite the next pandemic. If the wild rats that host the deadly Lassa virus, for example, are vaccinated, the risks of a future outbreak among humans could be reduced. For at least 20 years, scientists have been experimenting with such self-spreading vaccines, work that continues to this day, and which has gained the attention of the US military.  For obvious reasons, public and scientific interest in vaccines is incredibly high, including in self-spreading vaccines, as they could be effective against zoonotic threats. The biologists Scott Nuismer and James Bull generated fresh media attention to self-spreading vaccines over the summer after publishing an article in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. But the subsequent reporting on the topic gives short shrift to the potentially significant downsides to releasing self-spreading vaccines into the environment.  Self-spreading vaccines could indeed entail serious risks, and the prospect of using them raises challenging questions.  Who decides, for instance, where and when a vaccine should be released? Once released, scientists will no longer be in control of the virus. It could mutate, as viruses naturally do. It may jump species. It will cross borders. There will be unexpected outcomes and unintended consequences. There always are.  While it may turn out to be technically feasible to fight emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19, AIDS, Ebola, and Zika with self-spreading viruses, and while the benefits may be significant, how does one weigh those benefits against what may be even greater risks?  How they work. Self-spreading vaccines are essentially genetically engineered viruses designed to move through populations in the same way as infectious diseases, but rather than causing disease, they confer protection. Built on the chassis of a benign virus, the vaccines have genetic material from a pathogen added to them that stimulates the creation of antibodies or white blood cells in “infected” hosts.  These vaccines could be particularly useful, some scientists say, for wildlife populations where direct vaccination is difficult due to issues like inaccessible habitats, poor infrastructure, high costs, or lack of resources. The idea, essentially, is to vaccinate a small proportion of a population through direct inoculation. These so-called founders will then passively spread the vaccine to other animals they encounter either by touch, sex, nursing, or breathing the same air. Gradually, these interactions could build up population-level immunity.  Self-spreading vaccines have some of their roots in efforts to reduce pest populations. Australian researchers described a virally spread immunocontraception, which hijacked the immune systems of infected animals—in this case a non-native mouse species in Australia—and prevented them from fertilizing offspring. The earliest self-spreading vaccine efforts targeted two highly lethal infectious diseases in the European rabbit population (myxoma virus and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus). In 2001, Spanish researchers field-tested a vaccine in a wild rabbit population living on Isla del Aire, a small Spanish island just off Menorca. The vaccine spread to more than half the 300 rabbits on the island, and the trial was deemed a success.  In 2015, another team of researchers speculated on the development of a self-spreading vaccine for the Ebola virus that could be used on wild great apes like chimpanzees. Since then, scientists have come to see a wide array of animals—from wildlife such as bats, birds, and foxes to domesticated animals like dogs, pigs, and sheep—as amenable to self-spreading vaccines.  So far, researchers have not developed experimental self-spreading vaccines for humans; there is no clear evidence that anybody is actively working on the technology. Nuismer and Bull argue, rather, that self-spreading vaccines present a revolutionary approach to control emerging infectious diseases before they even spill over from animals into the human population.  Zoonotic spillover is certainly a pressing problem; alongside SARS-CoV-2, HIV, Ebola virus, and the Zika virus, there are over a thousand other new viruses with zoonotic potential that have been detected in wild animals over the last decade. Prevention is better than a cure, Nuismer and Bull say in a New Scientist article. In their Nature Ecology & Evolution article, they claim they are “poised to begin developing self-disseminating vaccines to target a wide range of human pathogens” in animals.  Outside of an experiment, scientists would face massive technical and practical hurdles in identifying the most appropriate targets for intervention and ensuring immunity is maintained in the wildlife populations. Despite these substantial challenges, the potential security implications of self-spreading vaccines are even more serious.  The principal security concern is that of dual-use. In essence, this means that the same research that is used to develop self-spreading vaccines to prevent disease, could also be used to deliberately cause harm. You could, for instance, engineer triggers into a virus that cause immune system failures in infected people or animals, a bit like HIV does naturally. Or you could create triggers in a virus that cause a harmful autoimmune response, where the body starts attacking its own healthy cells and tissues.  The bioweapon question. While researchers may intend to make self-spreading vaccines, others could repurpose their science and develop biological weapons. Such a self-spreading weapon may prove uncontrollable and irreversible.  We don’t have to dig very deep for a historical example of weaponized biology. As the apartheid-era South African biowarfare program shows, social, political, and scientific pressures can lead to the misuse of biological innovation.  Codenamed Project Coast, South Africa’s program was primarily focused on covert assassination weapons for use against individuals deemed a threat to the racist apartheid government. In addition to producing contraptions to inject poisons, Project Coast researchers developed techniques to lace sugar cubes with salmonella and cigarettes with Bacillus anthracis.  While there have been many biowarfare programs, including several that were far more elaborate and sophisticated, the South African program is particularly relevant in thinking through malicious uses of self-spreading vaccines. One of Project Coast’s research projects aimed at developing a human anti-fertility vaccine.  The idea took hold during a time of widespread concern over worldwide population explosion. Schalk Van Rensburg, who oversaw fertility-related work at a Project Coast laboratory, told South Africa’s post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a forum for examining the sordid history of the era and laying the foundation for future peace and tolerance, that he thought the project was in line with the World Health Organization’s attempts to curb rising global birth rates. He believed it could bring his lab international acclaim and funding. According to Van Rensburg, Wouter Basson, the director of the biowarfare program, said the military needed an anti-fertility vaccine so that female soldiers would not fall pregnant.  While some of the scientists involved in the project denied awareness of ulterior intentions or even that their fertility work was part of a military endeavor, Van Rensburg and Daniel Goosen, a lab director, told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that the real intention behind the project was to selectively administer the contraceptive in secret to unwitting Black South African women.  In the end, the anti-fertility vaccine was not produced before Project Coast was officially closed down in 1995, 12 years after it was initiated. An early version was tested in baboons, but never in humans. South Africa isn’t the only country to try and forcibly sterilize parts of its population. European countries, including Sweden and Switzerland, sterilized members of the Roma minority in the early half of the 20th century and some, like Slovakia, continued even beyond that. More recently, analysts have alleged that the Chinese government is sterilizing women in Xinjiang, a province with a large population of Uighur Muslims.  It doesn’t take a massive leap of the imagination to see how the aims of South Africa’s anti-fertility vaccine project would have benefited from research into self-spreading vaccines, particularly if you combine it with current developments in pharmacogenomics, drug development, and personalized medicine. Taken together, these strands of research could help enable ultra-targeted biological warfare.  An expanding potential for abuse. The Biological Weapons Convention, the treaty that bans biological weapons, is nearly 50 years old. Negotiated and agreed to in the depths of the Cold War, the convention suffers from outdated modes of operation. There are also significant compliance assessment challenges. The convention certainly didn’t stop South Africa from pursuing Project Coast in the early 1980s.  Self-spreading vaccine research is a small but growing field. At the moment, about 10 institutions are doing significant work in the area. These laboratories are primarily located in the United States, but some are in Europe and Australia, as well. As the field expands, so does the potential for abuse.  So far research has primarily been bankrolled by US government science and health funders like the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Health and Human Services. Private organizations like the Gates Foundation and academic institutions have also financed projects. Recently, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), sometimes thought of as the US military’s research and development wing, has gotten involved in the research. The University of California, Davis, for example, is working on a DARPA administered project called Prediction of Spillover Potential and Interventional En Masse Animal Vaccination to Prevent Emerging Pathogen Threats in Current and Future Zones of US Military Operation. According to a pamphlet, the project is “creating the world’s first prototype of a self-disseminating vaccine designed to induce a high level of herd immunity (wildlife population level protection) against Lassa virus … and Ebola.”  Military investment in biological innovation for defensive or protective purposes is permissible under the Biological Weapons Convention, but it can still send the wrong signals. It could cause countries to doubt one another’s intentions and lead to tit-for-tat investment in potentially risky research, including in self-spreading vaccines. The result of research gone awry or biowarfare could be catastrophic for health and the environment.  At a time when the norm against chemical weapons is degrading, underscored most recently by the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny with the nerve agent Novichok—a crime for which many European officials blame Russia—the international community simply can’t afford to have the same thing happen to the norm against the use of biological weapons. It would completely defy the spirit of the treaty if it seemed like states would even want to pursue high-risk dual use activities in biology.  Early, open, good-faith conversations about scientific aims and advances that cause particular dual-use concerns, as self-spreading vaccines do, are essential to exploring the broader stakes of certain technical trajectories. The University of California, Davis program is pursuing ways to incorporate an “off switch” to safely control the technology. And DARPA says any field experimentation related to the project would follow biosafety protocols. But these pledges won’t suffice. Our ambition must be to make a collective decision about the technical pathways we are willing, or not willing, to take as a society.",true/false
16,"Two weeks ago, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced he would be leading a delegation to the U.N. climate change summit in Scotland. Four days later, his office abruptly announced he had changed his mind.  “Family obligations” was all his office would say, refusing to publicly elaborate in a decision that, times being what they are, unleashed a barrage of conspiracy theories. Was the governor having a bad reaction to the Covid-19 booster shot he had just gotten? Were any of his children — he has four ages 12 and under — infected again with the coronavirus? No and no, Capitol sources said.  Allies of the governor noted that most parents would understand why a couple with four small children might not want to take an extended trip to Glasgow over Halloween. California environmentalists also suggested that he might not be so wrong to skip the annual climate conference, which many of them view as a jet-fuel-wasting spectacle.  In theory, California conservatives should also have welcomed the decision. When it appeared the governor might be summit-bound, Kevin Kiley, a Republican assemblyman who challenged the governor in the September recall election, wrote in a blog post that “in the absence of our jet-setting governor,” he was requesting a special session on the port crisis, holding oversight hearings on pandemic unemployment fraud, holding town hall events on the governor’s vaccine mandate for schoolchildren and calling for hearings on mask mandates in elementary school classrooms.",true/false

18,"Thank you to Universities UK UUK for hosting us today. In my first speech on universities a month ago, I addressed the subject of international education. I am proud of the sector’s international standing and reputation around the world. Today, I want to reflect further on what underpins this excellence, and what more we can do to enhance it. At the root of that success is the autonomy and academic freedom that enables us to attract brilliant people to work in and run our universities and lead our sectoral bodies. I’d like to congratulate Nicola Dandridge for her recent CBE and thank outgoing UUK President, Chris Snowden, for his excellent service. I would also like to congratulate Dame Julia Goodfellow on taking over the UUK Presidency – the first woman to hold the post ever, I believe in around 100 years of the existence of UUK and its predecessor body. Success of the sector The higher education sector can be proud of its success over the last 5 years and I want to pay tribute to my colleagues David Willetts and Greg Clark for their part in the reforms that have helped sustain the high esteem in which it is held around the world. We have seen: a transformed financial situation; as the OECD says, we are one of the only countries in the world to have found a way of sustainably funding higher education we have seen record numbers of young people entering higher education, including record numbers from disadvantaged backgrounds and we have seen record numbers of graduates in work; the recent Graduate Labour Market statistics showed the highest employment rate for working age graduates since 2007 at 87.5% through all this, the UK has retained its place as a world leader in HE , with 4 universities in the global top 10, and as number one in the world for the impact of our research Unfinished business It’s a great success story, but there is unfinished business and, in the coming months, my focus will be on implementing 3 key manifesto pledges, so that we consolidate and build on these achievements: firstly, lifting the cap on student numbers and widening participation, so that we remove barriers to ambition and meet the PM’s commitment to double the proportion of disadvantaged young people entering higher education by 2020 from 2009 levels secondly, delivering a teaching excellence framework that creates incentives for universities to devote as much attention to the quality of teaching as fee-paying students and prospective employers have a right to expect thirdly, driving value for money both for students investing in their education, and taxpayers underwriting the system, so that we ensure the continuing success and stability of these reforms Taking these points in reverse order. Meeting value for money expectations Around now, the first cohort of students to enter under the 2012 reforms is preparing to enter the labour market. They have been working hard for their final exams and made a significant investment in higher education. They are looking critically at what they get for that investment, and so must we, as a government, on behalf of taxpayers. I am concerned that recent surveys – the HEPI-HEA Student Academic Experience Survey, as well as a BBC/ComRes poll – showed that only around half of students felt their course had provided good value for money. All of us need to reflect on this and on what we can do to address such unease. More informed choices Thanks to the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act passed in March, we can now start to assess the employment and earnings returns to education by matching Department for Business, Innovation and Skills BIS and Department for Education DfE education data with HMRC employment and income data and Department for Work and Pensions DWP benefits data. Information of this sort will be incredibly useful for young people choosing courses or jobs that are most suitable for them. It will also enable education providers to assess their effectiveness in delivering positive labour market outcomes for their students. I am also pleased to see the piloting of new National Student Survey questions that measure the engagement of students with their course, staff and fellow students. This was shown in the US to be a good proxy for the value add of a university in terms of ‘learning gain’ - the improvement in knowledge, skills and work-readiness that students demonstrate over time. While independent learning is vital, universities must get used to providing clearer information about how many hours students will spend in lectures, seminars and tutorials, and who will deliver the teaching. Indeed the Competition and Markets Authority have advised higher education providers that information should be available to prospective students to meet the requirements of consumer law. I know this is already on the sector’s agenda. I will continue to push for more data to be made available, including for alternative providers. A Higher Education Policy Institute Hepi survey suggests as many as three-quarters of undergraduates want more information about where their fees go – and I sympathise with that. Such transparency looks to me like an essential way of addressing value for money concerns. More competition More competition will also be central to our efforts to drive up standards. In the last 3 years, we have seen more universities created than at any time since the 1992 expansion. We are committed to promoting high quality market entry, whilst at the same time ensuring a regulatory regime which guards against poor quality provision. More competition and more informed choice will help drive up value for money for both students and taxpayers. Graduate premium The graduate earnings premium is an important measure of the value universities add and of the greater productivity of those with skills acquired in higher education. Of course, many graduates will consciously choose to go into occupations that do not maximise their incomes – we must remember that education is about more than just wage returns. Indeed, that is the reason we have a progressive repayment system for student loans. But it is also important to remember that higher lifetime graduate earnings provide benefits to society – including higher tax revenues and faster and fuller repayment of student loans. Evidence of a decline in the graduate earnings premium is therefore a concern as we look to drive up productivity in the economy, secure our public finances and ensure our higher education system continues to be funded in a sustainable way. Between 2006 and 2015, the graduate earnings premium decreased from around 55% higher to around 45% higher than the earnings of non-graduates, with graduates now earning on average £31k and non-graduates £22,000. There is still a considerable benefit – but we cannot be complacent and must analyse why the premium employers pay for graduates is falling at a time when graduate-level skills are in growing demand. Course choice and curriculum design An important part of the answer is that we are not yet rising to the challenge of ensuring that enough young people are choosing courses where there are skills shortages and strong employer demand – notably in science, technology, engineering and mathematics STEM . Nor are we doing enough to ensure that all students emerge from university prepared for work. Last year’s CBI /Pearson Education and Skills survey suggested that 47% of employers felt universities should do more to help students become job-ready. Government, business and the university sector need to come together to address this mismatch between supply and demand in the graduate labour market. Businesses should not just be seen as customers of universities, recruiting the graduates they educate or buying research expertise, but as active partners. Universities need to develop business-outreach into a core function that has influence over curriculum design. Closer partnership between universities and business will help us tackle the misguided view that ‘more means worse’ and ensure that the investment both students and taxpayers make in higher education provides visible returns. Teaching Excellence Framework TEF Above all, to meet students’ high expectations of their university years and to deliver the skills our economy needs, we need a renewed focus on teaching. This is vital unfinished business from the reforms of the last Parliament. As David Willetts himself acknowledged in a recent interview with the Times Higher Education; “teaching has been by far the weakest aspect of English higher education”. This must change. There must be recognition of excellent teaching – and clear incentives to make ‘good’ teaching even better. Some rebalancing of the pull between teaching and research is undoubtedly required. It is striking that while we have a set of measures to reward high quality research, backed by substantial funding the Research Excellence Framework, there is nothing equivalent to drive up standards in teaching. That is why my priority as Universities Minister will be to make sure students get the teaching they deserve and employers get graduates with the skills they need by introducing the Teaching Excellence Framework we promised in our manifesto. Aims for the TEF My aims for the TEF are: to ensure all students receive an excellent teaching experience that encourages original thinking, drives up engagement and prepares them for the world of work to build a culture where teaching has equal status with research, with great teachers enjoying the same professional recognition and opportunities for career and pay progression as great researchers to stimulate a diverse HE market and provide students with the information they need to judge teaching quality – in the same way they can already compare a faculty’s research rating market and provide students with the information they need to judge teaching quality – in the same way they can already compare a faculty’s research rating to recognise those institutions that do the most to welcome students from a range of backgrounds and support their retention and progression to further study or a graduate job I expect the TEF to include a clear set of outcome-focused criteria and metrics. This should be underpinned by an external assessment process undertaken by an independent quality body from within the existing landscape. Believe me, I have no intention of replicating the individual and institutional burdens of the REF . I am clear that any external review must be proportionate and light touch, not big, bossy and bureaucratic. I want to work with you all, as well as with the Higher Education Funding Council for England and the Quality Assurance Agency, to design a framework that has widespread support and works for the sector, as well as students and employers and taxpayers. This is not happening in isolation. It goes with the grain of our reforms since 2010 and aims to accelerate positive changes already underway in the sector. We will be consulting widely and I am not pre-empting what any of the incentives might look like. I am keen to hear your views ahead of a green paper, which the Department of Business, Innovation and SkiIls plans to publish in the autumn. Maintaining the value of our degrees One of the things I want to focus on in the green paper is how the TEF can help improve the information that matters most for graduates and employers: the degree classification. Here we face a significant challenge. The UK’s standard model of classes of honours is on its own no longer capable of providing the recognition hardworking students deserve and the information employers require. Students across the country have just finished their exams and are looking for good graduate jobs. Last week’s High Fliers survey reminded us that the class of 2015 is more career-oriented than ever before. They rightly want hard work at university to be recognised and for their degree to be a currency that carries prestige and holds its value. At the same time, businesses need a degree classification system that will help them identify the best applicants for their firms. I know the sector is starting to tackle this need for richer information through the Higher Education Achievement Report and this is a valuable development, but this work needs greater urgency. Let me explain why: There has been a significant increase in the proportion of people receiving firsts and 2:1 degrees. To the extent this expansion in the number of firsts and 2:1s is to do with rising levels of attainment and hard work, I applaud it. But I suspect I am not alone in worrying that less benign forces are at work with the potential to damage the UK higher education brand. On the face of it, the facts are certainly startling. There has been a 300% increase in the percentage of firsts since the 1990s. Over 70% of graduates now get a First or 2:1 – up by 7 percentage points in the past 5 years. And compared to just 47% in the mid-1990s. In 2013 to 14, over 50% of students were awarded an upper second, suggesting that this grade band not only disguises considerable variation in attainment, but also permits some to coast. The Higher Education Academy found that nearly half of institutions had changed their degree algorithms to; “ensure that their students were not disadvantaged compared to those in other institutions”. The Teaching Excellence Framework we will introduce will include incentives for the sector to tackle degree inflation and ensure that hard-won qualifications hold their value. I want the green paper to look at the role that external examiners play in underpinning standards and ensuring our grading system provides a clearer, more comparable picture of student attainment. Stronger student engagement I also want to make sure that the Teaching Excellence Framework encourages universities to adopt a grading system that does more to motivate and engage students throughout their course. The familiar pattern of a First, 2:1 and 2:2, Third is widely recognised. But providing extra granularity through a grade point average GPA – a 13 point scale developed by the sector – will encourage consistent effort, make it less easy to coast within the 2:1 band and give employers more information about candidates within that classification. It is vital that we continue to drive up student engagement. Students are working harder than before and that is a welcome trend, which we want to support through the Teaching Excellence Framework. But many full time students are still not being sufficiently stretched. In the most recent Student Academic Experience Survey, the total weekly workload reported by students averages 30.5 hours, including 14 hours of independent study, and varies greatly by subject. The reported weekly workload on courses such as Mass Communications and Documentation is as little as 22 hours. Students are telling us in surveys that they know they would do better by investing more time in their studies. As a more finely-calibrated long-run batting average, GPA should drive greater student engagement than our present system, which, notwithstanding more summative coursework, in many ways can still look like a snapshot performance measure. I know Sir Robert Burgess, chair of the Grade Point Average Advisory Group, has predicted all UK universities will adopt the model by the end of the decade. I support this goal and want the green paper to examine how the new Teaching Excellence Framework can encourage universities to adopt dual running of the GPA and honours degree system, as recommended in the recent Higher Education Academy report. Widening participation My focus has of course been on students and the job market. But this does not mean we overlook the value of learning for its own sake, or the role of higher education in social mobility. The 2012 reforms mean that anyone with the ability can now make going to university their goal, a fact underscored by our decision to lift the cap on student numbers altogether from this academic year. Anyone with potential to benefit from university should not be prevented from going because of their background or ability to pay. But of course there is still more to do. The Prime Minister has set an ambitious goal to double the proportion of those from disadvantaged backgrounds progressing into higher education by 2020 compared with 2009. I will challenge you to do all you can to reach this target. That’s why I am delighted that Professor Les Ebdon has agreed to extend his term as director of the Office of Fair Access to help us fulfil a commitment that is central to this One Nation Government’s aim to promote social mobility in this country. In particular, I want to see more progress being made in the most selective institutions. Data from UCAS shows the clear progress that the sector has made, and I applaud that. I want to see more outreach and more innovation in terms of course length and design. Degree Apprenticeships and 2-year courses in particular offer a more accessible route to a higher education and a faster path to productive employment. We also need to match our efforts on driving up fair access by also ensuring those young people succeed in getting a good qualification and have an opportunity to find a fulfilling career. I know that this ‘whole student lifecycle’ approach is one that you are taking seriously – and it is embedded in the National Strategy for Access and Student Success. I expect our new Teaching Excellence Framework to include incentives that reward institutions who do best at retention and progression of disadvantaged students through their college years. Conclusion I recognise that this is a challenging agenda and that you are already focused on many of these issues. We will be working with closely with universities and with the grain of reforms that have put power and choice in the hands of students. Those institutions that can demonstrate that they excel in teaching and in supporting all students – including those from disadvantaged backgrounds – through university into graduate jobs will reap rewards. If we can get this right – on driving value for money for students and taxpayers on creating incentives to encourage excellent teaching and on widening participation – then I’m confident we can together make a world-leading higher education sector greater still.",true/false
19,"New federal guidelines prompted by a surge in coronavirus cases have left school leaders across the country embroiled in debates over whether to require masks in schools, muddling a long-sought return to normalcy for millions of children. The wrangling over masks, considered by pediatricians and epidemiologists to be one of the most effective ways to stop school spread, has turned deeply personal and political, fueling vitriol at school board meetings that have left board members fearing for their safety. Several Republican-led states have barred school districts from requiring masks, threatening to fine school leaders or cut state funding if they attempt it. Caught in the fray are school leaders, who are forced to again navigate constantly shifting pandemic conditions, conflicting guidance on how to manage them and political fights — all while trying to craft policies that will keep students safe and buildings open. Because despite the deep divide over masks, there is a virtual consensus that it is critical to get children back to face-to-face learning. Advertisement “Politics play into it,” Dan Nerelli, superintendent of the Chichester School District outside Philadelphia, said of the national climate. In his district, masks were optional during the summer and no decision has been made yet on the fall. “People don’t want to say it, but it’s a hot topic, and as superintendents we get caught in the middle of it.” Biden presses federal workers to get vaccinated, with new testing, masking and distancing rules for those who refuse Nearly everyone agrees that children should be back in classrooms, a goal that is now being threatened by the delta variant and the mask debate. Parents in both camps — those who support mask mandates and those who oppose them — are pulling their children from brick-and-mortar schools in districts where they disagree with masking policies. A rash of cases among students and staffers in the Ash Fork School District in Arizona, which opened its doors last week for the new school year, forced the school system to close buildings Wednesday. In a video, Superintendent Seth Staples pleaded with parents for patience. He noted, too, that while masks were recommended, the state barred him from requiring them. Advertisement A spike in coronavirus cases — and a critical shortage of hospital beds — pushed Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) to declare a state of emergency and to call the legislature back in to session to reconsider the state’s ban on mask mandates. On Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance urging everyone in school buildings to wear masks, regardless of vaccination status, a response to growing concerns over the highly contagious delta variant. That was a shift from guidance issued just three weeks prior, when the agency said only unvaccinated people in school buildings needed masks. CDC changes course on school guidance, advising everyone to wear masks Several school districts, including in New Orleans and Georgia’s Gwinnett County, took heed and will require universal masking in schools for the coming school year. GOP leaders balked. “This is just another example of the Biden-Harris administration’s inability to effectively confront the COVID-19 pandemic,” Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) said in a statement. Ducey, who banned schools from implementing mask mandates and then helped make it state law, said that requiring masks even for the vaccinated would lead people to wrongly believe that vaccine is not effective. Advertisement The fights over mask mandates and other pandemic adjustments have taken a scary turn in some school districts. Paul Imhoff, who is president of a nationwide association for school superintendents and heads the Upper Arlington school district in Ohio, said some of his colleagues have told him that they have stationed armed security guards outside their homes, worried that rancor will turn into violence. Ducey is one of several GOP governors who have backed efforts to ban or discourage school leaders from implementing mask mandates, saying they want to leave decisions about masking up to parents. Their actions have drawn criticism from those who say they are ignoring public health guidance in order to play to their base of supporters. CDC urges vaccinated people in covid hot spots to resume wearing masks indoors Some opponents of mask mandates rely on fringe science to back their claims that masks are ineffective. Others say that they are concerned masks will leave children traumatized and impede their learning and that the disease poses little threat to children — though they can still spread it to adults. Advertisement And many argue that the public health guidelines infringe on their personal liberty. John Kuhn, superintendent of the small, rural Mineral Wells Independent School District in Texas, said he understands why some parents oppose mask mandates. There are those who oppose any pandemic restrictions and worry they will again lead to a full-scale shutdown, even though public health officials have said the opposite — that mask-wearing could prevent shutdowns. “Will covid-19 spread more readily if government doesn’t require masks? Yes. Is it dangerous? Yes. I don’t think school people are ignorant of these realities or deny them,” Kuhn said. “There are no easy answers here. Basically, a school’s masking policy has to reflect its community’s masking expectations.” In states where mask mandates have been banned, it means local school leaders have to choose between breaking the law or ignoring CDC guidelines. Texas has threatened school leaders with fines if they attempt to implement mask requirements, and in Arizona and South Carolina, schools can lose state funding if they defy the bans. Advertisement In Austin, where Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) issued an executive order banning mask mandates, school leaders are preparing to accommodate children whose parents will not send them to school alongside unmasked students and staffers. The Austin Independent School District recently expanded its virtual offerings, even though the state is not paying for it. “We know that masks work, and kids were great at wearing masks,” said Jason Stanford, spokesman for the school district. “We would absolutely be mandating masks if we were allowed to.” In Florida, where cases of the delta variant are rising sharply, a showdown appears to be looming between Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), a staunch opponent of mask mandates, and at least one school district that this week reversed its fall mask-optional policy, opting to require masks for all. Advertisement “There is no way in good conscience that I could bring anybody back into the school environment, on the bus, the cafeteria, and not have a mask mandate,” said Rosalind Osgood, chair of the Broward County School Board. Opponents of the mask mandate had gathered at the school board meeting Tuesday, burning masks. The board was forced to adjourn early because they refused to wear masks inside the building, CBS4 in Miami reported. On Wednesday, opponents arrived armed with what they said was evidence that masks do not work. One mother lifted her young daughter to the microphone to address the members. “I don’t want to wear it, because I can’t breath,” she said. In Iowa City, parents asked the school district to educate masked and unmasked students separately, since the state barred it from passing a mask mandate. “The parents, rightly so, are trying to find clever ways to work around the laws and still keep their kids safe,” said Shawn Eyestone, president of the school board. “But the problem is, logistically, it’s almost impossible.” Advertisement The debate has also illuminated a stark racial divide in the pandemic. Anti-mask protesters in many places are mostly White. In large urban districts and majority-Black districts, the mask mandates have been largely uncontroversial. It’s a contrast that has been reflected in polls. In May, more than three-quarters of Black, Hispanic and Asian parents said they needed mask requirements to feel safe sending their children back in to classrooms, compared with 53 percent of White parents, according to research done by the Rand Corp. New York, Chicago and Los Angeles never lifted their universal masking requirements. And when Clayton County, Ga., outside Atlanta, decided to expand its mask mandate, school leaders heard little fuss. “Many of our families are front-line workers. [Our community] was hit very hard,” Superintendent Morcease Beasley said. “That has contributed to us here in Clayton County hearing little pushback, because those families have experienced the impact of this pandemic firsthand.”",true/false
20,"(CNN) The White House's nominee for a top Pentagon post repeatedly spread conspiracy theories that a former CIA director tried to overthrow President Donald Trump and even have him assassinated in newly discovered comments from radio and television appearances as well as on social media.  Retired Army Brig. Gen. Anthony Tata, who was nominated to become the under secretary of defense for policy at the Department of Defense, promoted conspiracy theories that John Brennan, the former CIA director, wanted to oust Trump from office, and pushed a bogus conspiracy theory that Brennan sent a coded tweet to order the assassination of Trump in 2018.  A spokesperson for Brennan declined to comment.  CNN's KFile reviewed dozens of Tata's radio and television appearances and found that he also spread conspiracy theories that a ""deep state cabal"" of officials would rather see Trump fail than succeed in office, a sentiment echoed by the President and his allies, using extreme rhetoric. Tata also said then-President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama engaged in ""borderline treasonous"" behavior by expressing their dismay over a Trump presidency during the transition period.  The retired general's nomination to the third-highest position at the Pentagon faces jeopardy after Democratic senators spoke out against his nomination following CNN's KFile reporting last week on Tata's history of Islamophobia and derogatory comments and tweets, including falsely calling Obama a Muslim and ""terrorist leader."" At least two high-profile retired generals have pulled their support for Tata since his tweets were reported. Tata has since deleted dozens of his tweets, screenshots of which were captured by CNN.  CNN obtained a letter Tata sent to the top members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Republican Chairman Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma and Democrat Jack Reed of Rhode Island, both of whom oversee his nomination, apologizing for his past Islamophobic tweets. He wrote, ""I deeply regret comments I made on social media several years ago"" and that ""my tweets were completely out of character.""  ""My regret, however, has nothing to do with my nomination for Undersecretary of Defense of Policy. Rather, I have a lifetime of public service leadership and a cadre of soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and civilian mentors and protégés whom I disappointed with those comments,"" Tata added in his letter, first reported on Saturday by The Hill  If confirmed by the Senate, Tata would oversee the Pentagon's policy on everything from Afghanistan, China, Iran and Russia to nuclear deterrence and missile defense policy. He would also closely advise the secretary of defense on national security and support the Pentagon's program and budget decisions.  Tata's nomination comes as the White House seeks to install loyalists to key positions throughout the administration. His newly surfaced comments appear to mimic what the President and his allies have long maintained -- that the ""deep state"" has sought to undermine Trump's presidency and that his opponents would rather see the country fail than see him succeed -- without citing specific evidence.  The retired general also said that Obama's foreign policy ""was born of the Jeremiah Wright school of hate America"" and that the former president held a ""Weather Underground"" philosophy, referring respectively to the Obamas' former pastor and to the FBI-designated domestic terrorist group born out of anti-war sentiments that bombed dozens of buildings and government institutions in the 1960s and 1970s.  The Pentagon referred CNN to the White House for comment. The White House stood by Tata and referred CNN to a previous statement defending the nominee from last week  ""Anthony Tata, the President's exceptionally qualified nominee for Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, is a distinguished public servant whose career has provided him with planning, policy, and operational experience both at home and abroad,"" White House spokesman Judd Deere told CNN in an email. ""His education, background, and record has earned him bi-partisan praise, and this attempt by the media to slander his reputation is disgusting. The White House stands by the President's qualified nominee.""  Tata did not respond for comment but, a source familiar with the discussions regarding Tata's nomination told CNN that Tata is ""pleased with the support he's receiving from the White House and DOD teams and hopes to speak members of both parties as soon as possible.""  ""He intends to convey in person or by phone his sincere regret for his past comments and hopes to discuss the serious policy concerns the US faces today,"" the source said.  A US defense official confirmed that Tata still works as a senior adviser in the Pentagon.  Tata spread conspiracy theories that officials were trying to overthrow and assassinate Trump  Tata asserted a number of conspiracy theories in his radio and television appearances and on social media. In several media appearances, Tata attacked Brennan, the former director of the CIA in the Obama administration, as a ""former communist"" who ""manipulated ISIS intelligence"" for Obama on a 2016 podcast  After Trump revoked Brennan's security clearance in August 2018, Tata told Fox News , ""I think that John Brennan is a clear and present danger and a threat to this nation. He supports the overthrow of this particular president and he needed to have his access to information revoked.""  ""It would not surprise me if eventually it came out that he was somehow allied with some foreign power because what he's doing is fomenting the division. You look at his tweets, you look at what he says, and he is doing Putin's bidding every day on Twitter. He is dividing this nation and he's trying to ossify the left against the right,"" said Tata.  Tata went further in a May 2018 tweet when he pushed a conspiracy theory of his own by claiming that Brennan used a coded tweet to order the assassination of Trump. After Brennan tweeted a Cicero quote, Tata replied, ""As incompetent as @JohnBrennan was as a #CIA analyst (failure at Khobar Towers), we must assume he knows spy tradecraft. This is a signal to someone, somewhere. Cicero was assassinated for political reasons. This is a clear threat against @POTUS.""  When a Twitter user challenged if Tata was serious about his accusation, Tata replied , ""Totally. He's nervous. He ran the CIA. He's committed multiple crimes. He has the network to do what he threatens here.""  The Twitter user then asked the retired general if Brennan's tweet was a signal to someone to assassinate the President. Tata wrote back , ""I believe so. Why else would he randomly quote Cicero on a day that @realDonaldTrump asks for an investigation of crimes that directly implicates him? Serious crimes: treason, sedition. He's a cowardly bureaucrat that lucked into a powerful psn. He doesn't have the spine for this.""  In a now deleted tweet, Tata also used the hashtag ""Clinton Body Count"" to refer to the conspiracy that former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have ordered the assassinations of their associates, and wrote that he hoped former FBI lawyer Lisa Page did not meet an ""untimely demise.""  Tata also accused the Obamas of engaging in ""borderline treasonous"" behavior during the presidential transition period from Obama to Trump after they expressed dismay at a Trump presidency.  ""So when you see President Obama on Comedy Central, digging on the President-elect, making fun of him and talking about Russia. And you hear Michelle Obama on the Oprah show saying for the first time in her life, she's felt no hope--that is unconscionable. That is, that is a borderline treasonous to be undermining the term, a peaceful transition of power,"" said Tata on a December 2016 podcast  He also claimed Obama was an insurgent who tried to undermine and overthrow American life in another broadcast from December 2016.  ""He had the Jeremiah Wright philosophy. He had the Weather Underground philosophy. And so he had all the insurgent philosophy of how to undermine American values and American way of life and American foreign policy, which he is effectively done,"" Tata said, referring to the Weather Underground Organization, a radical militant group responsible for bombings and other acts of political violence in the 1960s and 1970s. The FBI designated the organization as a domestic terrorist organization.  Tata also maintained that opponents of Trump would rather see the President fail than succeed, often using extreme rhetoric. In 2018 Tata said , ""I believe in my soul that Hillary Clinton and others would prefer to see a nuclear cloud over America than to see Donald Trump succeed. I mean that 100%.""  ""That we are so divided right now that the left wants to, would rather see the country burned down, than to have this President succeed,"" he added.",true/false
21,"The name of the 21-year-old suspect, who is in custody, was released at a news conference by Boulder Police Chief Maris Herold, who did not disclose a possible motive for Monday's bloodshed.  A search of the suspect's suburban Denver home turned up other weapons, a senior law enforcement source said Tuesday. The weapon used in the attack was an AR-15-style pistol modified with an arm brace, according to the source.  Authorities have said they believe Alissa was the only person involved and that there was no additional threat to the community.  The suspect has been charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and one charge of attempted murder, according to his arrest warrant. His first court appearance is scheduled for 8:15 a.m. (10:15 a.m. ET) Thursday, according to Colorado Judicial Branch online records.  The warrant described Alissa as being armed with either an assault rifle or ""black AR-15"" and wearing a ""tactical"" or ""armored"" vest. A senior law enforcement source told CNN on condition of anonymity the shooter used a Ruger AR-556 pistol, modified with an arm brace, and was also carrying a 9 mm handgun, according to the source.  The Boulder Police Department released the booking photograph of suspected gunman Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa.  The suspect had ""removed all of his clothing and was dressed only in shorts"" when he was taken into custody, the affidavit said. Outside the store, the document said, Alissa wouldn't tell police whether there were other suspects, but he did ask to speak to his mother.  Using law enforcement databases, the affidavit said, investigators determined Alissa had purchased a Ruger AR556 pistol on March 16.A law enforcement official told CNN Alissa was not previously the subject of any FBI investigation and said it appears nothing in the federal system would have prohibited Alissa from buying a firearm.  Michael Dougherty, Boulder County district attorney, said Alissa is a resident of Arvada, between Boulder and Denver, who has ""lived most of his life in the United States.""  Brother says he believes suspect was 'paranoid'  Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa was taken into custody after the mass shooting.  Alissa, whose family emigrated from Syria, may have been suffering from mental illness, according to his 34-year-old brother, Ali Aliwi Alissa.  The brother told CNN on Tuesday that in high school bullies made fun of Alissa's name and for being Muslim and that may have contributed to him becoming ""anti-social.""  ""People chose not to mess with him because of his temper, people chose not to really talk to him because of all -- how he acted and things like that. So yeah, he was very alone,"" said Damien Cruz, who said he has known Alissa since the fifth grade.  Alissa had become increasingly ""paranoid"" around 2014, believing he was being followed and chased, according to his brother. At one point, the young man covered the camera on his computer with duct tape so he could not be seen, said the brother, who lives with Alissa.  ""He always suspected someone was behind him, someone was chasing him,"" Ali Alissa said.  ""We kept a close eye on him when he was in high school. He would say, 'Someone is chasing me, someone is investigating me.' And we're like, 'Come on man. There's nothing.' ... He was just closing into himself,"" the brother added.  Alissa's Facebook page, the authenticity of which was confirmed by his brother and a high school classmate, shows posts saying he believed his former high school had been hacking into his phone.  ""Just curious what are the laws about phone privacy because I believe my old school (a west) was hacking my phone,"" Alissa wrote in a March 18, 2019, Facebook post.  He made a second post on July 5, 2019, also claiming that people were hacking his phone, saying, ""let me have a normal life I probably could.""  When his Facebook friends questioned how he knew the school was hacking his phone, Alissa said: ""I believe part racism for sure. But I also believe someone spread rumors about me which are false and maybe that set it off.""  The profile claims Alissa attended Arvada West High School. Cameron Bell, Jefferson County Public Schools spokesperson, confirmed Alissa was a student there from March 2015 until he graduated in May 2018.  Alissa was not very political or particularly religious, according to his brother, who said he never heard the young man threaten to use violence.  ""The entire thing surprised me,"" Ali Alissa said of the Monday's shootings. ""I never ever would have thought he would do such a thing. I never thought he would kill. I still can't believe it. I am really sad for the lives that he wasted, and I feel sorry for all those families. ... We lost a brother even if he is the killer.""  Aside from a knife he used for cooking, Ali Alissa said he did not know his brother to carry any weapon, including a firearm.  Sister-in-law says she saw suspect playing with a gun  According to the arrest warrant, a woman identified as the suspect's sister-in-law ""stated that (Ahmad Al Aliwi) Alissa was seen playing with a gun she thought looked like a 'machine gun' about 2 days ago. She did not believe the gun looked like the rifles she has seen in old Western movies. . . . Alissa had been talking about having a bullet stuck in the gun and was playing with the gun.""  The woman's name was redacted from the document.  Ali Alissa said he doesn't know why his brother went to King Soopers on Monday. Police interrogated him and another brother, according to Ali Alissa, who said authorities searched their home in the predawn hours Tuesday.  ""They searched every corner,"" he said, ""every piece of clothing.""  The family emigrated from Syria in 2002, the brother said. They have lived in the Arvada area since 2014.  Facebook has shut down Facebook and Instagram accounts belonging to the suspect, a company spokesperson said Tuesday.  Alissa was found guilty of assault in 2018  Alissa was sentenced to one year probation and 48 hours of community service after being found guilty of third-degree assault in 2018 for an incident that occurred the previous November, according to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation's database.  The case stemmed from a incident in which a then-18-year-old Alissa was accused of attacking a classmate at Arvada West High School.  A report from a police officer included in the case file says Alissa ""got up in (a) classroom, walked over to (the) victim & 'cold-cocked' him in the head.""  Alissa ""got on top of (the victim) & punched him in (the) head several more times,"" the report says, adding that the victim ""had bruising, swelling & cuts to (the) head, as well as pain.""  ""No witnesses could see or hear any reason"" for the attack, and Alissa said the victim ""had made fun of him & called him racial names weeks earlier,"" the officer wrote.  Shooting comes 1 week after Atlanta massacre  The mass shooting suspect has made statements to investigators, Dougherty said.  ""We're collecting those statements now and we'll be providing those in the weeks ahead,"" Dougherty said.  Herold said the suspect was wounded in the leg during ""an exchange of gunfire.""  The suspect was taken into custody about 3:30 p.m. Monday and transported to a hospital, where he was in stable condition.  He was booked into Boulder County Jail early Tuesday afternoon, according to the jail's records.  The massacre at the King Soopers store occurred less than a week after shootings at three spas in the Atlanta area left eight people dead. In the past week in the US, there have been at least seven shootings in which at least four people were injured or killed.  The slain Boulder officer, 51-year-old Eric Talley, was the first to respond to the scene, according to Herold. Talley had joined the force in 2010, she said.  The victims were ordinary Coloradans going about their daily lives -- picking up groceries, waiting in line for a coronavirus vaccine. They ranged from 20 to 65 years old.",true/false
22,"Milwaukee emerged as America's fourth-most impoverished big city in 2009, as the Great Recession rippled across the city and state, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures released Tuesday. Milwaukee's poverty rate reached 27%, up from 23.4% in the previous year. Only Detroit (36.4%), Cleveland (35%) and Buffalo (28.8%) had higher poverty rates among cities with populations greater than 250,000. Milwaukee was ranked 11th in 2008. An estimated 158,245 Milwaukeeans lived in poverty last year. For a family of four with two adults and two children, the poverty threshold was an annual income of $21,954. What's more, nearly 4 in 10 children in Milwaukee were considered poor, meaning an estimated 62,432 children lived in poverty last year, up from 49,952 in 2008. Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, a Democrat who is running for governor, said the poverty numbers ""are unacceptable and should be of concern to everyone in the community and the state."" ""They obviously are in part a result of the global economic downturn which has disproportionately affected lower incomes,"" he said. ""But it has also sent lower middle-class people into poverty as well. It explains why we're looking so aggressive to create more jobs, tackle the issues of education, workforce development and transportation."" Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker, the Republican candidate for governor, said the ""anti-business"" policies of Democrats Barrett and sitting governor Jim Doyle have directly affected ""the poverty levels in Milwaukee and cities across our state."" ""As governor, I'll work to get government out of the way so we can help struggling families and bring 250,000 jobs to Wisconsin,"" Walker said in a statement. Barrett disputed Walker's assertion and said, ""I have never seen any signs that he is interested in addressing the poverty issues in our community, period."" He said that jobs provide the best remedy for alleviating poverty and added that he would prefer the issue not be politicized. ""I wish this is one (issue) we could reach across the aisle and work together,"" Barrett said. Michael Bonds, president of the Milwaukee School Board, said he was not surprised by the newest poverty figures. ""I think we're at a critical point when we're starting to see some of the broader things in the community impacting students,"" he said. ""Not only do schools have to deal with traditional education, but now they also have to provide supports that were traditionally provided by other agencies, because those institutions are also facing financial challenges,"" he added. Bonds said he doesn't see any quick-fix to bring children out of poverty in Milwaukee. ""Some areas of the city, you see African-American unemployment reaching 60% to 70%,"" he said. Marc Levine, executive director of the Center for Economic Development at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, said the latest census data reflect the city's lack of job growth. ""Our analysis of employment data shows that Milwaukee has had among the worst job creation records of any big city in the U.S. for over a decade, so it is not surprising that poverty numbers have worsened, especially during the worst recession since the Great Depression,"" Levine said. Hard times didn't hit just in Milwaukee. Real median household income in the state declined between 2008 and 2009 - decreasing by 3.8% from $51,942 to $49,993. Poverty also surged statewide from 10.4% to 12.4% in 2009. There were an estimated 570,583 people in poverty in the state in 2008 and 683,408 people in poverty in 2009. Nationally, poverty increased from 38.3 million people in 2008 to 42.8 million in 2009. Ken Taylor, executive director of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, labeled the poverty numbers as ""brutal"" and said they ""confirm our worst fears about the reality of the recession on kids."" ""The idea that what happens in Milwaukee doesn't influence Ozaukee County is a fallacy,"" he said. ""We're all affected across the state by the challenges in Milwaukee."" In the suburbs outside Milwaukee, the poverty rates were much lower, led by Waukesha County (4.8%) while Ozaukee (5.3%) and Washington (5.4%) counties were not much higher. The poverty rates in those counties all increased at least 1 percentage point. The results come from the American Community Survey, which provides a snapshot of the nation's socioeconomic, housing and demographic characteristics. Later this year, the Census Bureau will release the first results from the 2010 Census, the complete count of every person in the country.

23,"WASHINGTON, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, August 30, 2021 — Dr. Robin R. Ganzert, president and CEO of American Humane, the country’s first national humane organization, today released the following statement concerning the plight of contract working dogs left to die at the hands of American enemies in Kabul, Afghanistan.  “I am devastated by reports that the American government is pulling out of Kabul and leaving behind brave U.S. military contract working dogs to be tortured and killed at the hand of our enemies. These brave dogs do the same dangerous, lifesaving work as our military working dogs, and deserved a far better fate than the one to which they have been condemned.  This senseless fate is made all the more tragic, as American Humane stands ready to not only help transport these contract K-9 soldiers to U.S. soil but also to provide for their lifetime medical care.  American Humane has worked hand in hand with the military for more than 100 years to rescue military animals. In fact, our famed rescue program began on the bloody battlefields of WWI Europe, at the request of the U.S. Secretary of War. Since that time, American Humane served as a pioneer in the development of animal therapy for returning veterans, and today brings home retired military working dogs and pairs veterans with life-saving service dogs.  As the country’s first national humane organization and largest certifier of animal welfare in the world, it sickens us to sit idly by and watch these brave dogs who valiantly served our country be put to death or worse.  In order to prevent this tragedy from occurring, these K-9’s should be loaded into whatever cargo space remains and flown to safety.  Irrespective of the outcome, this gross oversight of justice must be stopped from happening again, as it did in Vietnam too. To that end, we call on Congress to take action to classify contract working dogs on the same level as military working dogs. Failure to do anything less, is a failure of humanity and a condemnation of us all.”",true/false
24,"A promising Australian candidate for a coronavirus vaccine has been abandoned after trial participants returned false HIV positive results. Australia had previously agreed to buy 51 million doses of the vaccine being developed by Australian firm CSL and the University of Queensland (UQ). The government said orders of other vaccines would now fill the shortfall. CSL and UQ stressed that the positive results were false - meaning trial participants' health was not at risk. The Australian government said it had now entered an agreement for the Novavax vaccine, and upped its existing order of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. The UK was the first to begin rolling out a vaccine from Pfizer this week.What happened with the UQ/CSL vaccine? The vaccine had been in stage one of trials, and proving to be effective in making antibodies. But it also generated HIV antibodies in some recipients - which meant it showed false positives for HIV. Further testing proved the HIV wasn't there. CSL and UQ said fixing the flaw would take about a year, prompting a decision to abandon the trial. ""It was likely to work. But we knew that we didn't want to have any issues with confidence, and this false-positive test may have caused some confusion and lack of confidence,"" said Brendan Murphy, secretary of Australia's Department of Health.Vaccine co-lead Paul Young described the decision as ""devastating"" after 11 months of ""living and breathing this project"". ""While this is a tough decision to take, the urgent need for a vaccine has to be everyone's priority,"" he said. Other medical experts have also praised the ""realistic"" decision to abandon the UQ vaccine, saying it reflects the reality of vaccine development. ""In general, about 90% of vaccines never make it to market. As a global community, we have been spoilt with the unprecedented swiftness and success with which the development of Covid-19 vaccines have taken place,"" said infectious diseases expert Sanjaya Senanayake from the Australian National University. What does it mean for Australia? Australia has all but eliminated community transmission of the virus, after getting on top of outbreaks in recent months. Prof Murphy said the nation was in a ""wonderful position"" at present, but there would be ""full population coverage"" from two vaccines in 2021. ""We don't need emergency approval - we're in a good position because we've controlled the virus,"" he said on Friday. ""So I'm very confident about the successful vaccination strategy that we'll be facing next year."" The government said it had prepared for this sort of situation and as such had ""spread the risk"" with multiple deals for vaccines. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said focusing Australia's manufacturing efforts on the other vaccines would mean ""we are more likely to have the entire population vaccinated earlier rather than later"". The Oxford vaccine has been found to be ""safe and effective"", according to researchers, but is awaiting approval from regulators around the world. Early 2021 is still listed as when the first vaccines - most likely from Oxford/AstraZeneca - are scheduled to be given to Australians. Australia has a population of 25 million people. It recorded just one case of local transmission in the past week. The nation has reported 908 deaths and 28,000 cases so far during the pandemic - far fewer than many nations. It has been praised for responding quickly to the pandemic with border shutdowns, lockdown measures and aggressive contract-tracing efforts. Some failures, however, have been blamed for deaths. Victoria crushed the country's worst outbreak after four months of a severe lockdown in the state capital, Melbourne.",true/false
25,"Last week Johnson gave his strongest hint yet that the final stage of easing restrictions, originally set for June 21, might be delayed  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday announced a four-week delay to the full lifting of coronavirus restrictions in England due to a surge in infections caused by the Delta variant.  The delay comes as a blow to Johnson's plans to fully reopen the UK economy on June 21 after months of gradually easing restrictions since March.  Newspapers had been counting down to what had been dubbed ""Freedom Day"", which was set to mark an end to all social distancing restrictions and the reopening of nightclubs.  But Johnson said a sharp rise in infections had prompted a decision to ""ease off the accelerator"" and focus instead on ramping up vaccinations.  ""On the evidence I can see right now, I'm confident that we will not need more than four weeks and won't need to go beyond July 19,"" Johnson told a press briefing.  Health policy is devolved in the four nations that make up the UK, handled separately in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Scotland, which was due to move to the lowest level of restrictions on June 28, is also expected to announce a delay to its reopening.  In England, most current rules -- including limits on the number of people who can meet in pubs and restaurants -- will remain in place until July 19, although restrictions on the number of guests allowed at weddings will be lifted.  Large scale pilot events, such as Euro 2020 football matches, will also go ahead as planned.  The more transmissible Delta variant, first identified in India, is now responsible for 96 percent of UK cases, and positive tests have jumped 50 percent in the last week.  Total reported cases are now at their highest since February -- around 8,000 new infections a day.  The Delta variant is believed to be around 60 percent more transmissible than the Alpha variant first identified in Kent, southeast England.  That strain forced the country to go into another three-month lockdown in January.  Nevertheless hospital admissions and deaths remain low, thanks in large part to Britain's rapid vaccination rollout.  Story continues  More than 55 percent of adults in the UK have had two vaccine jabs.  - Vaccine boost -  Newspapers have hinted at dissent within Johnson's cabinet over the delay, with The Times citing an unnamed minister as saying it was ""a very odd decision"".  Johnson accepted that ""we cannot simply eliminate Covid, we must learn to live with it,"" but added that ""once the adults of this country have been overwhelmingly vaccinated... we will be in a far stronger position to... live with this disease"".  The government hopes that two thirds of all adults will have received two shots by July 19.  A study released Monday found that two jabs of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine stopped the need for in-patient treatment in 96 percent of cases of the new variant.  With a double dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca shot, the rate was 92 percent.  The government had hoped to allow crowds to return unrestricted to pubs and clubs next week, with the hard-hit hospitality industry warning it is on its last legs.  Trade association UKHospitality estimated that a month's delay in lifting the restrictions would cost the sector around £3 billion ($4.23 billion) in sales.  ""A full and final ending of restrictions is the only way to ensure that businesses in this sector can trade profitably,"" said its chief executive Kate Nicholls.  imm-am/jwp/kjl",true/false
26,"The NRS said the three deaths should be considered in the context of the millions of first doses that have been administered in Scotland Three ""extremely rare"" deaths in Scotland have been linked to adverse effects from Covid-19 vaccines. National Records of Scotland (NRS) said the effects had been recorded as the ""underlying cause"" in each of the three deaths, which were before 30 April. More than 2.8 million people had received at least a first dose of the vaccine by that date. Public health expert Prof Linda Bauld said the ""vast, vast majority"" of Covid vaccine side effects were very mild. The professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh told BBC Scotland that serious adverse effects from any vaccine were extremely unusual. ""The vast, vast majority of side effects from the Covid vaccines are very mild. You do have severe cases, but only very rarely,"" she said. ""We have been aware of the rare blood clots that we think are linked to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine... but it's not always possible to say the vaccine caused it. There may be other contributory factors."" 'Best' protection against Covid The Scottish government said it was ""important to be cautious"" when drawing conclusions from associations between vaccinations and deaths. ""All medicines, including vaccinations, can have side effects but serious adverse events and deaths are very rare with Covid vaccines,"" a spokesperson said. ""Over three million first doses of Covid vaccines have been administered in Scotland, and only a very small number of people are thought to have died. However, our thoughts and sympathies are always with those few affected, and their families."" The spokesperson added that vaccines remained the ""best way"" to protect people from Covid-19 and had already saved thousands of lives. Three Covid-19 vaccines - Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna - are currently being used in the UK. All have been authorised for supply by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The vaccines are known to cause a number of mild side effects like a sore arm or headache. In April, the MHPRA confirmed that seven people had died from unusual blood clots after getting the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK, but it was not clear if this was a coincidence or side effect from the vaccine. In total, 30 people out of 18 million vaccinated in the UK by 24 March had these clots and the regulator said the benefits of the vaccine continued to outweigh the risks.The latest monthly figures from the NRS reported that 10,109 deaths have been registered where Covid was mentioned on the death certificate. Six deaths were registered between 10 May and 16 May, a decrease of one death from the previous week. The figures also show that post Covid-19 conditions - including ""long Covid"" - were mentioned on 11 death certificates in the period from March 2020 to April 2021. Pete Whitehouse, the NRS director of statistical services, said: ""Last week there were no registered Covid-19 deaths in 29 of Scotland's 32 council areas. Across Scotland, six Covid-19 deaths were registered which is the lowest number since early September last year. ""The report also shows that deaths from Covid-19 continues to have a greater impact on people living in Scotland's more deprived communities. ""Over the course of the pandemic, people living in these most deprived areas are 2.4 times as likely to die with Covid-19 than those living in the least deprived areas after adjusting for age."" In the week up to 16 May, one Covid death was of someone aged 75 or over, while the other five deaths were of people aged under 65. Four deaths occurred in hospitals, one death occurred in a care home, and one was in a home or other non-institutional setting.",true/false
27,"While development of The University of Queensland's first iteration of a COVID-19 vaccine will not progress, the process matured their rapid-response ‘molecular clamp’ vaccine technology.  UQ COVID-19 vaccine project co-leader Professor Paul Young, project director Professor Trent Munro, and project co-leader Associate Professor Keith Chappell.© The University of Queensland  In late 2020, the decision was made to abandon further trials of a COVID-19 vaccine being developed by The University of Queensland (UQ) in partnership with biotech company CSL, after participants in a Phase 1 trial returned weak false-positive HIV screening results in some tests. Although there was never any chance of HIV infection, the implications for HIV testing in Australia and for the uptake of the vaccine were deemed sufficient to redirect significant Australian Government commitments to other areas, such as supplying more doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.  Researchers involved in the development of the vaccine, produced using UQ’s proprietary ‘molecular clamp technology’, were disappointed, but some aspects of the work gave them encouragement. “The group was devastated, as we wanted to help,” says Professor Paul Young, project co-leader along with Associate Professor Keith Chappell. “But we've taken many positives out of the project: we are further down the line in validating the platform technology and we’re very confident going forward.”  Why clamps in vaccines?  Enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, infect a host via proteins protruding from their surface that bind to and fuse with a target cell’s membrane, allowing the virus to enter a cell. These fusion proteins are the basis of many subunit vaccines, a type in which a part of the pathogen being vaccinated against is injected to prompt the body to efficiently raise an immune response that can protect against the live virus.  Structural model of the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ectodomain (prepared by D Watterson), stabilized by the molecular clamp (red). https://vimeo.com/392914003© Dr Dan Watterson, The University of Queensland  The SARS-CoV-2 spike or fusion protein is a trimer: a group of three units, each consisting of a receptor-binding subunit, S1, and a subunit responsible for fusion, S2. The three S1 and S2 subunits form a fusion spike embedded in the viral membrane and held in a very particular conformation until it binds to a target cell.  “The fusion protein on the surface of the virus behaves remarkably like a mousetrap in that it's held in a highly tensed form,” explains Young. Binding to a receptor triggers a very rapid structural change, with some parts of the protein flipping through 180°, pulling the viral membrane and the host membrane close together to allow them to fuse.  “The trouble is that the final stable post-fusion form of the protein is not what is on the viral surface and so is not an appropriate form to stimulate a strong protective immune response in a vaccine. Many of the important antigenic sites on the spike protein become hidden or disappear because they literally change shape.” The same conformational change occurs when the spike protein is isolated or made by recombinant technology to produce a soluble subunit vaccine.  UQ’s molecular clamp technology was designed to hold the spike protein in its original form to produce a useful subunit vaccine.  Trying to quickly clamp down on COVID-19  Between 2008 and 2011, Keith Chappell and others had been involved in a study on respiratory syncytial virus-induced disease. That study showed that in naturally infected individuals the majority of potent neutralizing antibodies were those responding to the pre-fusion form of the protein, not the post-fusion form. This was the impetus for building the molecular infrastructure to maintain a spike protein in its pre-fusion form.  The UQ clamp that was developed consists of fragments of the fusion subunit of HIV’s spike protein, gp41. While other trimerization proteins, such as foldon from the T4-phage fibritin, were tried, the resulting structures were unstable and wouldn’t keep well in storage. Further structural modification was needed to achieve stability, whereas fusion proteins clamped using the gp41 fragments were stable on their own.  The gp41 fragment sequences, which are shaped as coils known as alpha helices, link to the end of each of the spike protein’s three fusion subunits (S2s). The alpha helices spontaneously fold and interact with helices on the other monomers. “What you end up with is a very stable, tightly bound six-helical bundle comprising three sets of two alpha helices folded back on themselves,"" explains Chappell. The bundle structure stabilizes the spike protein in its pre-fusion conformation.  Previous work had identified three main areas of the trimeric spike proteins of many enveloped viruses like SARS-CoV-2 where modification might improve stabilization and expression. Using the genetic sequence of the virus that produces the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the researchers used a trial-and-error approach to generate more than 200 versions of the spike protein in a short period. These were monitored to identify those most efficient at generating a stable spike trimer and most efficiently expressed in cells. “This required no knowledge of the protein structure,” stresses Young, “which can significantly speed up the process of producing vaccines for newly identified viruses.”  The UQ group had previously generated clamped fusion proteins of more than 10 different viruses using gp41, including Ebola, MERS, a wide range of influenza types, herpes simplex, and Nipah viruses. An important proof-of-principle result was rapid antigen production against two, somewhat exotic, but potential emerging viral pathogens - a paramyxovirus first identified in Achimota in Ghana and a mammarenavirus first identified in Wenzhou in China.  “We asked whether we could take a sequence from these two viruses, apply the principles we’ve learnt and make a vaccine candidate very quickly, without knowing anything about the protein structure,"" explains Chappell. “The whole intent was to apply the technology to the threat of emerging disease,” notes Young.  UQ COVID-19 vaccine team member Eve Radunz.© The University of Queensland  False positives stop planned trials  The detection of false HIV positives in all of the trial participants, albeit at very low levels and only in some assay types, halted progress to the next stage of trials. “The design of the clamp was such that the major antibody binding sites of gp41 weren’t present, so we had anticipated that if there was an antibody response to HIV it would be very minor,” says Young. HIV diagnostic assays only detect human antibodies, so it was not until the Phase 1 trial that researchers could really test for the impact of diagnostic interference. Participants were advised ahead of the trial of this possibility.  “The diagnostic cross-reactivity was very weak, and although there was never any chance of HIV infection, a wide-scale rollout of the vaccine would have a real impact on the way we diagnose HIV,” says Young. The association with HIV may also have had an impact on vaccine uptake. While their Phase 1 trial will be completed this year, the planned Phase 2/3 trials have been taken off the table.  “You need to remember we were in the middle of a research project, and the plan was to look at a wide range of clamp constructs, but when the pandemic hit we went with using what we had in our toolbox, the gp41 construct, which we knew was working well in animal models. If COVID-19 had hit in 2021 and not 2020 we would have had an extra year to do that work,” says Young.  Current work is focused on looking at similar clamp constructs from other viruses and systems that have the same level of stability as gp41 in order to re-engineer a clamp 2.0.  “I don’t use the word ‘failure’,” says Young. “It is the lessons learnt from these experiences that help you go forward.”",true/false

The aim is to inform users, who range from a healthcare professional to an inquiring citizen, about appointments within primary care. NHS Digital produce this information monthly, containing information about the previous 30 months (where available).The aim of the publication is to inform users about activity and usage of GP appointments historically and how primary care is impacted by seasonal pressures, such as winter.  The publication initially included data from participating practices using EMIS and TPP GP systems. Cegedim data was first included in the June 2019 release, with data from January 2018; Informatica data was first added in the June 2020 release with data from December 2018. Data from both these GP systems will continue to be included in subsequent releases. Microtest data was first included in the April 2019 release, with data from November 2018; and has since ceased providing data as of February 2021. Babylon (GP at Hand) data was first added in the March 2022 release with data from January 2021.  The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major effect on how GP practices manage their workload. Following requests from users, we are now releasing a Weekly Management Information Report to provide greater transparency and more timely data from our General Practice Appointments Data collection. Management Information data may show slight differences when compared to the monthly official statistics subsequently released, due to data cleansing processes applied.  Data is collected from GP systems, which are designed for practices to use in everyday work and not for the purpose of data analysis. There are no national standards for data entry about activity and there is widespread variation in approach to appointment management between practices. This means that there are variations in data quality between practices. This information does not give a complete view of GP activity so should not be used to infer a view of workload. The publication covers scheduled and planned activity recorded on the GP appointment system only, rather than the totality of interactions or activity/workload. It does not reflect all work happening within a primary care setting or assess the complexity of activity.

29,"(CNN) A US Capitol police officer is the latest to be confirmed dead after a mob of President Trump's supporters stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday.  Four other people died during the stunning attack at the heart of American democracy as mob members vandalized the building and assaulted police officers. One woman was fatally shot by police and three people died of apparent medical emergencies.  Several DC Metropolitan Police officers were also injured during the insurrection, police Chief Robert Contee said. One officer had significant facial injuries from being struck by a projectile, and another officer was hospitalized after being pepper-sprayed.  Here's what we know about the people who died:  Officer dies after being injured  Capitol Police released a statement saying Officer Brian D. Sicknick passed away Thursday night ""due to injuries sustained while on-duty.""  Officer Sicknick was injured while physically engaging with the rioters and collapsed after returning to his division office. ""He was taken to a local hospital where he succumbed to his injuries,"" the Capitol Police statement said.  Officer Sicknick joined the USCP in July 2008, and most recently served in the Department's First Responder's Unit.  ""The entire USCP Department expresses its deepest sympathies to Officer Sicknick's family and friends on their loss, and mourns the loss of a friend and colleague,"" Capitol Police added.  His death is now being investigated.  United States Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick  Sicknick was originally from South River, New Jersey, and the youngest of three sons, according to a statement issued by his brother on behalf of his family.  Sicknick ""wanted to be a police officer his entire life,"" his brother Ken said, and joined the New Jersey National Guard in his pursuit of that goal.  According to a statement from New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy's office, Sicknick was a staff sergeant for the New Jersey National Guard. He served as a fire team member and a leader of the 108th Security Force Squadron, 108th Wing, at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, Murphy's statement said.  Sicknick's service included two deployments -- one as part of Operation Southern Watch and another as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, Murphy said.  Sicknick's family was ""very proud"" of his service to his country, Ken Sicknick said.  ""Brian is a hero, and that is what we would like people to remember,"" he said.  Air Force veteran fatally shot by police  A woman was fatally shot by a US Capitol Police employee as the mob tried to force its way toward the House Chamber where members of Congress were sheltering, US Capitol Police said in a statement.  The woman was given medical assistance immediately and taken to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead.  Authorities identified her as Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old from Huntington, Maryland.  Babbit's mother, Michelle Witthoeft told CNN on Thursday she was devastated to learn of her daughter's death.  ""I loved and admired her greatly,"" Witthoeft said of Babbitt. ""She served this country boldly and proudly.""  Babbitt was an ardent Trump supporter who held strong political views, her mother said, and was ""passionate enough to die for what she believed in.""  Babbitt, who was previously married but separated from her husband in 2019, frequently attended pro-Trump rallies. She flew to Washington, DC, from San Diego, California, with the intent to participate in the protest this week, her mother said.  ""Her political views were strong and adamant, and she voiced them whenever she could,"" Witthoeft said.

Hide Caption 42 of 42  A CNN review of Babbitt's social media accounts determined Babbitt frequently voiced support for President Trump and other conservative figures on Facebook. She also shared content promoting political conspiracy theories often pushed by far-right figures.  Babbitt served as a senior airman in the US Air Force from 2004 to 2008 under the name Ashli Elizabeth McEntee, according to military records. She was a member of the Air Force Reserve from 2008 to 2010 and was in the Air National Guard from 2010 until November 2016, records show.  ""She served in the United States Air Force and was deployed four times and came back safely, only to have her own country shoot her down,"" Witthoeft said tearfully by phone.  The US Capitol Police employee who shot Babbitt has been placed on administrative leave and their police powers have been suspended pending a joint Metro Police and USCP investigation, USCP said.  ""This is a tragic incident, and I send my condolences to the victim's family and friends,"" Metro Police Chief Contee said.  Two people who saw the shooting, left-wing activist John Sullivan and documentary filmmaker Jade Sacker, provided CNN with video of the incident and described the moments beforehand.  Sullivan said rioters were using flag poles and other items to smash glass windows inside the Capitol. The woman then tried to make her way through the window when several people with guns came out through the doorways.  ""The second that she climbed through the window she got shot right in the neck area, fell backwards,"" Sullivan said in an interview that broadcast on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360.""  ""I just remember the sense of shock and sorrow that somebody just died and did not need to die.""  The woman was trying to enter an area that did not yet appear to have been breached by rioters, Sullivan said.  ""It was an area that was completely blocked off,"" he said. ""They had chairs up against the doorway, tables, so people couldn't get in.""  Three others dead  Three other people who had come from out of state died of ""medical emergencies"" during the riot, police said.  ""One adult female and two adult males appear to have suffered from separate medical emergencies, which resulted in their deaths,"" Contee said. ""Any loss of life in the District is tragic and our thoughts are with anyone impacted by their loss.""  They were identified as Benjamin Philips, 50, of Ringtown, Pennsylvania; Kevin Greeson, 55, of Athens, Alabama; and Rosanne Boyland, 34, of Kennesaw, Georgia. The three were on the grounds of the Capitol when they experienced their medical emergencies, Contee said.  Kevin Greeson  Greeson had a history of high blood pressure and suffered a heart attack amid the excitement, his family said in a statement to CNN. He was an advocate of Trump and attended the event to show his support.  ""He was excited to be there to experience this event,"" the statement said. ""He was not there to participate in violence or rioting, nor did he condone such actions.""  The family says they are devastated by the loss.  ""Kevin was a wonderful father and husband who loved life,"" the family statement said. ""He loved to ride motorcycles, he loved his job and his coworkers, and he loved his dogs.""  Boyland's family is also mourning her death, her brother-in-law, Justin Cave, told CNN affiliate WGCL . The family is still working to learn more details about the specifics of her death, he said.  As the family watched Wednesday's events, they hoped that Boyland wasn't among the crowd, Cave said. ""Tragically she was there and it cost her life,"" he said.  ""She was a wonderful sister, daughter, and aunt. Anyone who knew her knows how compassionate she was, she always put others before herself,"" Cave said.

The book presents an outline of what Mr. Bolton might testify to if he is called as a witness in the Senate impeachment trial, the people said. The White House could use the pre-publication review process, which has no set time frame, to delay or even kill the book’s publication or omit key passages.  Just after midnight on Monday, Mr. Trump denied telling Mr. Bolton that the aid was tied to investigations. “If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book,” he wrote on Twitter, reprising his argument that the Ukrainians themselves felt “no pressure” and falsely asserting that the aid was released ahead of schedule.  Over dozens of pages, Mr. Bolton described how the Ukraine affair unfolded over several months until he departed the White House in September. He described not only the president’s private disparagement of Ukraine but also new details about senior cabinet officials who have publicly tried to sidestep involvement.  For example, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged privately that there was no basis to claims by the president’s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani that the ambassador to Ukraine was corrupt and believed Mr. Giuliani may have been acting on behalf of other clients, Mr. Bolton wrote.  Mr. Bolton also said that after the president’s July phone call with the president of Ukraine, he raised with Attorney General William P. Barr his concerns about Mr. Giuliani, who was pursuing a shadow Ukraine policy encouraged by the president, and told Mr. Barr that the president had mentioned him on the call.

31,"Pediatricians are eager to help protect children and families by administering the vaccine, the most effective prevention tool available since the start of the pandemic  ITASCA, IL—The American Academy of Pediatrics supports today’s recommendation by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to recommend the use of a COVID-19 vaccine in children ages 5-11. The AAP urges families to check with their pediatrician and community health care providers about how to get their eligible children vaccinated, pending a final recommendation from the CDC.  Vaccinating children will protect children’s health and allow them to fully engage in all of the activities that are so important to their health and development. Parents can enjoy greater peace of mind gathering with family members this winter and sending their children to school, sports and other events that were paused during the height of the pandemic.  “Sharing this life-saving vaccine with our children is a huge step forward and provides us all with more confidence and optimism about the future,” said AAP President Lee Savio Beers, MD, FAAP. “Pediatricians are eager to participate in the immunization process and talk with families about this vaccine. We want to ensure that access to this vaccine is equitable, and that every child is able to benefit.”  Immediately after the ACIP vote to recommend the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 to 11, the AAP published its updated recommendations for COVID-19 vaccine, including a strong recommendation for children in this age group to receive the vaccine pending the final decision by the CDC. The AAP recommends COVID-19 vaccination for all children and adolescents 5 years of age and older who do not have contraindications using a vaccine authorized for use for their age. Children with prior COVID-19 infection or disease should receive a COVID-19 vaccination to prevent a second infection and to lower the risk of severe illness and hospitalization.  The Academy also updated its interim school guidance, which calls for the continued use of layers of protection, including universal mask-wearing in schools to protect all students and adults. AAP strongly advocates for in-person learning, which can happen safely with adherence to recommended policies and procedures. The guidance revision emphasizes the importance of immunization and masking as the most important risk mitigation strategies, as supported by new evidence.  “We know from our experience with the Delta variant that this virus is unpredictable, and we cannot afford to be complacent. It is critical to use science and data to guide our decisions about the pandemic and school COVID-19 plans,” Dr. Beers said. “We have also entered flu season, and now have an opportunity for children to receive vaccinations for both the flu and COVID-19, which can be done during a single visit.”  The AAP recognizes that disparities in school funding, quality of school facilities, educational staffing, and resources for enriching curricula among schools have been exacerbated by the pandemic. Ongoing federal, state, and local funding should be provided for all schools so they can continue to implement all the COVID-19 mitigation and safety measures required to protect students and staff.

32,"The oldest and thickest sea ice in the Arctic has started to break up, opening waters north of Greenland that are normally frozen, even in summer.  This phenomenon – which has never been recorded before – has occurred twice this year due to warm winds and a climate-change driven heatwave in the northern hemisphere.  One meteorologist described the loss of ice as “scary”. Others said it could force scientists to revise their theories about which part of the Arctic will withstand warming the longest.  The sea off the north coast of Greenland is normally so frozen that it was referred to, until recently, as “the last ice area” because it was assumed that this would be the final northern holdout against the melting effects of a hotter planet.  But abnormal temperature spikes in February and earlier this month have left it vulnerable to winds, which have pushed the ice further away from the coast than at any time since satellite records began in the 1970s.  “Almost all of the ice to the north of Greenland is quite shattered and broken up and therefore more mobile,” said Ruth Mottram of the Danish Meteorological Institute. “Open water off the north coast of Greenland is unusual. This area has often been called ‘the last ice area’ as it has been suggested that the last perennial sea ice in the Arctic will occur here. The events of the last week suggest that, actually, the last ice area may be further west.”  Ice to the north of Greenland is usually particularly compacted due to the Transpolar Drift Stream, one of two major weather patterns that push ice from Siberia across the Arctic to the coastline, where it packs.  Walt Meier, a senior research scientist at the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, said: “The ice there has nowhere else to go so it piles up. On average, it’s over four metres thick and can be piled up into ridges 20 metres thick or more. This thick, compacted ice is generally not easily moved around.  “However, that was not the case this past winter (in February and March) and now. The ice is being pushed away from the coast by the winds.”  Q&A How is climate change affecting the Arctic? Show The world may have warmed by about 1C (1.8F) over the past century but the Arctic far outstrips this global average and is warming at about twice the rate of the rest of the world. In places, the rate of warming has been astonishing. Novembers in the Alaskan town of Utqiaġvik, formerly Barrow, are now 5.5C warmer than they were in 1979. In the summer of 2019, an Arctic heatwave had parts of Greenland reach temperatures 40C hotter than normal. The Arctic is dominated by sea ice, unlike the Antarctic, which is essentially a huge land-based ice sheet. As the ocean and atmosphere warm, sea ice is shrinking in extent, at about 13% a decade since 1979, according to Nasa. The bright white surface of ice, known as albedo, is giving way to the dark ocean, meaning that sunlight is being absorbed rather than reflected, amplifying the warming effect. These rapid and unprecedented changes are transforming the Arctic and threatening traditional ways of life, according to US government scientists in a 2019 report card. The sea ice is younger, thinner, more fragile and less extensive, making hunting on the ice harder and more perilous. The marine ecosystem is shifting as warmer water forces fish species to retreat to more northern waters. What is a significant challenge to communities in the Arctic, is a boon to the shipping industry, which can navigate the area more easily. This task will become even simpler once the Arctic is ice-free in summertimes, forecast as soon as the 2040s.  Ice is easier to blow around as a result of a warming trend, which has accelerated over the past 15 years. “The thinning is reaching even the coldest part of the Arctic with the thickest ice. So it’s a pretty dramatic indication of the transformation of the Arctic sea ice and Arctic climate.”  “Scary,” wrote Thomas Lavergne, a scientist at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, in a retweet of a satellite-gif of the blue water penetrating white ice and exposing hundreds of miles of the Greenland coastline.  So the open water / low concentration patch North for Greenland is still there (and slowly moving westward). Nice and scary. From https://t.co/jPx1JmNayA https://t.co/hGstLYafcW — Thomas Lavergne (@lavergnetho) August 13, 2018  He said this would flush chunks of thicker ice out through the Fram or Nares Straits into warmer southern waters.  “I cannot tell how long this open water patch will remain open, but even if it closes in few days from now, the harm will be done: the thick old sea ice will have been pushed away from the coast, to an area where it will melt more easily,” he added.  This year’s openings are driven more by wind than melting but they have occurred during two temperature spikes. In February, the Kap Morris Jesup weather station in the region is usually below -20C, but earlier this year there were 10 days above freezing and warm winds, which unlocked the ice from the coast.  Arctic sea ice extent for 15 August 2018 was 5.7m sq km (2.2m sq miles). The orange line shows the 1981 to 2010 average extent for that day. Photograph: NSIDC  Last week, the crack opened again after Kap Morris Jesup briefly registered a record high of 17C and strong southerly winds picked up to 11 knots. Experts predict that coastal seas will freeze again but probably later than normal.  “I think that solar heating of the water column will increase during this opening and this will delay freeze-up and ice formation,” said Rasmus Tage Tonboe, a sea ice expert at the the Danish Meteorological Institute.  The latest readings by the Norwegian Ice Service show that Arctic ice cover in the Svalbard area this week is 40% below the average for this time of year since 1981. In the past month, at least 14 days in the past month have hit record lows in this region. Although thinner ice elsewhere in the Arctic means this is unlikely to be a record low year overall, they are in line with predictions that there will be no summer ice in the Arctic Ocean at some point between 2030 and 2050.  Keld Qvistgaard, the ice service coordinator in Denmark, said this was not the first time a gap had appeared between the shore and the main ice pack but the one formed from 1 to 5 August was different in its extent. “This event is a pretty big one going all the way to west of Kap Morris Jesup. This is unusual,” he said.  As well as reducing ice cover, the ocean intrusion raises concerns of feedbacks, which could tip the Earth towards a hothouse state.  Freakish Arctic temperatures have alarmed climate scientists since the beginning of the year. During the sunless winter, a heatwave raised concerns that the polar vortex may be eroding.  This includes the Gulf Stream, which is at its weakest level in 1,600 years due to melting Greenland ice and ocean warming. With lower circulation of water and air, weather systems tend to linger longer.  A dormant hot front has been blamed for record temperatures in Lapland and forest fires in Siberia, much of Scandinavia and elsewhere in the Arctic circle.",true/false

34,"President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday announced an extension to lockdown directive on Lagos, Ogun and Abuja. The extension will last 14 days from Monday night, after the initial 14 days lockdown. The president said this in his address to Nigerians. He thanked Nigerians for sacrifices made by complying with stay-at-home directives in order to check the spread of coronavirus. Read the full text of the president’s speech below. ADDRESS BY H.E. MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA ON THE EXTENSION OF COVID- 19 PANDEMIC LOCKDOWN AT THE STATE HOUSE, ABUJA MONDAY, 13TH APRIL, 2020 1. Fellow Nigerians 2. In my address on Sunday, 29th March, 2020, I asked the residents of Lagos and Ogun States as well as the Federal Capital Territory to stay at home for an initial period of fourteen days starting from Monday, 30th March 2020. 3. Many State Governments also introduced similar restrictions. 4. As your democratically elected leaders, we made this very difficult decision knowing fully well it will severely disrupt your livelihoods and bring undue hardship to you, your loved ones and your communities. 5. However, such sacrifices are needed to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our country. They were necessary to save lives. 6. Our objective was, and still remains, to contain the spread of the Coronavirus and to provide space, time and resources for an aggressive and collective action. 7. The level of compliance to the COVID-19 guidelines issued has been generally good across the country. I wish to thank you all most sincerely for the great sacrifice you are making for each other at this critical time. 8. I will take this opportunity to recognise the massive support from our traditional rulers, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) during this pandemic. 9. I also acknowledge the support and contributions received from public spirited individuals, the business community and our international partners and friends. 10. I must also thank the media houses, celebrities and other public figures for the great work they are doing in sensitizing our citizens on hygienic practices, social distancing and issues associated with social gatherings. 11. As a result of the overwhelming support and cooperation received, we were able to achieve a lot during these 14 days of initial lockdown. 12. We implemented comprehensive public health measures that intensified our case identification, testing, isolation and contact tracing capabilities. ADVERTISEMENT 13. To date, we have identified 92% of all identified contacts while doubling the number of testing laboratories in the country and raising our testing capacity to 1,500 tests per day. 14. We also trained over 7,000 Healthcare workers on infection prevention and control while deploying NCDC teams to 19 states of the federation. 15. Lagos and Abuja today have the capacity to admit some 1,000 patients each across several treatment centres. 16. Many State Governments have also made provisions for isolation wards and treatment centres. We will also build similar centers near our airports and land borders. 17. Using our resources and those provided through donations, we will adequately equip and man these centres in the coming weeks. Already, health care workers across all the treatment centers have been provided with the personal protective equipment that they need to safely carry out the care they provide. 18. Our hope and prayers are that we do not have to use all these centres. But we will be ready for all eventualities. 19. At this point, I must recognise the incredible work being done by our healthcare workers and volunteers across the country especially in frontline areas of Lagos and Ogun States as well as the Federal Capital Territory. 20. You are our heroes and as a nation, we will forever remain grateful for your sacrifice during this very difficult time. More measures to motivate our health care workers are being introduced which we will announce in the coming weeks. 21. As a nation, we are on the right track to win the fight against COVID-19. 22. However, I remain concerned about the increase in number of confirmed cases and deaths being reported across the world and in Nigeria specifically. 23. On 30th March 2020, when we started our lockdown in conforming with medical and scientific advice, the total number of confirmed cases across the world was over 780,000. 24. Yesterday, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases globally was over one million, eight hundred and fifty thousand. This figure is more than double in two weeks! READ ALSO: 25. In the last fourteen days alone, over 70,000 people have died due to this disease. 26. In the same period, we have seen the health system of even the most developed nations being overwhelmed by this virus. 27. Here in Nigeria, we had 131 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 12 States on 30th March 2020. We had two fatalities then. 28. This morning, Nigeria had 323 confirmed cases in twenty States. Unfortunately we now have ten fatalities. Lagos State remains the center and accounts for 54% of the confirmed cases in Nigeria. When combined with the FCT, the two locations represent over 71% of the confirmed cases in Nigeria. 29. Most of our efforts will continue to focus in these two locations. 30. Majority of the confirmed cases in Lagos and the FCT are individuals with recent international travel history or those that came into contact with returnees from international trips. 31. By closing our airports and land borders and putting strict conditions for seaport activities, we have reduced the impact of external factors on our country. However, the increase in the number of States with positive cases is alarming. 32. The National Centre for Disease Control has informed me that, a large proportion of new infections are now occurring in our communities, through person-to-person contacts. So we must pay attention to the danger of close contact between person to person. 33. At this point, I will remind all Nigerians to continue to take responsibility for the recommended measures to prevent transmission, including maintaining physical distancing, good personal hygiene and staying at home. 34. In addition, I have signed the Quarantine Order in this regard and additional regulations to provide clarity in respect of the control measures for the COVID-19 pandemic which will be released soon. 35. The public health response to COVID-19 is built on our ability to detect, test and admit cases as well as trace all their contacts. While I note some appreciable progress, we can achieve a lot more. 36. Today, the cessation of movement, physical distancing measures and the prohibition of mass gatherings remain the most efficient and effective way of reducing the transmission of the virus. By sustaining these measures, combined with extensive testing and contact tracing, we can take control and limit the spread of the disease. 37. Our approach to the virus remains in 2 steps – First, to protect the lives of our fellow Nigerians and residents living here and second, to preserve the livelihoods of workers and business owners. 38. With this in mind and having carefully considered the briefings and Report from the Presidential Task Force and the various options offered, it has become necessary to extend the current restriction of movement in Lagos and Ogun States as well as the FCT for another 14 days effective from 11:59 pm on Monday, 13th of April, 2020. I am therefore once again asking you all to work with Government in this fight. 39. This is not a joke. It is a matter of life and death. Mosques in Makkah and Madina have been closed. The Pope celebrated Mass on an empty St. Peter’s Square. The famous Notre Dame cathedral in Paris held Easter Mass with less than 10 people. India, Italy and France are in complete lockdown. Other countries are in the process of following suit. We cannot be lax. 40. The previously issued guidelines on exempted services shall remain. 41. This is a difficult decision to take, but I am convinced that this is the right decision. The evidence is clear. 42. The repercussions of any premature end to the lockdown action are unimaginable. 43. We must not lose the gains achieved thus far. We must not allow a rapid increase in community transmission. We must endure a little longer. 44. I will therefore take this opportunity to urge you all to notify the relevant authorities if you or your loved ones develop any symptoms. I will also ask our health care professionals to redouble their efforts to identify all suspected cases, bring them into care and prevent transmission to others. 45. No country can afford the full impact of a sustained restriction of movement on its economy. I am fully aware of the great difficulties experienced especially by those who earn a daily wage such as traders, day-workers, artisans and manual workers. 46. For this group, their sustenance depends on their ability to go out. Their livelihoods depend on them mingling with others and about seeking work. But despite these realities we must not change the restrictions. 47. In the past two weeks, we announced palliative measures such as food distribution, cash transfers and loans repayment waivers to ease the pains of our restrictive policies during this difficult time. These palliatives will be sustained. 48. I have also directed that the current social register be expanded from 2.6 million households to 3.6 million households in the next two weeks. This means we will support an additional one million homes with our social investment programs. A technical committee is working on this and will submit a report to me by the end of this week. 49. The Security Agencies have risen to the challenges posed by this unprecedented situation with gallantry and I commend them. I urge them to continue to maintain utmost vigilance, firmness as well as restraint in enforcing the restriction orders while not neglecting statutory security responsibilities. 50. Fellow Nigerians, follow the instructions on social distancing. The irresponsibility of the few can lead to the death of the many. Your freedom ends where other people’s rights begin. 51. The response of our State Governors has been particularly impressive, especially in aligning their policies and actions to those of the Federal Government. 52. In the coming weeks, I want to assure you that the Federal Government, through the Presidential Task Force, will do whatever it takes to support you in this very difficult period. I have no doubt that, by working together and carefully following the rules, we shall get over this pandemic. 53. I must also thank the Legislative arm of Government for all its support and donations in this very difficult period. This collaboration is critical to the short and long-term success of all the measures that we have instituted in response to the pandemic. 54. As a result of this pandemic, the world as we know it has changed. The way we interact with each other, conduct our businesses and trade, travel, educate our children and earn our livelihoods will be different. 55. To ensure our economy adapts to this new reality, I am directing the Ministers of Industry, Trade and Investment, Communication and Digital Economy, Science and Technology, Transportation, Aviation, Interior, Health, Works and Housing, Labour and Employment and Education to jointly develop a comprehensive policy for a “Nigerian economy functioning with COVID-19”. 56. The Ministers will be supported by the Presidential Economic Advisory Council and Economic Sustainability Committee in executing this mandate. 57. I am also directing the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, the National Security Adviser, the Vice Chairman, National Food Security Council and the Chairman, Presidential Fertiliser Initiative to work with the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to ensure the impact of this pandemic on our 2020 farming season is minimized. 58. Finally, I want to thank the members of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 for all their hard work so far. Indeed, the patriotism shown in your work is exemplary and highly commendable. 59. Fellow Nigerians, I have no doubt that by working together and carefully following the rules, we shall get over this pandemic and emerge stronger in the end. 60. I thank you all for listening and may God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.",true/false

An estimated 597 homeless people died in 2017, a rise of 24% over the last five years. Today's Office for National Statistics figures were released less than 36 hours after a homeless man was found dying outside Parliament. Days before Christmas the man - named by friends as Gyula Remes - was found in an underpass next to Westminster Tube station and died later in hospital. He was the second homeless man known to have died near the Palace of Westminster this year On Thursday the Speaker of the House of Commons also expressed his sadness at the death. He said: May I express my sadness on behalf of the whole house at the death yesterday in the subway. They mostly cover people sleeping rough or using emergency accommodation at or around the time of death. Image: Facebook Today's statistics, the first official figures detailing the number of people who have died while homeless estimate 482 homeless people died in 2013; 475 in 2014; 508 in 2015; 565 in 2016; and 597 in 2017. Leading homeless charity Crisis called the situation a national tragedy. Chief Executive, Jon Sparkes, said: “ It’s shocking to think that hundreds of people faced the last days of their lives without the dignity of a secure roof over their head. This is nothing short of a national tragedy - especially when we know that homelessness is not inevitable. He added: “Behind these statistics are human beings – mothers, fathers, daughters and sons – whose families will now be spending Christmas coming to terms with their loss. This has to change. Governments must urgently expand the system used to investigate the deaths of vulnerable adults to include all those who have died while street homeless, so that crucial lessons can be learned to help prevent more people from dying needlessly. We must also recognise that many people who are homeless have complex needs that have either led to their homelessness, or developed because of it. It’s crucial that there are services in place to support people in these vulnerable circumstances, before it’s too late. Almost all of last year's homeless deaths were men, at 84%. Homeless men died on average at the age of 44 and women at 42 in that period, compared to 76 and 81 for the general population. Homeless deaths in England and Wales ONS London and the North West of England had the highest mortality rates. London was the worst hit last year with more than a fifth of the estimated deaths, at 136, while the North West had 119. But over that period the estimated death toll in London remained largely stable, whereas the North West saw a jump of 115% from 55. Estimates for the North East also saw a 71% increase, from 18 to 32. It was estimated that last year more than one in 10 homeless deaths were due to suicide, while more than two-fifths was due to drug poisoning or alcohol-related. Melanie Onn MP, Labour’s Shadow Housing Minister, said: “These figures are utterly shameful and reflect a complete failure of Conservative policy on housing, which has seen rough sleeping skyrocket since 2010. “We are one of the richest countries in the world and there is no excuse for people dying on our streets. “Labour will provide £100m to ensure that everyone has shelter when it becomes dangerously cold. We will end rough sleeping within five years to ensure that everyone has a place to call home.” Housing Secretary James Brokenshire described the figures as stark. Answering an urgent question he told the House of Commons: Every death of someone sleeping rough on our streets is one too many. He added: No one chooses to be on the street - no one chooses that life. Theresa May's spokesman said: “These figures are clearly very concerning. “Every death on our streets is one too many and it's unacceptable to see lives cut short this way. “We are determined to help the most vulnerable in society – that's why we are investing £1.2billion to tackle homelessness, and on taking action to halve rough sleeping by 2022 and end it altogether by 2027.” Asked what the PM thought was behind the rise, her spokesman said: “These are complex issues but what's important is that we are working hard to address this with partners.” Asked about the death on Parliament's doorstep, he added: “There is an investigation which has begun into that but obviously our sympathies go to his family and his friends and all those who knew him.” Asked if the PM “feels a sense of shame” because the man had been sleeping rough outside Parliament, her spokesman said: “The PM's thoughts are with all those who knew the guy, and it's very tragic.”",true/false
37,"Story highlights Global sea level is on the rise at an increasing rate, according to a new study  By the end of the century, it could rise another 2 feet  (CNN) Sea level rise is happening now, and the rate at which it is rising is increasing every year, according to a study released Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  Researchers, led by University of Colorado-Boulder professor of aerospace engineering sciences Steve Nerem, used satellite data dating to 1993 to observe the levels of the world's oceans.  Changes in sea level observed between 1992 and 2014. Orange/red colors represent higher sea levels, while blue colors show where sea levels are lower.  Using satellite data rather than tide-gauge data that is normally used to measure sea levels allows for more precise estimates of global sea level, since it provides measurements of the open ocean.  The team observed a total rise in the ocean of 7 centimeters (2.8 inches) in 25 years of data, which aligns with the generally accepted current rate of sea level rise of about 3 millimeters (0.1 inches) per year.  But that rate is not constant.  Read More",true/false
38,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for use in children ages five to 11. Pfizer’s clinical trial results indicate the vaccine is safe and effective in this age group.  This is an important development. COVID-19 infections are on the rise in children across Canada.  It is now up to Health Canada to consider the data and to decide whether to authorize this COVID-19 vaccine for children. Once it is authorized in Canada, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) will have to decide whether to recommend vaccination for all children in this age group.  This raises the question of how this decision ought to be made.  Making an ethical decision  As a moral philosopher who has collaboratively researched ethical issues relating to the vaccination of children, I believe it is important to answer this question, for two reasons.  First, whatever the decision, the principles on which it is based — and should be based — must be clear and transparent.  Second, surprisingly little attention has been paid to this issue in Canada, despite the decision to vaccinate children being a matter of science and ethics. Science can clarify some of the costs and benefits of vaccination, but it cannot tell us which costs and benefits matter and when a cost-benefit ratio is favourable.  Fortunately, there is no need to generate a decision-making procedure from scratch. The procedure used by the United Kingdom’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) in deciding whether to vaccinate healthy children aged 12-15 in the U.K. can provide important lessons about what not to do.  Risks and benefits  The most important factor is whether the benefits of vaccination outweigh its risks, and the degree to which the benefits outweigh the risks. In weighing these, the JCVI relied on what it called the “health perspective.”  Reasoning from this perspective, the JCVI held (in a series of public statements) that the chief benefits of vaccination against COVID-19 were the prevention of death, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) or multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).  The chief harms of vaccination were myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart, and pericarditis, inflammation of the thin sack surrounding the heart, though it said these were rare and “typically self-limiting and resolved within a short time.”  The JCVI argued that the benefits of vaccination in this age group are only “marginally greater” than the harms and that therefore vaccination would not be offered to all members of this group.  THE CANADIAN PRESS/Winnipeg Free Press-Mike Deal  NACI disagreed, but did not outline the ethical principles it relied on in recommending vaccination for children ages 12-17.  JCVI’s decision not to offer all children vaccination against COVID-19 was flawed in numerous respects. (It was later overruled by the chief medical officers of the U.K.‘s four nations.) NACI will do well to avoid these mistakes in making its decision about vaccinating children ages five to 11.  The Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Independent SAGE, a group of British scientists offering independent scientific advice on the prevention of COVID-19) has raised a number of concerns about the JCVI’s decision-making process.  One concern is the way in which the JCVI calculated the benefits of vaccination, basing these calculations on risk to the population of all children of death, hospitalization, ICU admission and so on from COVID-19 infection, rather than the risks of these to children with a confirmed infection of COVID-19.  Another concern Independent SAGE raised was that the JCVI did not state which vaccine it considered when it examined the risks, a relevant concern since heart inflammation rates appear to be higher after the Moderna vaccine than after the Pfizer vaccine.  Direct and indirect benefits  Some of JVCI’s other mistakes related to value judgments, relying on the health perspective to make its decision. However, the JCVI was not consistent on what this included.  As noted, the JCVI mentioned the prevention of death, hospitalization, ICU admission and PIMS or MIS-C. These are not the only health benefits of vaccination against COVID-19. Some direct and indirect health benefits of vaccination were not clearly included.  The direct benefits include the prevention of long COVID — a condition affecting anywhere from two to 14 per cent of children infected with COVID-19 — and potential neurological and cognitive deficits caused by COVID-19 infection.  THE CANADIAN PRESS/Nathan Denette  Preventing the negative mental and physical health effects associated with school closures, limits on sporting and other such activities and physical distancing requirements are among the indirect benefits (though these were rightly noted by NACI in its recommendation to vaccinate adolescents). These health effects are important when deciding whether to vaccinate.  These are the known risks and benefits. However, the JCVI’s refusal to recommend vaccination to all children aged 12-15 was due to the uncertainties “regarding the magnitude of the potential harms” of vaccination, including myocarditis.  Although it gave considerable weight to unknown harms or uncertainties of vaccination, the JVCI did not consider potential unknown benefits of vaccination, or uncertainties about benefits. There was no reason to rule these out. Uncertainties about benefits seem to be of as much importance in thinking about the risk benefit profile of COVID-19 vaccination as uncertainties about risks. These, again, matter greatly to this decision.  The JCVI made another ethical error when it said the harms of vaccination should be given greater weight (relatively speaking) than the benefits.  There is no good reason to place a higher relative value on harms compared to benefits. Harms caused by vaccines are not worse than harms caused by COVID-19. It does not appear to be true that the rare and typically mild pericarditis or the myocarditis caused by vaccination is any worse than the pericarditis or the myocarditis caused (at greater frequency) by COVID-19 infection. This is not in line with other treatments considered for children, for which harms are not typically weighed more heavily than benefits.  The well-being perspective  It was a mistake for JCVI to make the decision about vaccination against COVID-19 in children purely on the basis of the health perspective. Health is important. But it is not the only value in the lives of children. Health is a priority because without it many other important benefits — enjoying friends, connecting with relatives, absorbing oneself in homework or music lessons — become much more difficult, if not impossible.  The JCVI mentioned the beneficial effects of vaccination on education. But it did not factor these benefits into the decision relating to vaccinating children against COVID-19.  Educational and other benefits afforded to children by vaccination matter greatly and must be factored into this decision. Moving beyond the health perspective into the well-being perspective encompasses a larger range of benefits and protections from vaccination, including safe and stable learning environments, time with extended family, sport, music performances and the many other things that make life happy and meaningful for children.  When making the decision whether to vaccinate children aged five to 11 against COVID-19, regulators in Canada must rely on both sound science and sound ethics. They must in particular consider all the health and well-being impacts of vaccination more generally; they must consider the uncertain harms and benefits of vaccination; and they must treat benefits and harms symmetrically.  Doing so will show that vaccinating children is, all things considered, beneficial.  Do you have a question about COVID-19 vaccines?

39,"Anthony “Tony” Fauci has become the scientific face of America’s COVID-19 response, and he says the best evidence shows the virus behind the pandemic was not made in a lab in China.  Fauci, the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, shot down the discussion that has been raging among politicians and pundits, calling it “a circular argument” in a conversation Monday with National Geographic.  “If you look at the evolution of the virus in bats and what's out there now, [the scientific evidence] is very, very strongly leaning toward this could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated … Everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that [this virus] evolved in nature and then jumped species,” Fauci says. Based on the scientific evidence, he also doesn’t entertain an alternate theory—that someone found the coronavirus in the wild, brought it to a lab, and then it accidentally escaped.  Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.  Fauci is most concerned that the United States will be put to the test this fall and winter by a second wave of COVID-19 if the country does not blunt the infection rate by the summer.  “Shame on us if we don't have enough tests by the time this so-called return might occur in the fall and winter,” he says, advising that the U.S. needs to make sure we not only have an adequate supply of tests available before a second wave hits, but also a system for getting those tests to the people who most need them.  “I don't think there's a chance that this virus is just going to disappear,” he says. “It's going to be around, and if given the opportunity, it will resurge.” As such, Fauci says the U.S. should also focus this summer on properly reinforcing the nation’s health care system, ensuring the availability of hospital beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment for health care workers.  He also stressed the importance of continuing to social distance everywhere until the case counts start to fall in cities and states. The U.S. witnessed about 20,000 to 30,000 new cases every day in the month of April, suggesting the country is stuck in its peak.  Still, he remains optimistic that a vaccine will be ready within an historically short time frame, citing one promising candidate that he thinks may move into advanced clinical trials by the early summer. Fauci has said that he thinks a final vaccine could be available for general use as early as January, which would break records for the speed at which previous vaccines were developed.  5:03  One reason for his confidence is the “impressive” results being seen now in animals tested with a vaccine candidate made by Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna Therapeutics, which brought it into human trials in a record 42 days. The candidate is what is known as an mRNA vaccine—a drug that uses snippets of a virus’s genetic material—rather than the dead or weakened virus itself—to build the proteins that trigger the body’s protective immune response.  To date, no type of mRNA vaccine has been licensed for use in humans, but Fauci believes there is great promise for this technology targeting the coronavirus, based in part on his experience developing treatments for HIV/AIDS in the 1980s and ‘90s.  “For some reason that we're still struggling with, the body does not make an adequate immune response to HIV,” he says. To fight off that virus, a vaccine has to work better than the body’s own natural response. By contrast, “it's obvious that many people make a very adequate immune response” to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the animal trials so far show that modest doses of the mRNA vaccine for coronavirus have also generated a strong immune response.  He adds that NIAID is still developing and supporting multiple vaccine efforts, in case those that go into trials soonest don’t ultimately prove safe and effective. “You want a lot of shots on goal. We want four or five candidates that we put out there all within a reasonable time,” he says.  Fauci told National Geographic he’s concerned about states rushing to reopen before their infection rates fall. He also shared how he manages the barrage of new scientific information being released about COVID-19, and how his family and faith keep him going despite his increasingly hectic schedule.  (The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.)  Fauci on the vaccine  You’ve been the NIAID director since 1984, witnessing dozens of disease outbreaks. One of the first was the HIV/AIDS epidemic. How does that experience compare with COVID-19?  One of the important advantages is what we call targeted drug development. Viruses cause disease by binding to receptors on cells in your body, be they in your upper airway or in your lung, in the case of COVID-19. They then replicate at a rapid rate that triggers a variety of pathogenic processes. Targeting drugs to interfere at one or more vulnerable sites within this replication cycle is something that we learned with HIV.  Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Bush presents the Presidential Medal of Freedom on June 19, 2008 to Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infections Diseases, in Bethesda, Maryland during ceremonies at the White House. The Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award, recognizes exceptional meritorious service. Photograph by Karen Bleier, AFP via Getty Images  SARS-CoV-2 [the virus that causes COVID-19] has the same sort of vulnerable points. We need to identify them and develop drugs, either alone or in combination, to block the replication.  Are there also lessons from HIV/AIDS that relate to developing a COVID-19 vaccine?  Vaccines are a bit different. We have a better chance of quickly getting, relatively speaking, a vaccine for the novel coronavirus than we did for HIV, because for some reason that’s still unknown the body does not make an adequate immune response to HIV.  We don't necessarily have that challenge with this coronavirus because it's obvious that many people make a very adequate immune response. They clear the virus, and they do well. As we know from the natural history of this disease, the majority of people actually either get well without any symptoms—they're called asymptomatic—or they have minimal symptoms, where they get a fever, some aches, and then they recover.  The fact that the majority of people can actually clear the virus is a very good sign for the feasibility of developing a vaccine.  The two most widely discussed vaccine candidates are an mRNA vaccine from Moderna, which reached human trials in a record 42 days, and Oxford University’s candidate, based on what’s known as a nonreplicating viral vector. Yet no vaccine based on these two technologies has ever been licensed for human use. What makes these two vaccines seem so promising, especially on this expedited timeline?  These vaccines are inducing, at least in animal models, really rather substantial immune responses, particularly the mRNA vaccine. When we look at the immune response that you can induce with a modest dose—one that's feasible to be translated into humans—and the amount of time it takes to get to that level of immunity, it is really quite impressive. It is also really easy to scale up with these two, in the sense of making a lot of doses pretty quickly. So you're right, they have not been approved, as many of the other vaccine platforms have, but the promise is great.  We at NIAID are either developing or supporting the development of multiple candidates. You want a lot of shots on goal. We want four or five candidates that we put out there all within a reasonable time—maybe June, July, or August—to get them into an advanced trial. The mRNA one is already well into phase one of clinical trials, and we're getting ready to go into phase two and three sometime in the early summer.  Fauci on reopening and masks  As states move to reopen businesses and warmer weather lures people outside, how concerned are you about a fresh spike in infections in the U.S.?  Take a look at the guidelines for Opening Up America Again. There are very well delineated checkpoints. There's a gateway where infections must go down for 14 days before you can enter into phase one for reopening. If you fulfill the requirements of phase one, you move to phase two. If you do it there, you go to phase three.  So when you see somebody in an environment in which the infections are not going down, and then you see 30 to 40 people on a beach with no mask … well that's very nice to have fun in the sun, but you're really putting yourself and everyone at risk for creating an even bigger spike in infections.  Do you fear a second wave?  What’s impressed me the most—but clearly in a disturbing way—is the extraordinary efficiency of how the virus spreads. It spreads so much more efficiently than influenza does. You see situations where people at home try and physically separate; they have no contact except they've touched the plate or a doorknob, and they wind up getting infected.  The clusters in families, the outbreaks on the Teddy Roosevelt aircraft carrier, the enormous spread on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama harbor—it’s a very, very transmissible virus.  Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.  We're going to be put to the test as we move toward the fall and winter of this year. If we do it correctly, then we could be able to blunt and diminish the daily rate of infections in this country as we get into the summer. I can't guarantee it, but if we do things right, that likely will happen.  But I don't think there's a chance that this virus is just going to disappear. It's going to be around, and if given the opportunity, it will resurge. We now will have a few months—May June, July, August—to prepare, by making sure our health system is adequately supplied with ventilators, ICU beds, personal protective equipment, etcetera. We need to not only have tests, but to make sure the people who need tests can get tested.  So that by the time we get to September, we don't have the dialogue continually fixating on do you have enough tests? Shame on us if we don't have enough tests by the time this so-called return might occur in the fall and winter.  What’s your position on the general public wearing face masks?  I'm glad you asked, because it has evolved over the weeks and months. When there was first discussion, it was at a time when face masks—either surgical masks or N95 respirators—were at high scarcity.  Let's assume that we now have enough masks or that you could easily make a cloth covering, as was suggested appropriately by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I think those are reasonable assumptions. We know that the masks are better in the health-care setting to prevent someone who's infected from coughing and sneezing and infecting people in the environment. When you look at what the mask does for the general population, the data are not 100 percent: It doesn't 100 percent protect you from infecting somebody else, and it certainly doesn't 100 percent prevent somebody else from infecting you.  But if you wear a mask, you are getting some protection for yourself, and if you happen to be infected and don't know it, you're to some extent preventing transmission to someone else. Given that, it just makes sense that first of all, the best way to prevent spread is to maintain the physical distance of six feet.  So, if you're in a situation where you're in contact with no one, then you don't have to be walking around with a mask all day, that's for sure. But if you are in a situation where you are going to be within the realm of six feet—the grocery store or even walking out on the street—then wear it.  Fauci on the information deluge and the “virus made in Chinese lab” claim.  How do you keep up with the barrage of information and filter down to the most important science?  It's like drinking from a fire hydrant. It really is. Fortunately for me, I have a staff of three to four really good people who sift through the papers and when something looks unreasonable or “pie in the sky,” they don't bother me with that. Then when all of these studies come across my desk, I read the title and the abstract. If it looks feasible, I'll put it aside and try and read it. When it's something that they think I should read, they make sure I read it.  Even with that screening process, it's still very difficult to consume everything that's out there, particularly with this relatively recent trend with these non-peer-reviewed, pre-publications [that have not gone through traditional vetting to appear in major journals].  So, what's your advice to the public at-large for sifting through the headlines and making sense of it all?  Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.  Anybody can claim to be an expert even when they have no idea what they're talking about—and it's very difficult for the general public to distinguish. So, make sure the study is coming from a reputable organization that generally gives you the truth—though even with some reputable organizations, you occasionally get an outlier who's out there talking nonsense. If something is published in places like New England Journal of Medicine, Science, Nature, Cell, or JAMA—you know, generally that is quite well peer reviewed because the editors and the editorial staff of those journals really take things very seriously.  One topic in the news lately has been the origins of SAR-CoV-2. Do you believe or is there evidence that the virus was made in the lab in China or accidentally released from a lab in China?  If you look at the evolution of the virus in bats, and what's out there now is very, very strongly leaning toward this [virus] could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated—the way the mutations have naturally evolved. A number of very qualified evolutionary biologists have said that everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that it evolved in nature and then jumped species.  Sure, but what if scientists found the virus outside the lab, brought it back, and then it escaped?  But that means it was in the wild to begin with. That's why I don't get what they're talking about [and] why I don't spend a lot of time going in on this circular argument.  Fauci’s life right now  What’s your typical day like?  I get up around five o'clock in the morning, and I usually wind up running downstairs, getting a quick breakfast, and looking at a thousand emails—literally a thousand.  I then head to the NIH [National Institutes of Health] for my day job—trying to develop a vaccine and drugs and running a $6 billion institution. I stay there until around one o'clock, and then I go down to the White House for multiple meetings. First, I meet with the doctor group—myself, coronavirus response coordinator Debbie Birx, director Bob Redfield from the CDC, commissioner Steve Hahn from FDA, and others. We then go into the task force meeting run by Vice President [Mike Pence], which usually lasts about an hour and a half. We summarize this pre-brief with the vice president and then go brief President [Donald Trump] for the press conference.  Then, the work starts … I head home or back to the NIH and work until the wee hours of the morning. The whole day is punctuated by everybody needing to talk to you: every governor in the states, every congressional leader, every leader in the White House. It's constant conference calls. It's an almost impossible situation—and that's seven days a week.  Then you superimpose upon that all the press you do—the TV or the radio or the interviews. It's kind of a surrealistic state. I have to wake up in the morning and literally, without being facetious, ask my wife, what day is it?  Wow, how do you unwind?  I power walk with my wife, usually at night or on the weekends. It's dark, but we still do it anyway.  Has it ever been too taxing?  A couple of months ago, I was foolish and just thought I could get away with almost no sleep. I mean, like three hours a night. I did that for a few weeks, and it almost killed me. It really wore me down badly. Thank goodness I have a very intelligent and clinically skilled wife who turned things around and said, You got to remember to eat, and you've got to remember to sleep. The day is still impossible, but I don't think I'm going to drop dead from it. I hope not.  You went to a Jesuit high school, where you learned the importance of doing good for the public. How has that experience informed your professional life?  My whole life was almost served to me on the basis that my mother and father were very much oriented toward service. They were never really interested in money or material things. That's just the way they were, both of them. So I never knew there was anything like going out there and making a lot of money, and that was really cemented when I went both to a Jesuit high school and a Jesuit college, where the entire theme was service for others.  I almost never had any other inkling of doing anything except something that would have a public service component to it. I'm very much of a people person, but I'm also scientifically inclined. My entire training is steeped in the humanities, and when you combine that with an aptitude for science, you wind up being a physician.",true/false
40,"Pilot Nicholas Synnott spoke to ABC 30 after being leaving a Texas hospital in December 2020. (ABC 30)  A British Airways pilot who spent a record 243 days in a hospital in Texas while suffering from Covid-19 before returning home, has died in a hospital in the UK.  Nicholas Synnott, 60, was a father of two who was infected with the virus more than a year ago while flying between London and Houston. He died last week, MailOnline reported.  Mr Synnott was admitted to a hospital in Houston in March 2020. The cause of his death remains unclear, but it’s probable that his death was related to the aftermath of surviving Covid-19 as doctors have said that his organs suffered severe damage as a result of the virus.  Houston Doctor Bindu Akkanti said it was remarkable that Mr Synnott managed to get out of the American hospital as he was comatose and went through several organ failures.  Mr Synnott is survived by his wife Nicola, 54, a school administrator, and his two children, charity worker Rebecca, 24, and George, 21, who is in training to also be a pilot, MailOnline reported.  Captain Al Bridger, director of flight operations at British Airways, said: “We are devastated by this incredibly sad news. Nick was a valued member of our pilot family and a friend to many at the airline. Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this extremely difficult time.”  The family of Mr Synnott have asked those who want to support the family to donate to the charity where his daughter works, The Children’s Trust. The charity supports children with brain injuries.  “Nick was a much-loved husband, father, brother, uncle and friend. He will be dearly missed by all that knew him,” a fundraising page said.  “In lieu of flowers, please make a donation on Nick’s behalf to The Children's Trust, where Rebecca (Nick's daughter) works,” the message continued.  During his illness, Mr Synnott was on a ventilator after suffering respiratory failure. He was later treated using a heart and lung machine, according to doctors.  After leaving the hospital in Houston, Mr Synnott told ABC 30: “My temperature was spiking over 100 degrees... then I went through sort of a dark phase where psychologically there were issues I had to come to terms with.”  Story continues  “Every organ of his body was affected by Covid-19,” Dr Biswajit Kar told ABC 30. “But yet, because his health was so good as a pilot prior to the illness, he could sustain all this and survive something as serious as this. We were firstly overwhelmed by the joy that someone this sick could make it.”  When asked how Mr Synnott managed to survive, Dr Akkanti credited his wife, who was at his bedside every day for almost eight months.  “There was always a question, ‘Is he even in there?’ Given the enormous number of... medications [and] the other multi-organ issues that were happening. I think all of us on our team agreed that it was his wife,” Dr Akkanti said.  Mr Synnott told ABC 30 in December 2020 that he managed to get through the eight-month hospital stay “with the support of my wife, and the thought of going back to my kids. It was a tough journey but, we’ve got where we are”.

41,"By Edward Spalton. This article irst appeared in the Derby Evening Telegraph on 10th October  Mr Cameron is, of course, quite right that the European Convention on Human Rights ECHR has been expanded to a parody of its original laudable intentions.  It once took many thousands of pounds from public funds to pay a lawyer, Cherie Blair, to take a case on behalf of a schoolgirl who did not want to wear her school uniform.  As long as he keeps us in the EU, Mr Cameron cannot get us out of obeying the ECHR.  In 2011, the EU Commission a separate body wrote: “Respect for fundamental rights as guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights is an explicit obligation for the Union under article 6 3 of the Treaty on European Union… i.e., the Lisbon Treaty. …. The Court of Justice of the EU has held that the Convention is of special importance for determining the fundamental rights that must be respected by the member states.”  So, if Mr Cameron does run away from the European Court of Human Rights, the EU’s own Court of Justice will drag him back and compel his obedience to it. That is in the Lisbon Treaty, which is our country’s supreme constitution, overriding the Magna Carta, Queen, Lords and Commons as long as we remain in the EU. It is the same treaty on which “Cast Iron Cameron” promised us a referendum.",true/false
42,"The father of the Honduran girl who became the face of the family separation crisis has revealed that he still has not been in touch with his wife or daughter but was happy to learn they are safe. Denis Javier Varela Hernandez, 32, said that he had not heard from his wife Sandra, 32, who was with his two-year-old daughter Yanela Denise, for nearly three weeks until he saw the image of them being apprehended in Texas. In an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com, Hernandez, who lives in Puerto Cortes, Honduras, says that he was told on Wednesday by a Honduran official in the US that his wife and child are being detained at a family residential center in Texas but are together and are doing 'fine.' 'You can imagine how I felt when I saw that photo of my daughter. It broke my heart. It's difficult as a father to see that, but I know now that they are not in danger. They are safer now than when they were making that journey to the border,' he said. Denis said his wife and daughter were never separated by border control agents and remain together. Denis Javier Varela Hernandez (far right) spoke out about his wife Sandra and daughter, Yanela Two-year-old Yanela, a Honduran asylum seeker, has become the face of the child separation crisis after she was photographed crying in McAllen, Texas, as Border Control agents searched her mother A spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has told DailyMail.com that Sandra had been previously been deported from the US in 2013. The spokeswoman said that she was 'encountered by immigration officials in Hebbronville, Texas' in and sent back to Honduras 15 days later under 'expedited removal.' Sandra current immigration proceedings are 'ongoing' and she is being housed at a family detention center in Texas. Denis said that his wife had previously mentioned her wish to go to the United States for a 'better future' but did not tell him nor any of their family members that she was planning to make the trek. 'I didn't support it. I asked her, why? Why would she want to put our little girl through that? But it was her decision at the end of the day.' He said that Sandra had always wanted to experience 'the American dream' and hoped to find a good job in the States. Denis, who works as a captain at a port on the coast of Puerto Cortes, explained that things back home were fine but not great, and that his wife was seeking political asylum. He said that Sandra set out on the 1,800-mile journey with the baby girl on June 3, at 6am, and he has not heard from her since. 'I never got the chance to say goodbye to my daughter and now all I can do is wait', he said, adding that he hopes they are either granted political asylum or are sent back home. Yanela's father, Denis Javier Varela Hernandez (left), said that he had not heard from his daughter Yanela, one year and 11 months, and his wife for a month until he saw the image of them being apprehended Denis says that he has not spoken to his wife or daughter since they left for their journey from Puerto Cortes, Honduras, to the US on June 3 Above Sandra and little Yanela are seen being detained by US Border Patrol agents 'I don't have any resentment for my wife, but I do think it was irresponsible of her to take the baby with her in her arms because we don't know what could happen.' The couple has three other children, son Wesly, 14, and daughters Cindy, 11, and Brianna, six. 'The kids see what's happening. They're a little worried but I don't try to bring it up that much. They know their mother and sister are safe now.' Denis said that he believes the journey across the border is only worth it to some degree, and admits that it's not something he would ever consider. He said he heard from friends that his wife paid $6,000 for a coyote - a term for someone who smuggles people across the border. 'I wouldn't risk my life for it. It's hard to find a good job here and that's why many people choose to leave. But I thank God that I have a good job here. And I would never risk my life making that journey.' The heart-breaking photo was taken by Getty photographer John Moore close to midnight on the night of June 12 near McAllen, Texas, as the row over Donald Trump's separation of migrant parents and children escalated. Denis said that he hopes to use the photo and his family's situation to help him reunite with his daughter. 'I don't want money, what I want is someone to tell me that my daughter is going to be OK.' When asked about his views on Trump's border policy, Denis said: 'I've never seen it in a positive light the way others do. It violates human rights and children's rights. Separating children from their parents is just wrong. They are suffering and are traumatized. 'The laws need to be modified and we need to have a conversation. It's just not right. '[Illegal] Immigration and drug smuggling across the United States border is never gonna stop. They can build a wall and it's never going to stop,' he said. Sandra was part of a group that were caught by Border Patrol agents after making their way across the Rio Grande river on a raft. Hernandez's wife was part of a group that were caught by Border Patrol agents after making their way across the Rio Grande river on a raft. Hernandez said that he had heard through family members that his wife and daughter had not actually been separated Hernandez's daughters, Cindy, Yanela, and Brianna Moore's photo showed Yanela crying on a dirt track as her mother is patted down by a Border Patrol agent. For many the photo summed up the cruelty of Trump's 'zero tolerance' policy towards migrants which has caused 2,300 children to be separated from their mothers and fathers. A photo of Yanela was used on the front cover of TIME magazine to show the devastating effect of the policy, which was brought in in April. TIME magazine's July 2 cover features Yanela crying and looking up at President Donald Trump. The cover reads: 'Welcome to America' But actually Yanela remained with her mother after she arrived in the US after making the perilous 1,800 mile journey North through Central America and Mexico, TIME magazine later issued a clarification saying that the original version of its story accompanying the cover was wrong because Yanela ‘was not carried away screaming by Border Patrol Agents’. TIME’s editor in chief Edward Felsenthal said in a statement that it stood behind the wider point which is that Yanela was ‘the most visible symbol of the ongoing immigration debate’ Among those who have Tweeted DailyMail.com’s story have been White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. She wrote: ‘It’s shameful that dems and the media exploited this photo of a little girl to push their agenda. She was not separated from her mom. The separation here is from the facts’. Moore, who has worked on the border with Mexico for years and has won a Pulitzer for his photography, has said the the image of Yanela was the last one he took that night. Speaking to People magazine he said that the girl's mother was the last to be searched and a female agent asked her to put Yanela down so she could pat her down. Hernandez said that he wanted his wife and daughter to come home and that he would welcome them when they return Hernandez said that Yanela (center in her mother's arms) is the youngest of four children and she was the only one that traveled with her mother, a decision that surprised him Moore said: 'The mother hesitated and then set down the little girl and the child immediately started crying. ‘As a father, it was very emotional for me just to hear those cries. When I saw this little girl break down in tears I wanted to comfort this child. 'But as a photojournalist we sometimes have to keep photographing when things are hard. And tell a story that people would never see.' Moore crouched 6ft from the girl as she looked up at her mother and took seven shots, Yanela's mother's hands spread out on the Border Patrol truck. The image was a major factor in pressuring Trump to do a U-turn on his immigration policy and sign an executive order allowing families to stay together. The President said that he wanted to look strong but admitted that the 'zero tolerance' policy made him look like he had 'no heart'. Trump's climb down came after worldwide outrage including British Prime Minister Theresa May who called his policy 'deeply disturbing' while Pope Francis said it was 'immoral'. The climb down was a rare one from Trump, who almost never apologizes and rarely backs down. But he had not choice when his policy created a wall of opposition between him and others, including his own wife Melania, Democrats, Republicans, every living former First Lady, Amnesty International and the United Nations.

43,"Donald Trump is a man consumed with grievance against people he believes have betrayed him, but few betrayals have enraged him more than what his attorney general did to him. To Trump, the unkindest cut of all was when William Barr stepped forward and declared that there had been no widespread fraud in the 2020 election, just as the president was trying to overturn Joe Biden’s victory by claiming that the election had been stolen.  In a series of interviews with me this spring, Barr spoke, for the first time, about the events surrounding his break with Trump. I have also spoken with other senior officials in the Trump White House and Justice Department, who provided additional details about Barr’s actions and the former president’s explosive response. Barr and those close to him have a reason to tell his version of this story. He has been widely seen as a Trump lackey who politicized the Justice Department. But when the big moment came after the election, he defied the president who expected him to do his bidding.  Barr’s betrayal came on December 1, over lunch in the attorney general’s private dining room with Michael Balsamo, a Justice Department beat reporter at the Associated Press. Also in attendance were the DOJ chief of staff, Will Levi, and spokesperson Kerri Kupec. Balsamo was not told the reason for the invitation. When Barr dropped his bombshell between bites of salad, he mumbled, and Balsamo wasn’t sure that he had caught what the attorney general had said.  “Just to be crystal clear,” Balsamo asked, “are you saying—”  “Sir, I think you better repeat what you just said,” Kupec interjected.  “To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election,” Barr repeated. This time Balsamo heard him.  David A. Graham: Trump’s coup attempt didn’t start on January 6  Balsamo’s story appeared on the AP newswire shortly after lunch ended: “Disputing Donald Trump’s persistent baseless claims, Attorney General William Barr declared Tuesday the U.S. Justice Department had uncovered no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could change the outcome of the 2020 election.”  The story blew a hole in the president’s claims. Nobody seriously questioned Barr’s conservative credentials or whether he had been among Trump’s most loyal Cabinet secretaries. His conclusion sent a definitive message that the effort to overturn the election was without merit.  Barr told me that Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell had been urging him to speak out since mid-November. Publicly, McConnell had said nothing to criticize Trump’s allegations, but he told Barr that Trump’s claims were damaging to the country and to the Republican Party. Trump’s refusal to concede was complicating McConnell’s efforts to ensure that the GOP won the two runoff elections in Georgia scheduled for January 5.  To McConnell, the road to maintaining control of the Senate was simple: Republicans needed to make the argument that with Biden soon to be in the White House, it was crucial that they have a majority in the Senate to check his power. But McConnell also believed that if he openly declared Biden the winner, Trump would be enraged and likely act to sabotage the Republican Senate campaigns in Georgia. Barr related his conversations with McConnell to me. McConnell confirms the account.  “Look, we need the president in Georgia,” McConnell told Barr, “and so we cannot be frontally attacking him right now. But you’re in a better position to inject some reality into this situation. You are really the only one who can do it.”  “I understand that,” Barr said. “And I’m going to do it at the appropriate time.”  On another call, McConnell again pleaded with Barr to come out and shoot down the talk of widespread fraud.  “Bill, I look around, and you are the only person who can do it,” McConnell told him.  Levi, the Justice Department chief of staff, had also been urging Barr to contradict Trump’s assertions. But Barr had said nothing publicly to indicate that he disagreed with the president about the election. In fact, the week after the election, he gave prosecutors the green light to investigate “substantial allegations” of vote irregularities that “could potentially impact the outcome” of the election. The move overturned long-standing policy that the Justice Department does not investigate voter fraud until after an election is certified. The theory behind the policy is that the department’s responsibility is to prosecute crimes, not to get involved in election disputes. Barr’s reversal of the policy was interpreted by some as a sign that he might use the department to help Trump overturn the election.  Donald Ayer: Bill Barr’s unconstitutional campaign to reelect the president  But Barr told me he had already concluded that it was highly unlikely that evidence existed that would tip the scales in the election. He had expected Trump to lose and therefore was not surprised by the outcome. He also knew that at some point, Trump was going to confront him about the allegations, and he wanted to be able to say that he had looked into them and that they were unfounded. So, in addition to giving prosecutors approval to open investigations into clear and credible allegations of substantial fraud, Barr began his own, unofficial inquiry into the major claims that the president and his allies were making.  “My attitude was: It was put-up or shut-up time,” Barr told me. “If there was evidence of fraud, I had no motive to suppress it. But my suspicion all the way along was that there was nothing there. It was all bullshit.”  The Department of Justice ended up conducting no formal investigations of voter fraud, but as part of Barr’s informal review, he asked the U.S. Attorney in Michigan about Trump’s claim that mysterious “ballot dumps” in Detroit had secured Biden’s victory in the state.  As proof of fraud, Trump’s allies had pointed to videos showing boxes filled with ballots arriving at the TCF Center, in Detroit, to be counted after the 8 p.m. deadline for votes to be cast. But Barr quickly found that there was a logical explanation. It had to do with how the 662 precincts in Wayne County, home to Detroit, tabulate their votes. “In every other county, they count the ballots at the precinct, but in Wayne County, they bring them into one central counting place. So the boxes are coming in all night. The fact that boxes are coming in—well, that’s what they do.”  Furthermore, Trump performed better against Biden in Detroit than he had against Hillary Clinton in 2016. Biden received 1,000 fewer votes in Detroit than Clinton had, and Trump received 5,000 more votes than he had four years earlier. Trump didn’t lose Michigan because of “illegal” ballots cast in Detroit. He lost Michigan because Biden beat him badly in the suburbs.  Barr also looked into allegations that voting machines across the country were rigged to switch Trump votes to Biden votes. He received two briefings from cybersecurity experts at the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI. “We realized from the beginning it was just bullshit,” Barr told me, noting that even if the machines somehow changed the count, it would show up when they were recounted by hand. “It’s a counting machine, and they save everything that was counted. So you just reconcile the two. There had been no discrepancy reported anywhere, and I’m still not aware of any discrepancy.”  After the lunch with Balsamo, Barr and Levi went to the White House for a previously scheduled meeting with Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. After talking briefly with Meadows, they went upstairs to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone’s office. As they were conferring, one of the counsel’s aides knocked on the door and told Cipollone that the president wanted to see him and then, pointing to Barr, the aide said, “And he is looking for you.”  Barr, Levi, and Cipollone walked to the president’s personal dining room near the Oval Office. Trump was sitting at the table. Meadows was sitting next to him with his arms crossed; the White House adviser Eric Herschmann stood off to the side. The details of this meeting were described to me by several people present. One told me that Trump had “the eyes and mannerism of a madman.”  He went off on Barr.  “I think you’ve noticed I haven’t been talking to you much,” Trump said to him. “I’ve been leaving you alone.”  Barr later told others that the comment was reminiscent of a line in the movie Dr. Strangelove, in which the main character, Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper, says, “I do not avoid women, Mandrake, but I do deny them my essence.” Trump, Barr thought, was saying that he had been denying him his essence.  Trump brought up Barr’s AP interview.  “Did you say that?”  “Yes,” Barr responded.  “How the fuck could you do this to me? Why did you say it?”  “Because it’s true.”  The president, livid, responded by referring to himself in the third person: “You must hate Trump. You must hate Trump.”  Read: How Trump could attempt a coup  Barr thought that the president was trying to control himself, but he seemed angrier than he had ever seen him. His face was red. Barr’s AP interview was dominating every cable news channel except the one Trump was watching. The television in the room was tuned to the right-wing, pro-Trump network One America News, which was broadcasting a committee hearing of the Michigan legislature. The hearing featured disproven allegations of massive election fraud, including the testimony of a woman named Melissa Carone, who had worked at the counting location in Detroit and told the committee, “Everything that happened at the TCF Center was fraud. Every single thing.” The next day, Carone would testify again, next to Rudy Giuliani, during which time she slurred her words and appeared to be drunk. (Carone later denied that she had been drunk.)  “They saw the boxes going in!” Trump yelled, referring to the stories about boxes of illegal ballots being counted.  “You know, Mr. President, there are 662 precincts in Wayne County,” Barr said. Trump seemed taken aback that he knew the exact number. “It’s the only county with all the boxes going to a central place, and you actually did better there this time around than you did last time. You keep on saying that the Department of Justice is not looking at this stuff, and we are looking at it in a responsible way. But your people keep on shoveling this shit out.”  As Trump ranted about other examples of fraud, Meadows continued to sit silently with his arms crossed, his posture suggesting that he, too, was upset by what Barr had done.  “You know, you only have five weeks, Mr. President, after an election to make legal challenges,” Barr said. “This would have taken a crackerjack team with a really coherent and disciplined strategy. Instead, you have a clown show. No self-respecting lawyer is going anywhere near it. It’s just a joke. That’s why you are where you are.”  Interestingly, Trump didn’t argue when Barr told him that his “clown show” legal team had wasted time. In fact, he said, “You may be right about that.”  After going through his litany of claims—stolen ballots, fake ballots, dead people voting, rigged voting machines—Trump switched to other grievances, shouting at Barr for failing to prosecute Biden’s son Hunter. “If that had been one of my kids, they would have been all over him!” he said. By the end of the meeting, Trump was doing almost all of the talking. Why hadn’t Barr released John Durham’s report on the origins of the Russia investigation before the election? Why hadn’t he prosecuted former FBI Director James Comey? Trump was banging on the table. He said that Barr had been worthless.  As Barr left, he was unsure whether he still had a job. Had Trump just fired him? And if not, shouldn’t he quit? Why remain attorney general after what the president had just said to him? His status had been left up in the air.  The next morning, Barr received a call from Meadows. “I think there’s a way through this,” Meadows told him. He could prevent Trump from firing him, but he wanted an assurance from Barr that he wouldn’t resign. “Are you willing to stay?” Meadows asked.  “I’m not going to sandbag you,” Barr said. “I will give you a warning if I’m going to leave, and No. 2, I’ll stay as long as I’m needed.”  Barr almost immediately began to regret his decision to stay. His statement on election fraud did nothing to deter Trump, who was now listening, almost exclusively, to Giuliani and others outside his administration. They were telling him that he was still going to win the election.  Two weeks later, Barr went down to the White House to tell the president that he planned to resign before the end of the year. It was their first meeting since their confrontation. To defuse the tension, Barr had written an effusive resignation letter, which he handed to the president when he got to the Oval Office. The letter praised Trump’s record and played directly into his complaints about how he had been treated by Democrats, saying his efforts “had been met by a partisan onslaught against you in which no tactic, no matter how abusive and deceitful, was out of bounds.”  Trump read the letter while Barr was sitting across from him. “This is pretty good,” he said.",true/false
44,"DENVER—Colorado’s governor signed bills Wednesday that place new restrictions on firearms, signaling a change for Democrats who have traditionally shied away from gun control in a state with a pioneer tradition of gun ownership and self-reliance.  The legislation thrust Colorado into the national spotlight as a potential test of how far the country might be willing to go with new gun restrictions after the horror of mass killings at an Aurora movie theater and a Connecticut elementary school.  Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper signed bills that require background checks for private and online gun sales and ban ammunition magazines that hold more than 15 rounds.  The debate in the Democratic-controlled Legislature was intense, and Republicans warned that voters would make Democrats pay. The bills failed to garner a single Republican vote.  The bills’ approval came exactly eight months after dozens of people were shot in Aurora, and a day after the executive director of the state Corrections Department, Tom Clements, was shot and killed at his home. Hickenlooper signed the legislation right after speaking with reporters about Clements’ slaying.  Hickenlooper said large-capacity magazines “have the potential to turn killers into killing machines.” He also said he realized some gun owners may be inconvenienced but that “the potential for damage seems to outweigh, significantly, the inconvenience that people would have,” he said.  The bills signal a historic change for Democrats in a state where owning a gun is as common as owning a car in some rural areas.  “He just slapped rural Colorado right in the face,” said Republican Sen. Brophy, who represents an eastern plains district. “They are overwhelmingly upset about this.”  Both bills take effect July 1. People who currently own larger-capacity magazines will be able to keep them.  At the signing ceremony, Hickenlooper was surrounded by lawmakers who sponsored the bills, and relatives of mass shootings. Hickenlooper also signed requiring buyers to pay fees for background checks.  Each time he signed a bill, applause erupted from lawmakers and their guests, who included Jane Dougherty, whose sister was killed in the attack at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn.; Sandy Phillips, whose daughter was killed in Aurora; and Tom Mauser, whose son was killed in the 1999 Columbine shooting in Colorado.  Phillips, who lost daughter Jessica Ghawi, reminded Hickenlooper that it was the eight-month anniversary of the theater rampage.  “You’ve given us a real gift today,” she told the governor.  Later, Phillips added: “Thank you so much. You’re leading the entire country.”  Dougherty thanked Hickenlooper with tears in her eyes. Mauser also expressed gratitude.  “I knew it would be a long haul,” he said. “But I had faith in the people of Colorado.”  Democratic Rep. Rhonda Fields, who represents the district that includes the Aurora theater, said the governor had signed “common-sense legislation.”  “Gun violence is a problem nationwide, and sadly in the state of Colorado, we are all too familiar with some of these tragedies,” Fields.  Lawmakers debated firearms proposals after the Columbine High School shooting, and began requiring background checks for buyers at gun shows. But nothing they did then was as sweeping as the proposals they took up this year.  This year, Colorado lawmakers succeeded while members of their party stumbled in other states.  Washington state’s Democrat-controlled House failed this month to pass a universal background check bill. A bill requiring background checks at gun shows in New Mexico also stalled in that Democrat-led Legislature.  Republicans have warned that voters will punish Hickenlooper and other Democrats who voted in favor of the measures.  “The real solution here is at the ballot box in 2014,” Brophy said.  Republicans have said limiting magazine sizes will drive jobs from the state, and ultimately won’t prevent criminals from getting larger magazines in other states.  One Colorado-based manufacturer of ammunition magazines disclosed plans to relocate because of the new restrictions.  Police chiefs in urban areas supported the bills, but some rural county sheriffs opposed the new background checks, arguing the move is unenforceable and endangers Second Amendment rights.  Hickenlooper said law enforcement should try to find common ground.  “This shouldn’t be rural versus urban. We are one state,” he said.  ———  Associated Press writer Kristen Wyatt contributed to this report.  ———  Find Ivan Moreno on Twitter: http://twitter.com/IvanJourno",true/false
45,"This is the first of a two-part “Explained” on the scientific concepts underlying the concept of the greenhouse effect and global climate change.    When people talk about global warming or the greenhouse effect, the main underlying scientific concept that describes the process is radiative forcing. And despite all the recent controversy over leaked emails and charges of poorly sourced references in the last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, the basic concept of radiative forcing is one on which scientists — whatever their views on global warming or the IPCC — all seem to agree. Disagreements come into play in determining the actual value of that number.    The concept of radiative forcing is fairly straightforward. Energy is constantly flowing into the atmosphere in the form of sunlight that always shines on half of the Earth’s surface. Some of this sunlight (about 30 percent) is reflected back to space and the rest is absorbed by the planet. And like any warm object sitting in cold surroundings — and space is a very cold place — some energy is always radiating back out into space as invisible infrared light. Subtract the energy flowing out from the energy flowing in, and if the number is anything other than zero, there has to be some warming (or cooling, if the number is negative) going on.    It’s as if you have a kettle full of water, which is at room temperature. That means everything is at equilibrium, and nothing will change except as small random variations. But light a fire under that kettle, and suddenly there will be more energy flowing into that water than radiating out, and the water is going to start getting hotter.    In short, radiative forcing is a direct measure of the amount that the Earth’s energy budget is out of balance.    For the Earth’s climate system, it turns out that the level where this imbalance can most meaningfully be measured is the boundary between the troposphere (the lowest level of the atmosphere) and the stratosphere (the very thin upper layer). For all practical purposes, where weather and climate are concerned, this boundary marks the top of the atmosphere.    While the concept is simple, the analysis required to figure out the actual value of this number for the Earth right now is much more complicated and difficult. Many different factors have an effect on this balancing act, and each has its own level of uncertainty and its own difficulties in being precisely measured. And the individual contributions to radiative forcing cannot simply be added together to get the total, because some of the factors overlap — for example, some different greenhouse gases absorb and emit at the same infrared wavelengths of radiation, so their combined warming effect is less than the sum of their individual effects.    In its most recent report in 2007, the IPCC produced the most comprehensive estimate to date of the overall radiative forcing affecting the Earth today. Ronald Prinn, the TEPCO Professor of Atmospheric Science and director of MIT’s Center for Global Change Science, was one of the lead authors of that chapter of the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report. Radiative forcing “was very small in the past, when global average temperatures were not rising or falling substantially,” he explains. For convenience, most researchers choose a “baseline” year before the beginning of world industrialization — usually either 1750 or 1850 — as the zero point, and compute radiative forcing in relation to that base. The IPCC uses 1750 as its base year and it is the changes in the various radiative forcing agents since then that are counted.    Thus radiative forcing, measured in watts per square meter of surface, is a direct measure of the impact that recent human activities — including not just greenhouse gases added to the air, but also the impact of deforestation, which changes the reflectivity of the surface — are having on changing the planet’s climate. However, this number also includes any natural effects that may also have changed during that time, such as changes in the sun’s output (which has produced a slight warming effect) and particles spewed into the atmosphere from volcanoes (which generally produce a very short-lived cooling effect, or negative forcing).    Although all of the factors that influence radiative forcing have uncertainties associated with them, one factor overwhelmingly affects the uncertainty: the effects of aerosols (small airborne particles) in the atmosphere. That’s because these effects are highly complex and often contradictory. For example, bright aerosols (like sulfates from coal-burning) are a cooling mechanism, whereas dark aerosols (like black carbon from diesel exhausts) lead to warming. Also, adding sulfate aerosols to clouds leads to smaller but more abundant droplets that increase cloud reflectivity, thus cooling the planet.    “The error bars in the greenhouse gas forcing are very small,” Prinn says. “The biggest uncertainty in defining radiative forcing comes from aerosols.”    So, given all these factors and their range of errors, what’s the answer? The current level of radiative forcing, according to the IPCC AR4, is 1.6 watts per square meter (with a range of uncertainty from 0.6 to 2.4). That may not sound like much, Prinn says, until you consider the total land area of the Earth and multiply it out, which gives a total warming effect of about 800 terawatts — more than 50 times the world’s average rate of energy consumption, which is currently about 15 terawatts.    Part two of this series will examine the concept of climate sensitivity, which determines how much the planet’s temperature will change due to a given radiative forcing.",true/false
46,"It’s been more than a year since Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst lost his bid to become a U.S. senator, but his campaign still owes consultants and vendors nearly $1 million, Federal Election Commission records show. In a July filing, the Dewhurst For Texas federal campaign committee disclosed various “debts and obligations” owed to consultants and other service providers, including top Republican consultants Dave Carney, Mike Baselice and Jim Bognet. The unpaid bills range from several six-figure debts to media experts to a few hundred dollars owed to a company that provided email services. The total tab: $909,875.90, records indicate. Many of the vendors are upset about getting stiffed for thousands of dollars from the campaign of a multi-millionaire candidate like Dewhurst, who hasn’t hesitated to pour some of his vast wealthy into his political endeavors. In a written statement, Dewhurst spokesman Travis Considine pointed to the alleged embezzlement by former campaign manager Kenneth “Buddy” Barfield. Lawyers for Dewhurst's state and federal campaign committees have accused Barfield of stealing as much as $2 million from both his state and federal campaign coffers. According to news reports, both state and federal authorities are investigating the allegations, and Dewhurst’s two campaigns have filed a civil lawsuit to recover the funds. Barfield’s lawyer, Brian Casey, declined comment. “The Dewhurst state and federal committees have filed suit in Travis County district court and are vigorously pursuing recovery of all funds embezzled by Kenneth Barfield, including those that should have been used to pay any outstanding federal campaign obligations,” Considine told The Texas Tribune on Tuesday. That explanation didn’t soothe several of the vendors. Jeff Roe, owner of Missouri-based Candidate Command, which prepares and sends out direct mail advertisements, said he incurred postage and printing costs based on assurances from Dewhurst that he would be compensated for his services. Figures show Roe's company is still owed $134,343. “This is not some consultant fees, this is expended resources spent in the pursuit of election victory,” Roe said. “It’s clear he’s able to raise resources and pay these debts. The steps we took were on David’s word that we would be paid. That wasn’t some Buddy Barfield promise. That was David. It was based on David’s honor.” At least two of the consultants carrying the year-old debt have continued to work for Dewhurst, who is now engaged in a highly competitive race to keep his powerful job as lieutenant governor, which oversees proceedings in the Texas Senate. They are fundraiser Becca McMullen, owed $50,000 for a “fundraising consulting bonus,” and Ryan Gravatt, whose Internet services company, Raconteur Media, is owed $45,362 for website consulting and advertising, records show. “I’m working for David Dewhurst because I personally like him. He has integrity,” Gravatt said. “I’ve been told that this will be made right and I’ll be made whole, and I’m still hopeful that that will be the case.” McMullen was not available for comment, Considine said. A law firm providing legal services and a firm providing accounting services were the only creditors to whom the Dewhurst Senate campaign made any payments during the last reporting period, the report shows. The Dewhurst campaign previously refunded about $800,000 in contributions to donors who had given him money for a general election that never came, officials said. Dewhurst lost the GOP primary to Ted Cruz, now the state's junior U.S. senator. Here are some of the debts the Dewhurst Senate campaign still owes, according to the FEC: $170,628 to OnMessage, a media consulting and polling firm. The company, in which former Dewhurst consultant Brad Todd is a partner, also did work for Gov. Rick Perry ’s 2012 presidential campaign. $125,000 to Something Else Strategies, a national media consulting firm that does work for U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and others. $112,885 to former general consultant and strategist Jim Bognet, a former top campaign aide to Mitt Romney. $50,452 to Baselice & Associates. Mike Baselice, who has provided polling data to Perry and other Texas Republicans, was Dewhurst's pollster during the Senate race. $36,388 to Norway Hill, Carney’s consulting company. A longtime consultant to Perry, Carney is now a top consultant for Attorney General Greg Abbott , the frontrunner in the race to succeed Perry. $20,000 to John Doner & Associates, a well-known research firm based in Austin. The debts on the campaign reports for the top vendors reflect partial non-payment. All of them were paid previously for services rendered earlier in the campaign, records show. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, for example, OnMessage is listed as the recipient of some $7 million and Bognet is shown as having received $278,000. It’s not clear whether the billings listed on the website include any of the outstanding debts recorded in the July FEC report. Roe, who owns the direct mail company in Missouri, said even though it’s been a year, he remains optimistic that Dewhurst, who spent most of his life in the business world, will step in and settle the debts. “I continue to be hopeful that this will be resolved,"" he said.",true/false
47,"A chunk of floating ice that weighs more than a trillion metric tons broke away from the Antarctic Peninsula, producing one of the largest icebergs ever recorded and providing a glimpse of how the Antarctic ice sheet might ultimately start to fall apart. A crack more than 120 miles long had developed over several years in a floating ice shelf called Larsen C, and scientists who have been monitoring it confirmed on Wednesday that the huge iceberg had finally broken free. 100 MILES ANTARCTICA SOUTH PACIFIC OCEAN How the crack grew After accelerating across the Antarctic Peninsula, the direction of the crack sharply turned 90º in May. WEDDELL SEA Delaware to scale May 31 SOUTH ATLANTIC OCEAN May 1 ICEBERG Jan. 1, 2017 Shelf front June 2016 November 2010 NORTH PENINSULA GLACIERS LARSEN C ICE SHELF If Larsen C’s shelf front retreats past this line, called the compressive arch, the shelf is likely to collapse. SOUTH PENINSULA GLACIERS ANTARCTIC PENINSULA Composite image by The New York Times from NASA Blue Marble, NOAA and NASA CIMSS imagery There is no scientific consensus over whether global warming is to blame. But the landscape of the Antarctic Peninsula has been fundamentally changed, according to Project Midas, a research team from Swansea University and Aberystwyth University in Britain that had been monitoring the rift since 2014. “The remaining shelf will be at its smallest ever known size,” said Adrian Luckman, a lead researcher for Project Midas. “This is a big change. Maps will need to be redrawn.”
Thin sea ice Ice shelf 820 FEET DEEP 900 FEET Rift seen from space Beginning of rift about 40 miles from the edge 10 MILES Larsen C, like two smaller ice shelves that collapsed before it, was holding back relatively little land ice, and it is not expected to contribute much to the rise of the sea. But in other parts of Antarctica, similar shelves are holding back enormous amounts of ice, and scientists fear that their future collapse could dump enough ice into the ocean to raise the sea level by many feet. How fast this could happen is unclear. In the late 20th century, the Antarctic Peninsula, which juts out from the main body of Antarctica and points toward South America, was one of the fastest-warming places in the world. That warming had slowed or perhaps reversed slightly in the 21st century, but scientists believe the ice is still catching up to the higher temperatures. Some climate scientists believe the warming in the region was at least in part a consequence of human-caused climate change, while others have disputed that, seeing a large role for natural variability — and noting that icebergs have been breaking away from ice shelves for many millions of years. But the two camps agree that the breakup of ice shelves in the peninsula region may be a preview of what is in store for the main part of Antarctica as the world continues heating up as a result of human activity. “While it might not be caused by global warming, it’s at least a natural laboratory to study how breakups will occur at other ice shelves to improve the theoretical basis for our projections of future sea level rise,” said Thomas P. Wagner, who leads NASA’s efforts to study the polar regions. The time-lapse image below shows the rift gradually widening from late 2014 to January of this year. In frigid regions, ice shelves form as the long rivers of ice called glaciers flow from land into the sea. The result is a bit like a clog in a drain pipe, slowing the flow of the glaciers feeding them. When an ice shelf collapses, the glaciers behind it can accelerate, as though the drain pipe had suddenly cleared. At the remaining part of Larsen C, the edge is now much closer to a line that scientists call the compressive arch, which is critical for structural support. If the front retreats past that line, the northernmost part of the shelf could collapse within months. “At that point in time, the glaciers will react,” said Eric Rignot, a climate scientist at the University of California, Irvine, who has done extensive research on polar ice. “If the ice shelf breaks apart, it will remove a buttressing force on the glaciers that flow into it. The glaciers will feel less resistance to flow, effectively removing a cork in front of them.” Scientists also fear that two crucial anchor points will be lost. According to Dr. Rignot, the stability of the whole ice shelf is threatened, as the shelf front thins. “You have these two anchors on the side of Larsen C that play a critical role in holding the ice shelf where it is,” he said. “If the shelf is getting thinner, it will be more breakable, and it will lose contact with the ice rises.” Low shelf support High If the shelf front disconnects from the ice rises, a rapid retreat will be triggered.
SHELF FRONT Bawden Ice Rise Gipps Ice Rise ICE SHELF NORTH PENINSULA GLACIERS SOUTH PENINSULA GLACIERS Ice rises are islands that are overridden by the ice shelf, allowing them to shoulder more of the weight of the shelf. Scientists have yet to determine the extent of thinning around the Bawden and Gipps ice rises, though Dr. Rignot noted that the Bawden ice rise was more vulnerable. “We’re not even sure how it’s hanging on there,” he said. “But if you take away Bawden, the whole shelf will feel it.”
The Antarctic Peninsula may be a canary in a coal mine. The collapse of the peninsula’s ice shelves can be interpreted as fulfilling a prophecy made in 1978 by a renowned geologist named John H. Mercer of Ohio State University. In a classic paper, Dr. Mercer warned that the western part of Antarctica was so vulnerable to human-induced climate warming as to pose a “threat of disaster” from rising seas. He said that humanity would know the calamity had begun when ice shelves started breaking up along the peninsula, with the breakups moving progressively southward. The Larsen A ice shelf broke up over several years starting in 1995; the Larsen B underwent a dramatic collapse in 2002; and now, scientists fear, the calving of the giant iceberg could be the first stage in the breakup of Larsen C. “As climate warming progresses farther south,” Dr. Rignot said, “it will affect larger and larger ice shelves, holding back bigger and bigger glaciers, so that their collapse will contribute more to sea-level rise.” For more Times reporting on Antarctica, read the Antarctic Dispatches or watch four virtual-reality films in The Antarctica Series.",true/false
48,"The number of children being considered for adoption has plummeted by 24 per cent in a year, despite an increase in those taken into care, official figures show. Adoption placement orders, which mean children are ruled eligible to be adopted, fell to just 7,320 between March 2014 and March 2015, according to the Department for Education’s latest Looked After Children statistics. Those placed for adoption also fell by 15 per cent in 2015 to 3,320. 69,540 The total number of looked after children in the UK up to March 2015 The fall comes as more children are being taken into care than at any time since 1986. At the end of March this year there were 69,540 looked after children, an increase of 6 per cent compared to 31 March 2011. The majority of these children live in foster care. Javed Khan, chief executive of Barnardo’s, said: “We are deeply concerned about the drastic 24 per cent fall in the number of children being put forward for adoption. It’s crucial that local authorities don’t shy away from acting decisively. These can be tough decisions but the best interests of vulnerable children must be put first. This could very soon become a real crisis with children waiting an unnecessary length of time in care – or even missing out completely on the chance of their own loving, safe and supportive family.” Earlier this year The Independent revealed how a series of rulings in the family courts had sent adoption rates into freefall. The problems began in November 2013 when the President of the Family Court, Sir James Munby, made a ruling that left many local authorities convinced they must try every extended family member before putting a child up for adoption. Two further rulings in January slowed down the process further. Sir James granted an appeal in a case in Liverpool where three children were taken away from a mother with a history of drug and alcohol abuse who was given no opportunity to prepare a case. He ruled that the “ruthlessly truncated process” employed by the earlier judge in the case was “unprincipled and unfair”. A second case decided by Mr Justice Keehan ruled that Northamptonshire County Council had made “egregious failures” in its handling of the case of a baby taken into care without proper assessments of the mother or the maternal grandparents in Latvia, where the baby was eventually placed. Data released for the first time this year also showed that more than 6,000 children went missing from care in the year to March 2015. The DfE cautioned that this was “experimental” data since it was the first time it was collected.

50,"Colorado’s shrinking mountain snowpack — at 66 percent of normal statewide Thursday — forced an expanded federal drought designation covering nearly a quarter of the state with stream flows forecast at half of average, setting off a scramble to secure water supplies.  The scarcity spurred calls for storing more water in reservoirs to sustain the state’s growth boom.  “There’s going to be people without water,” especially in Southern Colorado, U.S. Department of Agriculture snow survey supervisor Brian Domonkos said. “It’s going to be a tight year.”  Denver Water officials planned to pull more of the H2O they deliver to 1.4 million metro residents from northern mountains because the upper South Platte River basin snowpack they rely on remains low. They’re seeking federal approval to expand storage by 77,000 acre-feet in Gross Reservoir west of Boulder, a controversial project.  State agencies, including Gov. John Hickenlooper’s staffers, have been monitoring drought impacts and weighing responses with an eye toward tapping federal drought funds. They also may activate a program to ensure sufficient stream flows for protecting imperiled fish.  “We’re very closely monitoring the situation for impacts to make decisions about what we need to do next,” said Colorado Water Conservation Board climate change specialist Taryn Finnessey.  “Water providers are concerned. Those who have more storage are in a better position than those who rely more on direct flows,” she said. “This is something everybody from the agency level up to the governor’s office is closely watching to make sure we are ready to respond.”  Federal snow-survey data showed paltry snowpack statewide and less than 50 percent of median in southern areas.This means less water will flow into streams and rivers as snow melts. Snowpack in the South Platte River basin crucial for Colorado agriculture measured 83 percent of the norm. Snowpack was at 77 percent in the upper Colorado River basin. And snowpack at 57 percent in the Arkansas River basin and 55 percent in the Gunnison River basin was the lowest in 38 years.  Stream and river flows across Colorado likely will diminish to about 50 percent of average, according to federal flow forecasts. While the peak spring runoff flows in the South Platte and Colorado river basins were expected to reach 80 percent of the norm, the federal forecasts indicated flows will be as low as 25 percent of average along the Gunnison and at reservoirs near Durango and Paonia.  Federal drought monitoring officials on Thursday expanded the extreme drought designations in southern Colorado to cover about 24 percent of the state. Counties adjacent to New Mexico now are eligible for federal drought aid. The drought index showed 90 percent of Colorado under abnormally dry conditions with 74 percent of the state designated in moderate to extreme drought.  For metro Denver residents, the low snowpack, about 70 percent of the norm at the south end of Denver Water’s collection system, which holds 90 percent of metro Denver’s water supply, means heavier than usual reliance on runoff water from northern areas, where snowpack is thicker.  That’s not ideal but will help ensure steady water, utility officials said, adding that stream flows this year may not be sufficient to fill reservoirs.  “This year’s imbalance underscores the need to expand Gross Reservoir, which is Denver Water’s major storage reservoir on the north end of our system,” said Denver Water chief executive Jim Lochhead. “The expansion will help to ensure we’re less vulnerable during years like this and better prepared for events like forest fires and infrastructure failures on the south.”  Northern Water officials who supply cities and farmers north of metro Denver were planning to draw down reservoirs, where they have saved up 25 percent more water than usual for this time of year.  “We’re better off than other parts of the state, but our snowpack is still 20 percent below normal,” said Northern Water spokesman Brian Werner. “How much precipitation are we going to get? Spring storms are going to make or break this season for us.”  “We will release water from our storage. That’s why you have storage. This year’s conditions really emphasize the value of storage. Down the road, this state is going to have to have additional storage. And we will have to reuse more water. And there will have to be increased conservation.”  More than 80 percent of the water that Colorado residents divert from streams and rivers is used to irrigate crops. People in urban areas use about 10 percent. The oil and gas industry uses less than half a percent for the hydraulic fracturing that speeds extraction of fossil fuels by injecting water, sand and chemicls underground.  That leaves diminishing water for aquatic life — especially during dry times.  Colorado officials have developed a program with the Colorado Water Trust to purchase water that farmers and cities with rights to water are entitled to divert and then leave that water in streams and rivers. The idea is to release flows from reservoirs strategically to benefit ecosystems when water flows otherwise could disappear.  “We have that option,” the Colorado Water Conservation Board’s Finnessey said. “It keeps more water in the rivers for environmental purposes and water rights holders are compensated. Higher flows help maintain healthy river ecosystems. The endangered fish species in Colorado are always a concern.”  Conservation groups back that effort and on Thursday raised concerns that near-record low snowpack in Colorado will lead to degraded fish habitat and warmer water temperatures.  “Colorado’s legislators and water leaders need to continue to develop tools that allow irrigators and other water users the flexibility to use water in creative ways, including leaving it in streams during dry years like this,” said Trout Unlimited director David Nickum.  “We’ll be depending on these programs more and more,” he said, “as rivers face pressure from growing demands, changing climate and droughts.”  UPDATED: This story was updated at 10:34 a.m. on April 6, 2018, to add context to a quote from U.S. Department of Agriculture snow survey supervisor Brian Domonkos.",true/false
51,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic. Some coronavirus victims could be temporarily buried in the Hart Island potter’s field — or even public parks — if New York’s morgues become overwhelmed by the number of dead, officials said Monday. They floated the heart-wrenching option as the city death toll climbed to 2,738 and the caseload hit 68,776 — accounting for more than half of the Empire State’s 4,758 fatalities and 130,689 cases. “We may well be dealing with temporary burials so we can deal with each family later,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio in a press briefing at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. “Obviously the place we have used historically is Hart Island.” Located in the Long Island Sound off The Bronx’s southeast coast, the desolate spit of land is the nation’s largest public burial ground, with a macabre history. It has hosted a Civil War prison camp, a colony for tuberculosis patients, and became the resting place for thousands of HIV/AIDS victims during the 1980s who were abandoned by families or unable to receive proper burials. De Blasio — who has been loath to publicly discuss how New York would handle the overwhelming body count — faced the ghastly reality after City Councilman Mark Levine raised an even more dire possibility. “Soon we’ll start ‘temporary interment.’ This likely will be done by using a NYC park for burials (yes you read that right),” the Manhattan Democrat tweeted prior to de Blasio’s remarks. “Trenches will be dug for 10 caskets in a line. “It will be done in a dignified, orderly — and temporary — manner. But it will be tough for NYers to take.” Levine, chair of the council’s Health Committee, clarified in a later tweet that the plan to convert parks into makeshift cemeteries was a “contingency,” and City Hall said it wasn’t happening — for now. “We are NOT currently planning to use local parks as burial grounds,” tweeted mayoral rep Freddi Goldstein. “We are exploring using Hart Island for temporary burials, if the need grows.” As New Yorkers were still dying by the hundreds, Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday again voiced guarded optimism that the wave may be cresting. After a record 630 deaths were logged Saturday, the number fell to 594 Sunday, and stayed “effectively flat” with 599 on Monday. “The flattening — possible flattening — of the curve is better than the increases that we have seen,” said Cuomo in his daily Albany press briefing. Longtime Cuomo aide Dr. Jim Malatras agreed that New York may be turning a corner. “This could suggest that we are indeed, potentially, at the apex,” said Malatras, while cautioning that this is far from over. “It looks like we are towards the earlier side of the projection.” If the disease is truly hitting its apex, it comes just in time for New York’s overtaxed hospitals. “This is a hospital system where we have our foot to the floor,” Cuomo said. “The engine is at redline, and you can’t go any faster. You can’t stay at redline for any period of time, because the system will blow.” To ease the pressure, President Trump on Monday granted Cuomo’s request for the hospital ship docked along Manhattan’s West Side — the USNS Comfort — to take on COVID-19 patients. The 1,000-bed vessel was originally reserved for non-coronavirus patients, but hadn’t seen many cases in the shut-down city. “That is a welcome relief,” Cuomo told MSNBC of the move.

Nearly half of voters 46% think Britain's economy would be weaker if the Labour leader replaced her in Downing Street while 43% think she is the right person for the job, according to the ComRes State-of-the-Nation poll for the Daily Express. And the Tories do not appear to have suffered any loss of popularity from the Windrush scandal that forced Amber Rudd to quit as Home Secretary earlier this week, the research shows. Labour and the Tories are level-pegging at 40% each in the poll, virtually unchanged from a previous survey before the scandal about the immigration status of Caribbean migrants and their descendants erupted. The poll findings are likely to cheer the Prime Minister and her team ahead of town hall elections in England on Thursday, the first electoral test for her Government since last year's general election. Theresa May's most powerful quotes Thu, August 31, 2017 Play slideshow Getty Images 1 of 8 'I will be ruthless in cutting out waste, streamlining structures and improving efficiency' With the Remainers becoming so intransigent, the Prime Minister may need to call their bluff by going to the country Minister Designed to give a snapshot of the nation's mood ahead of the local vote, the poll also found voters are upbeat about modern Britain and take particular pride in the country's Royal Family and NHS. Andrew Hawkins, ComRes Chairman, said: “That the two main parties are polling neck and neck despite Theresa May’s considerable lead over Jeremy Corbyn on economic management points either to voters being prepared to support a party that they believe will them poorer, or at election time they will instead opt for what they feel is the safer option. The danger for Labour is not just that there is a discrepancy, it is the scale of it, including among young people whose support is vital if the Party is to stand a chance of winning an election. The ComRes survey of more than 2,000 voters, conducted online last weekend, showed 47% of voters think international confidence in Britain's economy is stronger with Mrs May as Prime Minister than it would be under Mr Corbyn. Only 30% disagreed with the statement. GETTY The poll found that Brits take particular pride in the country's Royal Family It also found that Tory support was unchanged at 40% since a previous poll by the firm published in the Sunday Express on 13 April. Labour support was down by one point to 40% while the Lib Dems were up two points to 9%. Labour's failure to capitalise on the Government's recent rocky patch has led to a growing confidence in Tory ranks. Senior Conservatives believe Mr Corbyn's own troubles over allegations of anti-Semitism in his party and his refusal to back robust action against Russia and Syria is damaging his populist appeal. Some Brexit ministers are even understood to be pressing Theresa May to signal her readiness to call a snap general election as a threat to bring Brexit rebels into line. One minister told the Daily Express: With the Remainers becoming so intransigent, the Prime Minister may need to call their bluff by going to the country. The minister added: She may need to call a Brexit election to settle this once and for all. We need to make life uncomfortable for Remain-backing MPs who represent constituencies that voted leave. Labour would be slaughtered in its northern heartlands if the party backed staying in the customs union. It would be a complete betrayal of the referendum. GETTY 47% of voters think international confidence in UK's economy would be weaker under Jeremy Corbyn Other Tories were less enthusiastic about the election plan however. One senior backbencher said: An election now would be stupid. It didn't work last year and wouldn't work now. Mrs May tomorrow convenes a meeting of her Brexit sub-committee to discuss whether a controversial blueprint for a customs partnership should become the Government's preferred option in the negotiations with Brussels. Ministers are bitterly divided over the issue, with Brexit enthusiasts fearing the plan is an attempt to keep Britain tied into the customs union forever. One Whitehall source said: The committee is split down the middle and the decision could come down to a show of hands. Cabinet Brexiteers were furious after peers, including 19 rebel Tories, backed a rebel amendment seeking to give Parliament powers to reopen reject an EU exit deal and force the Government to reopen talks.

53,"“Obviously, a single year, even if it is a record, cannot tell us much about climate trends,” said Stefan Rahmstorf, head of earth system analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. “However, the fact that the warmest years on record are 2014, 2010 and 2005 clearly indicates that global warming has not ‘stopped in 1998,’ as some like to falsely claim.”  Such claims are unlikely to go away, though. John R. Christy, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville who is known for his skepticism about the seriousness of global warming, pointed out in an interview that 2014 had surpassed the other record-warm years by only a few hundredths of a degree, well within the error margin of global temperature measurements. “Since the end of the 20th century, the temperature hasn’t done much,” Dr. Christy said. “It’s on this kind of warmish plateau.”  Despite such arguments from a handful of scientists, the vast majority of those who study the climate say the earth is in a long-term warming trend that is profoundly threatening and caused almost entirely by human activity.  They expect the heat to get much worse over coming decades, but already it is killing forests around the world, driving plants and animals to extinction, melting land ice and causing the seas to rise at an accelerating pace.  “It is exceptionally unlikely that we would be witnessing a record year of warmth, during a record-warm decade, during a several decades-long period of warmth that appears to be unrivaled for more than a thousand years, were it not for the rising levels of planet-warming gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels,” Michael E. Mann, a climate scientist at the Pennsylvania State University, said in an email.  NASA and the other American agency that maintains long-term temperature records, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, issued separate data compilations on Friday that confirmed the 2014 record. A Japanese agency had released preliminary information in early January showing 2014 as the warmest year.  One more scientific group, in Britain, that curates the world’s temperature record is scheduled to report in the coming weeks.",true/false
54,"In the scramble to make sense of the post-inauguration world, Amazon has been forced to restock a few key titles: Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four hit No 1 at the end of last week, after Trump’s adviser Kellyanne Conway used the phrase “alternative facts” in place of “some bullshit I just made up”. But the surprise hit – being long, complex and demanding or, as the online magazine Jezebel described it, “extremely metal” – is Hannah Arendt’s The Origins of Totalitarianism, first published in 1951. Commentators have been referencing the work since Donald Trump’s election in November but rarely has this spurred so many people to actually buy a copy. In it, the political theorist (she always explicitly rejected the term “philosopher”) details the trajectory: “antisemitism (not merely hatred of Jews), imperialism (not merely conquest), totalitarianism (not merely dictatorship)” are considered in their interrelation. Against the necessary background of imperialism, “antisemitism became the catalytic agent first for the rise of the Nazi movement … then for a world war of unparalleled ferocity and, finally, for the emergence of the unprecedented crime of genocide”. That much is well established; the chill is in the detail. When she describes the rise of the dictator, which requires a mass not a mob, you could be reading a sociologist’s thesis about Trump supporters. “The term masses applies only where we deal with people who either because of sheer numbers, or indifference, or a combination of both, cannot be integrated into any organisation based on common interest, into political parties or municipal governments or professional organisations or trade unions. Potentially, they exist in every country and form the majority of those large numbers of neutral, politically indifferent people who never join a party and hardly ever go to the polls.” She describes, quite brusquely, antisemitism at its incipience: “Whereas anti-Jewish sentiments were widespread among the educated classes of Europe throughout the 19th century, antisemitism as an ideology remained, with very few exceptions, the prerogative of crackpots in general and the lunatic fringes in particular.” Yet however you dismissed their mental capacity, this hardcore created the ideological infrastructure on which a mass movement could be built. It is strikingly reminiscent of John Naughton’s description on David Runciman’s interesting Talking Politics podcast about the “alt-right”: “People who belonged loosely to this side of the political system were essentially excluded from public discourse. But it just so happened, they didn’t go quiet. They went to the net. So, for the best part of 20 years, a network of rightwing echo chambers has been established, upon which was built the infrastructure of Trump’s campaign.” Demonstrators on Washington’s Pennsylvania Avenue during the Women’s March in January. Photograph: Joshua Lott/AFP/Getty Images Two points come out of that. First, that we can see from the comparison that the net isn’t responsible for everything. Antisemites found ways to keep their ideas alive and generative without any such advantage, and with all the same forces of conservatism and common sense ranged against them. Second, as Runciman asks, what happened to the leftwing networks? Why don’t we have effective echo chambers? It is a question that all of us have been asking, one way or another; there is no shortage of radicalism on the left. Here, Arendt brings some liberating insight, described in precis by Professor Griselda Pollock, an expert in Arendt. “She talks of the creation of pan movements, these widespread ideas that overarch national, political and ethnic elements – the two big pan movements she talks about are bolshevism and nazism. There is a single explanation for everything, and before the single explanation, everything else falls away. She gives a portrait of how you produce these isolated people, who then become susceptible to pan ideologies, which give them a place in something. But the place they have is ultimately sacrificial; they don’t count for anything; all that counts is the big idea.” The left, in other words, isn’t necessarily unequal to the task of creating a pan-ideology; but anyone who believed in pluralism or complexity would have no currency on this terrain. We should be glad not to have been effective in this space, even if it feels like a failure. Arendt was born in Germany in 1906 and was an academic until 1933, when she embarked on charity work, securing passage to Palestine for Jewish children and teenagers. The decision was not based on any sudden realisation of Hitler’s menace. “For goodness sake,” she said, laughing, in a television interview in 1964, “we didn’t need [him] to know that the Nazis were our enemies. We also knew that a large number of Germans were behind him. That could not shock us in 1933.” Rather, she had been alienated from the intellectual milieu by their “coordinated” exclusion of their Jewish colleagues (Arendt came from a family of secular Jewish lefties). “The personal problem did not lie in what our enemies did but in what our friends did,” she said. “[They were] not yet under the pressure of terror, [but] it was as if a vacuum formed around one.” She conducted the refugee work from Paris. Stripped of her German citizenship in 1937, she escaped to New York in 1941 with her husband and mother, via the Gurs internment camp in the Vichy-held south of France. She was never unclear about the magnitude of the Holocaust, saying, in the same interview: “The decisive day was when we heard about Auschwitz. Before that, we said: ‘Well, one has enemies. That is natural. Why shouldn’t people have enemies?’ But this was different. It was as if an abyss had opened. Amends can be made for almost anything, at some point in politics, but not for this.” Arendt in New York in 1972. Photograph: New York Times Co/Getty Images However, she was a controversial figure by the 1960s, following the publication of Eichmann in Jerusalem, a consideration of Adolf Eichmann’s trial and what it revealed about the nature of the Final Solution and all those who were complicit in it. Opponents accused her of making the Jews complicit in their fate. She rejected that outright – “Nowhere in this book did I accuse the Jews of failing to resist” – but said, “that the tone is predominantly ironic is completely true. [Reading Eichmann’s trial] I laughed countless times, I laughed out loud. I’d probably still laugh three minutes before my certain death.” This is the book that coined the phrase “banality of evil”, which has ramifications for both totalitarianism as a project and the pathways of resistance. But it is also a useful thumbnail of the primacy of language to her understanding of politics; cliches in the service of control, their mundanity, their mendacity, cannot but amuse her. There is also the matter of Martin Heidegger, the philosopher with whom she had a turbulent relationship in the 20s, and some other contact – its extent unclear – after the war, despite his links with the Nazi party, even justifying them (it reads like the darkest imaginable romcom – “But I love him! But he’s a Nazi. But I love him!”). Pollock guards against drawing too many of the obvious parallels between The Origins of Totalitarianism and the US’s situation today: “Islamophobia is not elaborated with the same complexity of tropes and myths as antisemitism and one shouldn’t equate them.” The work of Arendt’s that she refers to most often is the one that came directly after Origins, 1958’s The Human Condition. In the Holocaust, “we have seen the abolition of the human,” Pollock explains, “and then she has to write what would actually be an account of the human as a political creature”. Arendt has two core beliefs about the human condition (not to be confused with human nature). First, Pollock explains: “Every human life is the potential beginning of something new. Unlike animals, which are predictable – each will behave as its parents behaved – something has begun in a human that could be completely different. This is ‘natality’. As a result of that, the human condition is plural.” The consequences of this are vast: as we communicate and use language, we show ourselves to one another in our difference, and it’s in this disclosure that action is generated: we can do something to change the world. Then comes a really important dichotomy, taking its roots from Greek philosophy: the difference between this action and labour, which is what we do to survive. Work is the economic, “which comes from the Greek word oikos, which is the household. But they imagined this other source, the political, the source of speech and action.” This is what constituted, for the Greeks, the human, and through Arendt’s prism, natality and plurality are the spurs of that political self; that is, the political recognises the infinite potential of each human life, while the economic recognises only that element of the human that works, that produces. As Pollock says: “What she was afraid of was the tendency to devalue action, for the economic to overtake the political.” Taken to its logical end, the economic overtaking the political results not in the extermination camp but in the concentration camp; the difference is crucial, Pollock explains. The concentration camp exists not to extinguish life but to extinguish the human. “You are removed from moral action, you become a number and, finally, you are reduced physiologically to a bundle of reactions, as the body struggles to survive extreme emaciation.” If politics is only a set of economic decisions, then the person is no more than the work they do and the infinite preciousness of every person’s potential cascades into a brutal homogeneity, one person indivisible from the next. To put this in a modern context, “official political reality is now being enacted by the modern capitalist businessman”. Politics and economics are, in Trump, indivisible. “And although it looks wonderful that people are demonstrating, it’s actually rather frightening, because it’s generating a crisis situation in which, ultimately, the protection of law and order justifies the government in extreme measures. For some of us, it’s repeating the proto-fascist scenario.” It’s an old Leninist stunt, the generation of civil unrest in order to attack civic society. In that sense, we are all playing into Trump’s tiny hands. Mark Davis, director of the Bauman Institute in Leeds, points us towards another text, On Violence (1970). “I think that gets us closer to what’s going on at the moment,” he says. “She said in that book that violence and power are actually opposites. When institutions, particularly those of government, start to break down and lose their legitimacy, they lose their power over the everyday conduct of citizens. So what they do as a response to the loss of power is incite violence. Violence floods in to the loss of power rather than being an expression of it.” A placard at the demonstration at Downing Street in January. Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images Pollock brings us back to demonstrations and what they do to language, the slogan being a flattening out of complexity, an echo of exactly the same one-idea pan-ideology of the oversimplified worldview they protest against. I’m not sure. You can pack quite a lot into a slogan – I particularly like: “First they came for the Muslims, and we said, not today, motherfucker.” Yet I see the sense of these arguments, and wonder, what would Hannah Arendt do? Would she have marched on Downing Street? Davis is conflicted. “Certainly, I think there is a lot to be gained from people gathering together to show solidarity. But in a world where the institutions that we’re protesting in front of are losing their legitimacy and their power, I’m not sure that this has the impact that it once did. If we think of evil as this one person, this one big event, then we tend to want to match that with one big display of resistance. But actually, if evil is banal – a set of ordinary, mundane decisions day by day – then maybe we have to start living differently day by day.” I still see the point in protesting as a concrete expression of solidarity. I’d take more, if under attack, from a person who went outside than a person who signed a petition. Tangentially, I have a sudden new faith in the feminist framing of recent demonstrations as women’s marches, which does something to allay the intimation of public violence that is always used as the justification of suppression. It seems clear, nonetheless, that it isn’t enough: that perhaps Arendt’s most profound legacy is in establishing that one has to consider oneself political as part of the human condition. What are your political acts, and what politics do they serve?",true/false
55,"The Public Prosecution Service (PPS) has today issued a decision to prosecute a former soldier, identified as Soldier B, for the offence of murder in relation to the death of a teenage boy in 1972, and for a charge of wounding with intent in respect of a second youth.    Fifteen-year-old Daniel Hegarty was shot and killed by a member of an Army patrol on duty in the Creggan area of Londonderry on 31 July 1972, during what was known as ‘Operation Motorman’.    Daniel died after being shot twice in the head by Soldier B. His cousin Christopher Hegarty, then aged 17, was also shot and injured in the incident.    The Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland, Stephen Herron, met with members of the Hegarty family to inform them of the decision at a private meeting in Derry today (Monday April 15, 2019).    Speaking afterwards, the Director said: “Following the ruling of the Divisional Court last year I conducted a review of this case.    “I have given careful consideration to all of the available evidence. This has included material obtained in the course of the initial investigation; by a later investigation carried out by the Historical Enquiries Team; material generated by Inquest proceedings and a number of expert forensic reports, the most recent of which was provided after the Court ruling in 2018.    “I have concluded that the evidence which can be presented at court is sufficient to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction and that the Evidential Test for Prosecution is met.    “As with all cases, I have also carefully considered whether the public interest requires prosecution through the courts. Particular consideration was given to Soldier B’s ill health, regarding which an updated medical report was obtained. In line with our Code for Prosecutors, I have concluded, given the seriousness of the charges, that the Public Interest Test for Prosecution is also met.    “I have therefore taken the decision to prosecute an individual identified as Soldier B for the offence of murder in relation to the death of Daniel Hegarty and for the wounding of Christopher Hegarty.    “This decision has been reached following an objective and impartial application of the Test for Prosecution which was conducted in accordance with the Code for Prosecutors and with the benefit of advice from Senior Counsel.”  Notes to Editors  Section 1 – reporting restrictions:    1. As a prosecution will shortly be commenced, the PPS does not intend to make any further comment on this case at this point.  2. The PPS would remind the media and the public that there should be no reporting, commentary or online sharing of information which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.  3. Soldier B’s anonymity should be maintained until the issue has been formally ruled upon by the court.  Section 2 – useful references:  4. All decisions by the PPS are taken strictly in accordance with the Test for Prosecution which involves two stages. The Test for Prosecution is met if, in relation to an identifiable suspect, the available evidence is sufficient to provide a reasonable prospect of a conviction (the Evidential Test) and if prosecution is in the public interest (the Public Interest Test). The Evidential Test must be passed first before the Public Interest Test is considered. Further information can be found in the PPS Code for Prosecutors. The PPS takes all of its decisions in accordance with the Code for Prosecutors, which can be found here.  5. What is a review? The PPS Code for Prosecutors allows for a review of a decision not to prosecute, for example, where new evidence or information becomes available or a specific request is made by a person, such as a Coroner or a victim.  A review involves the fresh application of the Test for Prosecution. If there is new or additional evidence this can be done by the Prosecutor who took the previous no prosecution decision. If there is no new or additional evidence a different Prosecutor who had no role in the original decision will conduct the review.  6. Decisions not to prosecute in this case were previously taken in 1973, in 2008 following a review of the case by the PSNI Historical Enquiries Team, and in 2016 following a referral by the Coroner. The 2016 decision not to prosecute was quashed by the Divisional Court in 2018 and a further review was conducted which resulted in the decisions to prosecute that have been announced today.    Section 3 – Legacy cases:  7. Cases where a prosecution decision has been taken.  We have identified 26 cases involving a large number of suspects which can be described as “legacy” in which the PPS has taken prosecutorial decisions since 2011.    Half of all such cases (13) relate to alleged offences involving republican paramilitaries and there have been prosecutions in eight of these. Proceedings are still active in three of these cases. Of the five concluded cases, there were two convictions and two in which proceedings were discontinued, one following the death of the defendant. There was also one acquittal.    Eight of the 26 cases related to alleged loyalist paramilitary activity. There were decisions to prosecute in four of these cases. Convictions have been secured in two cases while two others are currently active.    A further five cases involved a number of former soldiers (22). This has resulted in a decision to prosecute six individuals for a range of serious offences.    The final two cases involved police officers and both resulted in a decision not to prosecute.",true/false
56,"Updated at 3:00 p.m. ET on August 23, 2021  Robert Malone—a medical doctor and an infectious-disease researcher—recently suggested that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines might actually make COVID-19 infections worse. He chuckled as he imagined Anthony Fauci announcing that the vaccination campaign was all a big mistake (“Oh darn, I was wrong!”) and would need to be abandoned. When he floated that nightmare scenario during a recent podcast interview with Steve Bannon, both men seemed almost delighted at the prospect of public-health officials and pharmaceutical companies getting their comeuppance. “This is a catastrophe,” Bannon declared, beaming at his guest. “You’re hearing it from an individual who invented the mRNA [vaccine] and has dedicated his life to vaccines. He’s the opposite of an anti-vaxxer.”  Before going any further, let’s be clear that the back-and-forth between Bannon and Malone was premised on misinformation. The vaccines have repeatedly been shown to help prevent symptomatic coronavirus infections and reduce their severity. Malone was riffing on a botched sentence in a USA Today article, one that was later deleted but not before being screenshotted and widely shared. That kind of overheated, spottily sourced conversation is par for the course on shows like Bannon’s, which traffic in a set of claims that sound depressingly familiar: The vaccines cause more harm than experts are letting on; Fauci is a liar and possibly a fascist; and the mainstream news media is either shamelessly complicit or too stupid to figure out what’s really going on.  In that alternate media universe, Robert Malone’s star is ascendant. He started popping up on podcasts and cable news shows a few months ago, presented as a scientific expert, arguing that the approval process for the vaccines had been unwisely rushed. He told Tucker Carlson that the public doesn’t have enough information to decide whether to get vaccinated. He told Glenn Beck that offering incentives for taking vaccines is unethical. He told Del Bigtree, an anti-vaccine activist who opposes common childhood inoculations, that there hadn’t been sufficient research on how the vaccines might affect women’s reproductive systems. On show after show, Malone, who has quickly amassed more than 200,000 Twitter followers, casts doubt on the safety of the vaccines while decrying what he sees as attempts to censor dissent.  Read: How mRNA technology could change the world  Wherever he appears, Malone is billed as the inventor of mRNA vaccines. It’s in his Twitter bio. “I literally invented mRNA technology when I was 28,” says Malone, who is now 61. If that’s true—or, more to the point, if Malone believes it to be true—then you might expect him to be championing a very different message in his media appearances. According to one recent study, the innovation for which he claims to be responsible has already saved hundreds of thousands of lives in the United States alone; there’s talk that it may soon lead to a round of Nobel Prizes. It’s the kind of validation that few scientists in history have ever received. Yet instead of taking a victory lap, Malone has emerged as one of the most vocal critics of his own alleged accomplishment. He’s sowed doubt about the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines on pretty much any podcast or YouTube channel that will have him.  Why is the self-described inventor of the mRNA vaccines working so hard to undermine them?  Whether Malone really came up with mRNA vaccines is a question probably best left to Swedish prize committees, but you could make a case for his involvement. When I called Malone at his 50-acre horse farm in Virginia, he directed me to a 6,000-word essay written by his wife, Jill, that lays out why he believes himself to be the primary discoverer. “This is a story about academic and commercial avarice,” it begins. The document’s tone is pointed, and at times lapses into all-caps fury. She frames her husband as a genius scientist who is “largely unknown by the scientific establishment because of abuses by individuals to secure their own place in the history books.”  The abridged version is that when Malone was a graduate student in biology in the late 1980s at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, he injected genetic material—DNA and RNA—into the cells of mice in hopes of creating a new kind of vaccine. He was the first author on a 1989 paper demonstrating how RNA could be delivered into cells using lipids, which are basically tiny globules of fat, and a co-author on a 1990 Science paper showing that if you inject pure RNA or DNA into mouse muscle cells, it can lead to the transcription of new proteins. If the same approach worked for human cells, the latter paper said in its conclusion, this technology “may provide alternative approaches to vaccine development.”  These two studies do indeed represent seminal work in the field of gene transfer, according to Rein Verbeke, a postdoctoral fellow at Ghent University, in Belgium, and the lead author of a 2019 history of mRNA-vaccine development. (Indeed, Malone’s studies are the first two references in Verbeke’s paper, out of 224 in total.) Verbeke told me he believes that Malone and his co-authors “sparked for the first time the hope that mRNA could have potential as a new drug class,” though he also notes that “the achievement of the mRNA vaccines of today is the accomplishment of a lot of collaborative efforts.”  Read: The pandemic’s wrongest man  Malone says he deserves credit for more than just sparking hope. He dropped out of graduate school in 1988, just short of his Ph.D., and went to work at a pharmaceutical company called Vical. Now he claims that both the Salk Institute and Vical profited from his work and essentially prevented him from further pursuing his research. (A Salk Institute spokesperson said that nothing in the institute’s records substantiates Malone’s allegations. The biotech company into which Vical was merged, Brickell, did not respond to requests for comment.) To say that Malone remains bitter over this perceived mistreatment doesn’t do justice to his sense of aggrievement. He calls what happened to him “intellectual rape.”  One target of Malone’s ire, the biochemist Katalin Karikó, has been featured in multiple news stories as an mRNA-vaccine pioneer. CNN called her work “the basis of the Covid-19 vaccine” while a New York Times headline said she had “helped shield the world from the coronavirus.” None of those stories mentioned Malone. “I’ve been written out of the history,” he has said. “It’s all about Kati.” Karikó shared with me an email that Malone sent her in June, accusing her of feeding reporters bogus information and inflating her own accomplishments. “This is not going to end well,” Malone’s message says.  Karikó replied that she hadn’t told anyone that she is the inventor of mRNA vaccines and that “many many scientists” contributed to their success. “I have never claimed more than discovering a way to make RNA less inflammatory,” she wrote to him. She told me that Malone referred to himself in an email as her “mentor” and “coach,” though she says they’ve met in person only once, in 1997, when he invited her to give a talk. It’s Malone, according to Karikó, who has been overstating his accomplishments. There are “hundreds of scientists who contributed more to mRNA vaccines than he did.”  Malone insists that his warning to Karikó that “this is not going to end well” was not intended as a threat. Instead, he says, he was suggesting that her exaggerations would soon be exposed. Malone views Karikó as yet another scientist standing on his shoulders and collecting plaudits that should go to him. Others have been rewarded handsomely for their work on mRNA vaccines, he says. (Karikó is a senior vice president at BioNTech, which partnered with Pfizer to create the first COVID-19 vaccine to be authorized for use last year.) Malone is not exactly living on the streets: In addition to being a medical doctor, he has served as a vaccine consultant for pharmaceutical companies.  In any case, it’s clear enough that Malone isn’t singularly responsible for mRNA vaccines. The process of achieving major scientific advancements tends to be more cumulative and complex than the apple-to-the-head stories we usually tell, but this much can be said for sure: Malone was involved in groundbreaking work related to mRNA vaccines before it was cool or profitable; and he and others who believed in the potential of RNA-based vaccines in the 1980s turned out to be world-savingly correct.  Malone may keep company with vaccine skeptics, but he insists he is not one himself. His objections to the Pfizer and Moderna shots have to do mostly with their expedited approval process and with the government’s system for tracking adverse reactions. Speaking as a doctor, he would probably recommend their use only for those at highest risk from COVID-19. Everyone else should be wary, he told me, and those under 18 should be excluded entirely. (A June 23 statement from more than a dozen public-health organizations and agencies strongly encouraged all eligible people 12 and older to get vaccinated, because the benefits “far outweigh any harm.”) Malone is also frustrated that, as he sees it, complaints about side effects are being ignored or censored in the nationwide push to increase vaccination rates.  You might very well walk away with the skewed sense, after hearing Malone speak or reading his posts, that there is a far-reaching COVID-19 cover-up and that the real threat is the vaccine rather than the virus. I’ve listened to hours of Malone’s interviews and read through the many pages of documents he’s posted. He is a knowledgeable scientist with a knack for lucid explanation. It doesn’t hurt that he looks the part with his neatly trimmed white beard, or that he has a voice that would be well suited for a meditation app. Malone is not a subscriber to the more out-there conspiracy theories regarding COVID-19 vaccines—he doesn’t, for instance, think Bill Gates has snuck microchips into syringes—and he sometimes pushes back gently when hosts like Bigtree or Beck drift into more ludicrous territory.  And yet he does routinely slip into speculation that turns out to be misleading or, as in the segment on Bannon’s show, plainly false. For instance, he recently tweeted that, according to an unnamed “Israeli scientist,” Pfizer and the Israeli government have an agreement not to release information about adverse effects for 10 years, which is hard to believe given that the country’s health ministry has already warned of a link between the Pfizer shot and rare cases of myocarditis. Malone’s LinkedIn account has twice been suspended for supposedly spreading misinformation.  Read: The mRNA vaccines are extraordinary, but Novavax is even better  His concerns are personal, too. Malone contracted COVID-19 in February 2020, and later got the Moderna vaccine in hopes that it would alleviate his long-haul symptoms. Now he believes the injections made his symptoms worse: He still has a cough and is dealing with hypertension and reduced stamina, among other maladies. “My body will never be the same,” he told me. In media appearances, he often notes that he has colleagues in the government and at universities who agree with him and are privately cheering him on. I spoke with several of these people—vaccine scientists and biotech consultants, suggested by Malone himself— and that is not what they told me. The portrait they paint of Malone is of an insightful researcher who can be headstrong. They related accounts of him, pre-pandemic, getting booted from projects because he was hard to communicate with and unwilling to compromise. (Malone has acknowledged his penchant for butting heads with fellow scientists.) And they are taken aback by his emergence as a vaccine skeptic. One called his eagerness to appear on less-than-reputable podcasts “naive,” while another said he thought Malone’s public rhetoric had “migrated from extrapolated assertions to sensational assertions.” Stan Gromkowski, a cellular immunologist who did work on mRNA vaccines in the early 1990s and views Malone as an underappreciated pioneer, put it this way: “He’s fucking up his chances for a Nobel Prize.”  It’s only in the curious world of fringe media that Malone has found the platform, and the recognition, he’s sought for so long. He talks to hosts who aren’t going to question whether he’s the brains behind the Pfizer and Moderna shots. They’re not going to quibble over whether credit should be shared with co-authors, or talk about how science is like a relay race, or point out that, absent the hard work of brilliant researchers who came before and after Malone, there would be no vaccine. He’s an upgrade over their typical guest list of chiropractors and naturopaths, and they’re perfectly happy to address him by the title he believes he’s earned: inventor of the mRNA vaccines.  The irony is that, to the audiences who tune in to those shows, the vaccines are seen as a scourge rather than a godsend. No matter how nuanced Malone might try to be, or how many qualifiers he appends to his opinions, he is egging on vaccine hesitancy at a time when hospitals in the least-vaccinated parts of the country are struggling to cope with an influx of new COVID-19 patients. If you want proof of that, scroll through the many comments from his followers thanking him for confirming their fears. Malone has finally made his mark, by undermining confidence in the very vaccine he says wouldn’t be possible without his genius. It’s a victory, of sorts, but one that he and the rest of us may come to regret.",true/false
57,"In all of the times that we thought about a pandemic, in some hazy future that would probably never happen, the one thing that we mostly never foresaw was the truly epic amount of nonsense that would be produced. It seems like every second minute that a new myth about COVID-19 springs up that needs to be debunked, whether it’s the idea that drinking hot water can kill the virus (remember that from way back in April?) to the newer absurdity spreading around that most coronavirus deaths were actually caused by buses (spoiler: they weren’t). Pictured: At least 50% bigger than your average virus. Source: Pexels And so, when the newest misconception sprang up, instead of feeling elated that my purpose as a science communicator and blogger was being fulfilled, I instead felt the bone-crushing weariness that comes from total nonsense going very every single day of the year. And because this nonsense is about a pandemic disease, and policy makers do sometimes base their decisions on trash analyses published online, I felt like it’s important to address this inaccuracy as soon as possible. Which brings us here, to the claim: that 90% of all positive COVID-19 tests are false positives. This has serious implications, the story goes, because it means that there are actually virtually no cases of the disease in the country, and the government is lying to us all*. Which is, to be blunt, totally wrong. “I dropped a steaming pile of that idea on the paddock just this afternoon” Source: Pexels Let me explain. Testing For COVID-19 The main test used to determine if someone has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is called a polymerase chain reaction test or a PCR. PCR testing basically takes tiny amounts of viral DNA or RNA and amplifies it until you can detect it easily in a sample, and is one of the main ways we test for specific infections. PCR testing has a number of advantages, as well as some weaknesses. The test has a problem with identifying people who are in the early stages of infection. This is because it can be hard to get enough virus on a swab to replicate it in the test, which means that people who have only been infected 1 or 2 days ago may not be positive when they are tested. In fact, the sensitivity of the test can be as low as 40% in people who have only been infected a few days, meaning that 60% of tests are false negatives in this population. This is why many places will retest you if you are still having symptoms after a few days, even if your initial test was negative. Pictured: Somewhat less than ideal. Source: Pexels But in this blog, we’re not focusing on false negatives, we’re worried about false positives, because a few people having their COVID-19 missed is only worrisome if we care about public health rather than strange conspiracies. So, false positives. With the PCR tests used to detect COVID-19, the average number of false positives has been extremely well-calculated. We have been using these tests for decades, after all, and we’ve had the better part of a year to perfect them for this specific disease. While there were some early validations that showed slightly higher numbers of false positives, we’ve now got enormous samples run by researchers from across the world that show the rate of false positives in PCR tests for COVID-19 to be around 1 in 1,000 or lower. In other words, it is incredibly rare for a COVID-19 test that comes back positive to be a false positive. Almost unheard of. It happens, but very rarely, particularly because many tests are confirmed, i.e. run twice. Pictured: Very common these days. Source: Pexels Nonsense Numbers We can actually use two numbers, called specificity and sensitivity, to see the exact rate of tests that are ‘right’ in a population. The specificity of COVID-19 PCR tests is the ratio of true negatives to false positives+true negatives, which works out to about 99.9%. In other words, for every 1,000 people you test who truly don’t have the disease, you get 1 test that is falsely positive. Sensitivity is the ratio of true positives to false negatives+true positives, and while this is also high it’s not quite as high as specificity, averaging out around 98% or thereabouts. This means that for every 1,000 people you test who do have a coronavirus infection, you’ll miss about 20 true cases. Let’s imagine a population where about 50 in 1,000 people actually have COVID-19. You test all of them with PCR tests. Of the 950 people without the disease, you’ll get an average of one false positive test. Of the 50 people who do in fact have the disease, you’ll miss 1 person, which means 49 true positives. In this case, 98% of all positives are true positives, with just 1/49 tests being a false positive. You’ll also have missed one true positive, so your estimated prevalence — the proportion of people who you think have COVID-19 — is actually correct at 50/1,000. Pictured: According to stock photo websites, all science is test tubes or astronomy Source: Pexels Even with very low numbers of infections, the spectacularly high specificity of PCR tests means that you almost never have more false positives than true positives. If we repeat the calculation for a situation where only 50 in 10,000 people have COVID-19 in our sample, we still find 49 true positives and 10 false positives, which means our ‘correct’ percentage is now 83% — still very high, given the low population prevalence in the people we’re testing. In real life, it’s rare that so few of the people we test actually have the disease, because we target testing at those with symptoms and who think that they might be getting sick. And we can see this incredible accuracy happening in real life. In Australia, despite hundreds of thousands of tests conducted every week, there are vanishingly few positive results. In New South Wales, the state that I live in, we conduct more than 115,000 tests every week with <40 positive results. Even if every one of those were a false positive, the false positive rate would still be less than a fraction of 0.1%. More broadly, it is simply wrong to suggest that most tests coming back positive for COVID-19 are false positives. In reality, the simple truth is that most positive tests are just that: positive. The number of people who are sick with COVID-19 is increasing in many places in the world — particularly the UK — despite what certain inaccurate blogs might have you believe. This is the sad truth, and nothing more.",true/false
58,"Then Romney put his boys on notice: He would be making predetermined stops for gas, and that was it. Before beginning the drive, Mitt Romney put Seamus, the family's hulking Irish setter, in a dog carrier and attached it to the station wagon's roof rack. He'd built a windshield for the carrier, to make the ride more comfortable for the dog. His father had known poverty as a child, Mitt only privilege. His father had succeeded without a college degree while Mitt was launched with the finest educational pedigree. Given all his advantages, Mitt seemed restless to make his mark sooner. If anything, 36-year-old Mitt, who had just been tapped to lead a new venture capital firm, was on track to achieve more at a younger age than his famously overachieving father. Even for someone who had always idolized his father, the similarities between his path in life and the one George Romney had cut before him were remarkable. Husband to his high school sweetheart , father to a brood of young children , bishop of his local Mormon church, and businessman on the threshold of life-altering success. As with most ventures in his life, he had left little to chance, mapping out the route and planning each stop. The destination for this journey in the summer of 1983 was his parents' cottage on the Canadian shores of Lake Huron. Romney would be returning to the place of his most cherished childhood memories. The white Chevy station wagon with the wood paneling was overstuffed with suitcases, supplies, and sons when Mitt Romney climbed behind the wheel to begin the annual 12-hour family trek from Boston to Ontario. Ann's roommate at BYU was Cindy Burton, a Michigan friend who would go on to marry Ann's older brother. Now Cindy Davies, she says that for a time she thought Ann might end up marrying Cameron. So it was in the fall of 1968, just months after he had survived a horrific car crash, that Romney received the letter he had been dreading. It wasn't the classic breakup letter, but it was close. Ann wrote that she hadn't had feelings for any of the BYU men pursuing her, until this one fellow named Kim Cameron, a basketball player and vice president of the student government. He reminded her, she wrote, of Mitt. Ann, meanwhile, was living the life of a co-ed at Brigham Young University. The Provo, Utah, campus was flush with men who had just returned from their own missions, with sharpened skills of persuasion and a determination to find a wife made more urgent by the Mormon ban on premarital sex. Not for nothing was the place nicknamed B-Y-Woo. But the 2 1/2-year mission took its toll on the romance. Under the rigid rules for missionaries, Romney was forbidden from telephoning Ann more than a couple of times a year, and his two visits with her were brief and supervised. Ann Davies had said yes to his informal marriage proposal when she was just 16. After Romney went to France, his father personally baptized her a Mormon. Staring at the wall, Romney worried, ''Is this what's in store for me?'' Back in 1967, when Romney was moving into a Paris apartment with fellow Mormon missionaries at 126 Rue du Chateau, his eyes were immediately drawn to a wall covered with hand-written letters. They were all ''Dear John'' break-up notes that other missionaries had received from their girlfriends back home. He had always treated Ann that way, especially since he'd nearly lost her. Tagg didn't get it back then, but now at age 37 he finally understands why his father has been willing to suspend his regimented ways when it comes to his wife. ''When they were dating,'' Tagg says, ''he felt like she was way better than him, and he was really lucky to have this catch. He really genuinely still feels that way, thinks, 'I'm so lucky I've got her.' So he puts her on a pedestal.'' ''Think about it,'' Tagg says, ''a 12-hour drive and the only time we stop is to get gas. When we stop, you can buy your food and go to the bathroom, but that's the only time we're stopping, so you'd better get it all done at once.'' Yet there was one exception to Mitt's nonstop policy. ''As soon as my mom says, 'I think I need to go to the bathroom,' he pulls over instantly, and doesn't complain. 'Anything for you, Ann.'.'' The church was at the center of the family's spiritual and social lives. Before high school every day, the boys went to a neighbor's house for ''seminary,'' where they would discuss scripture for 45 minutes. Sunday mornings were spent in church, and Sunday afternoons were devoted to volunteer work. Tuesday evening ''mutual'' brought together church families for basketball games and cookouts. While moving ahead briskly in the business world, Mitt took on the added responsibility of serving as a lay bishop of Belmont's Mormon congregation. ''Mitt,'' says Kem Gardner, a fellow church official from this period, ''just had the capacity to keep all the balls up in the air.'' Mitt and Ann moved east in 1971 so he could attend graduate school at Harvard. They settled in Belmont and began expanding their family. In 1981, Ann delivered their fifth and final son. By then, they had moved from a modest three-bedroom place to a handsome four-bedroom, natural shingle house near the private Belmont Hill School, which all five boys would attend. The next morning, the wedding party and guests flew to Salt Lake City and in the spired Mormon temple, Mitt and Ann were ''sealed'' for eternity. Because they were not Mormons, Ann's parents were not allowed inside. Mitt and Ann agreed to wait three months to walk down the aisle. The wedding was held in two parts. On March 21, 1969, exactly four years after their first conversation, Mitt, then 22, and Ann, 19, exchanged rings in a civil ceremony in her parents' home. It was officiated by church Elder Edwin Jones, the man after whom teenage Mitt had patterned his hairstyle. When they made it home, he told his parents about their plans for an immediate wedding. His father was delighted. His mother was horrified. A pillar of Detroit society, Lenore Romney knew a wedding was not something to be rushed. But that was only part of her hesitation. ''I think Lenore had a hard time letting go of her youngest son,'' Cindy Davies says, stressing Lenore's special connection to the baby her doctors had said she could never have. While George had quickly forged a loving bond with Ann, it took longer for Lenore. ''Her relationship with Ann wasn't as warm. She held back more.'' ''You want to get married?'' he asked. ''I feel exactly the same way,'' she said. ''Gosh, this feels like I've never been gone,'' he recalls telling her. ''I can't believe it.'' Ann joined the Romney clan in meeting him at the airport. Showered with hugs from his family, Mitt kept his focus squarely on Ann. Sitting with her in the third-row seat of his sister's Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser, he wasted little time. As he flew home just before Christmas 1968, Romney worried about what awaited him and Ann. ''I didn't know how we would feel.'' Romney feared the same. In letters to Ann, he implored her to wait for him. ''I think that's probably right,'' Cameron says now. ''Emotionally, I felt very close to her.'' A few years later, Ann would be mocked for her public claim that she and Mitt had never had an argument, which sounded preposterous to the ears of many married mortals. But Tagg says it's not that his parents never disagree. ''I know there are things that she says that he doesn't agree with sometimes, and I see him kind of bite his tongue. But I know that they go and discuss it in private. He doesn't ever contradict my mother in public.'' After a few years, the tensions lifted, as Mitt learned to give Tagg more space, and Tagg began to regret how he'd been behaving. By the time he was 15, the arguments stopped, and Tagg was once again looking at his father and seeing his hero. Tagg's early-adolescent struggles were emotional in nature, which meant they played more to his mother's strengths than his father's. With a few exceptions, ''he's not emotional at all,'' Tagg says. ''She runs on emotion, he runs on logic.'' Tagg had no problem with his mother, ''but my dad and I would just go at it.'' Family members say Mitt had a tough time dealing with this rejection from his oldest son. After all, Mitt's relationship with his own father had never suffered such strain. ''Overnight,'' Tagg says, ''everything about him bugged me.'' The way he wore his jeans so short. The way he insisted all the boys wake up early on Saturdays for chores. Even the way he said good morning. ''It bothered me that he would be so nice about it.'' As Mitt had before him, Tagg spent his early years idolizing his father. But then he spent much of his adolescence wanting nothing to do with his dad. It began around age 11, when his father in his eyes went from ''superman to supernerd.'' In time, the five boys would take on their own profiles within the family. As Tagg would later describe his brothers, Matt was ''the jokester, always pushing people's buttons'' and Josh was ''the typical middle child, wanting lots of attention and getting a lot of it.'' Ben remained ''very reserved and quiet, a little aloof from the situation'' while Craig relished his role as ''the ultimate baby, everyone's favorite brother.'' Tagg says he himself was the typical oldest brother, ''Type A and too tightly wound.'' At night, the family had a tradition of holding a freewheeling discussion while sitting together in a room, with the lights turned off. The practice was an outgrowth of the boys' habit of wandering into their parents' room in the middle of the night, climbing onto the couch at the foot of their bed, and wanting to talk. Over time, the discussion drifted to the evening hours before bed, with the darkened room somehow allowing the boys to feel more free to open up. ''It was just a time to totally be yourself,'' Tagg says. Later that summer, Ann and Mitt, according to the story they both would tell, were lying in bed when she turned to him. With her father's advice about making the most of life still echoing in her head, she told Mitt, ''You've got to run against Ted Kennedy.'' He laughed and pulled the covers over his head. In June 1993, as her condition worsened, Ann's mother asked her sons, Rod and Jim Davies, to baptize her a Mormon, according to both sons. Five days after her baptism, she died. In late summer 1992, Ann's father's condition quickly deteriorated. He remained opposed to organized religion, even though all three of his children, thanks largely to their association with Mitt Romney, had built their lives around the Mormon Church. As he bid his life goodbye, he urged his only daughter to make the most of hers. Not long after settling into their new house, Ann and Mitt invited her parents to move in to their guest suite above a bank of garages. Ann's father was battling prostate cancer, her mother ovarian cancer, and Ann nursed them through their treatments at Massachusetts General Hospital. In 1990, Romney began a turnaround effort at Bain & Company, the much larger -- but fast sinking -- sister company to Bain Capital. A few years later, he was back full time at his old firm. It had been reorganized as Bain Capital Inc., with Romney as CEO and sole owner. And it had matured, meaning far bigger paychecks were on their way. Before long, his father could have afforded to buy up the whole street, as he built a fortune that two of his former partners now estimate to be more than $400 million. Then, in 1989, Mitt and Ann allowed their first bout of conspicuous spending, plunking down $1.25 million for a stately five-bedroom house up the road, enlarging and renovating it, plus installing a pool and tennis court. At the time, Tagg was in France, following in his father's footsteps as a Mormon missionary. After his parents sent him a photo of their new place, he asked his father, ''How can you afford that house?'' His sons urged him to buy a luxury car, but he refused. Still, they had no idea how much money he had. Yet Mitt eschewed the trappings of wealth. The family had no cook or full-time maid. And Mitt continued to drive a dented Chevy Caprice Classic nicknamed ''the gray grunt.'' As the 1980s wore on, Mitt's responsibilities grew both at work and in the church, where he was promoted to stake president, overseeing about a dozen congregations. And his Midas touch at Bain Capital was helping to make him rich. In that way, the relationship between Mitt and Ann differed from the one between Mitt's parents. Despite their lifetime of devotion, George and Lenore had no problem airing their disagreements, especially in later years, according to Tagg. ''Listen, they fought like cats and dogs. We called them 'The Bickersons.'.'' It was the year Newt Gingrich was pushing his Contract with America, but Romney distanced himself from Gingrich and rejected help from the national right-wing apparatus. Romney stressed his own family values to create a contrast with Kennedy, who had a past reputation for womanizing. One commercial showed Mitt and Ann on their porch with glasses of lemonade. Asked to name his greatest personal failing, Romney lamented that he only had time to help the needy one day a week. He supported the assault weapons ban and the Brady gun control law. He favored indexing the minimum wage to inflation. In a letter to an organization of gay Republicans, he claimed he would be a stronger advocate for their rights than Kennedy. He demanded work for welfare recipients and talked tough on immigration, mandatory drug sentencing, and the death penalty. And, running in a state where the GOP's limited success had come mostly from fiscally conservative, socially liberal candidates, Romney staked out moderate positions on some issues. Despite Kennedy's baggage, Romney's team ruled out a character assault. Instead, Romney attacked Kennedy and his ''big-government'' policies as both being overdue for retirement. In October 1993, Romney changed his party affiliation from independent to Republican and began raising money. In February 1994, before a crowd of about 200 at the Copley Plaza, he formally announced his candidacy. Political operatives told Romney that Kennedy was never more vulnerable. ''People said to me, 'You know, he's getting older, he's over the hill. He's not coherent any more,'.'' Romney recalls. ''I was getting ready for this guy that was going to be kind of a doddering old fool. I'd be able to crush him like a grape.'' But Romney had timing on his side. An anti-Democratic storm was building nationwide. And the youngest Kennedy brother was a tarnished icon, even to Catholic voters raised in homes with brittle palm fronds wedged behind pictures of John F. Kennedy. The shocking revelations about the senior senator that emerged during the 1991 Palm Beach rape trial of his nephew remained fresh in many voters' minds. For a man who had succeeded in business largely by using rigorous analysis and fastidious preparation to reduce his margin of error, a run against Kennedy would be quite a roll of the dice. In 32 years, no Republican had come close to dislodging Kennedy, the embodiment of Democratic liberalism. Mitt had been contemplating a move into politics for some time. At age 55, his father had used his success as a business turnaround artist to launch his second act of politics. Now Mitt, who had already established his own turnaround credentials, was looking to follow the same script, except a decade ahead of his father's schedule. Romney held a news conference to criticize Kennedy for violating his own brother's edict to separate religion and politics, which in 1960 helped John Kennedy become the nation's first Catholic president. Kennedy's campaign said Romney should be asked about the Mormon Church's past policy of excluding blacks from the priesthood. But the Kennedy machinery, rusty at the start, was cranking up. So was the senator. Mitt's own race in 1994 got off to a good start. After he easily won the Republican primary , polls showed Romney to be even with or even slightly ahead of Kennedy. In the end, Hart handed out more than flowers, drubbing Lenore and giving her sons two important lessons about politics, according to Scott. ''You need to define yourself, and not let others define you. And it's no fun to lose.'' They resented how Hart tried to paint Lenore as a nice woman whose place was in the home, not the Senate. ''At the start of every debate, he would come over and hand her a rose,'' Scott recalls. Lenore Romney ran for US Senate in 1970 against popular Democratic incumbent Philip Hart. Taking a break from college to help out, 23-year-old Mitt turned to his older brother, Scott, and said, ''Gee, you and I ought to be running this campaign.'' Mitt had always been more careful and wary than his father, according to family members, and, in that way, more like his mother. In fact, his race against Kennedy had stronger parallels to his mother's single run for office than any of his father's campaigns. Despite the similarities between father and son in appearance and career path, the race highlighted the differences in their makeup. Behind the scenes, George - whose unguarded nature had hastened his downfall in the 1968 presidential campaign - admonished Mitt to loosen up, stop listening to consultants, and trust his gut. On the trail and on the fund-raising circuit, the vigorous 86-year-old was a celebrity stand-in for his son, relishing his return to the podium. Years later, Mitt Romney would recall watching the cameras shift away from him and onto his irrepressible father during press conferences, as George shook his fist and spoke his mind. Before long, George and Lenore moved into the guest suite above Mitt and Ann's garage, and George wasted no time in tutoring his son in politics. During the campaign kickoff, George Romney introduced his son, signaling the active role the former Michigan governor would play in the race and the reemergence of the father-son dynamic that had defined Mitt Romney's early life. He was more welcoming of help from his family. ''I don't want their money. I don't want their help,'' Romney said. ''This is my race.'' Still, Romney remained within striking distance, down 44 percent to Kennedy's 49 percent in a Globe poll in early October. Then came the first televised debate . Romney was on leave as Bain Capital's chief executive when the cuts occurred, but he struggled to rebut the charge. His polls numbers began to drop, with more voters describing him as a cold-hearted businessman. About a month before the election, Kennedy launched his most devastating attack. On the airwaves, he strafed Romney with tough ads designed to turn his greatest asset of business success into a vulnerability. Romney's Bain Capital had bought a paper company called American Pad & Paper, or Ampad , which then bought an Indiana plant and laid off workers, cut wages, and reduced benefits. The workers began striking. Seizing on Romney's candidacy, they brought their complaints to Massachusetts. Romney accepted the endorsement of Massachusetts Citizens for Life, though his aides labored to blur the distinctions with Kennedy, who years earlier had dropped his opposition to abortion and become a leader on abortion rights. Asked at the time how the two candidates differed on abortion, Romney's political consultant Charles Manning said, ''It's tiny nuances.'' Women's groups and political foes voiced skepticism over Romney's support of abortion rights. Although he said that as a politician he would not force his beliefs on others, Romney acknowledged that as a church leader, he had counseled women against having abortions. The Globe reported that as a Mormon bishop Romney had urged a mother of five, whose pelvic blood clot made her pregnancy dangerous, not to have an abortion. But there had been some wavering. Early in the campaign, he said he opposed Medicaid funding for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest, or threat to the mother's life. Later in the campaign, he said he would leave that matter up to the states. ''My mother and my family have been committed to the belief that we can believe as we want, but we will not force our beliefs on others on that matter,'' Romney declared. ''And you will not see me wavering on that.'' Although he always said he was personally opposed to abortion, Romney sought to reassure Massachusetts voters of his pro-choice bona fides by citing his mother's example. Lenore had run for the Senate on an abortion-rights platform, a stance forged by the death of her son-in-law's teenage sister from an illegal abortion. The Kennedy camp also hammered Romney on abortion, asserting that he had a secret pro-life agenda. But it was George Romney who stole the show that day. Surprising even his son, he stepped forward and thundered, ''I think it is absolutely wrong to keep hammering on the religious issues. And what Ted is trying to do is bring it into the picture.'' In 1997, Ann Romney felt numbness in her right leg. Then it spread to her entire right side. She had trouble getting up the stairs. Over the next year, she began having some difficulty swallowing, needing more sleep than usual, and feeling nauseated for a good part of every day. After the loss, Mitt told his brother, ''I never want to run for something again unless I can win.'' An unfailing optimist, George had never wallowed in his own failed campaign, and he didn't dwell on his son's either. Still, for Mitt, there was no denying that his idol's last image of him was one associated with failure. With Mitt back at Bain, his parents returned to Michigan. A year later, George Romney collapsed while running on his treadmill. He died at age 88. ''I'm sure I ruffled a lot of feathers,'' Romney recalled in his autobiography ''Turnaround.'' ''I had been gone for a year, and they were getting along fine without me. But Bain Capital was my baby and I was back in town. I owned 100 percent of the voting stock.'' After a year spent surrendering control to others - consultants, voters, even his father - Romney wasted no time in returning to his more comfortable position of being in charge. The morning after the election, he held a meeting at Bain Capital, and immediately started handing out assignments and reviewing deals. On election day, as Gingrich helped the GOP capture both houses of Congress for the first time in nearly half a century, Kennedy crushed Romney , 58 percent to 41 percent. By the end of the campaign, Romney began to heed his father's advice and loosen up. But it wasn't enough. Mitt Romney, like his mother a quarter-century earlier, had allowed his opponent to define him. When Romney charged that Kennedy had benefited from a no-bid real estate deal, the senior senator thundered back with the full weight of his family's history behind him. ''Mr. Romney, the Kennedys are not in public service to make money,'' he said, delivering a rehearsed line to wild applause. ''We have paid too high a price in our commitment to the public service of this country.'' Kennedy laid into Romney on Ampad . ''I don't know why you wouldn't meet with the strikers with that flimflam deal of yours out there in Indiana,'' he snorted. Expectations were low for Kennedy, seen as past his prime, and high for Romney, the telegenic upstart. But with his booming voice and fiery tone, Kennedy came out swinging. Although Romney had some effective parries and Kennedy occasionally tripped on his words, Romney appeared overmatched on stage with a legend. Fit and not yet 50, Ann knew something was seriously wrong. At first, Mitt held out hope that the numbness might be from a pinched nerve. In 1998, when Ann's primary care doctor referred her to a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, Mitt went along. It was there, sitting in the neurologist's waiting room, when Mitt grasped the severity of what his wife was up against. One of the brochures he spotted was about Lou Gehrig's disease, another about multiple sclerosis. There was no brochure for pinched nerves. Mitt turned to his wife and, seeing the worry in her eyes, said, ''I can deal with anything, so long as it's not fatal.'' Once in the exam room, Dr. John Stakes led Ann through a series of neurological tests - pinpricks, standing on one leg, turning around with her eyes closed. It quickly became clear she was not doing well. ''When she'd stand, for instance, with her eyes closed,'' Mitt recalled recently, ''she'd fall over.'' After the doctor left the room, Mitt recalled, Ann ''broke down and cried, and I shed tears with her.'' The confirmation of the diagnosis as multiple sclerosis would come later, after an MRI. But it was this crushing experience of watching Ann fail test after test that Mitt would describe later as the worst day of his life. Until this moment, his had been mostly a charmed life. He had suffered defeat as a candidate, but that could be dismissed as the folly of taking on an icon. Mitt's siblings, meanwhile, had all suffered setbacks, including painful divorces endured by his brother and older sister. ''My life did not remain golden. I hit bottom,'' his sister Jane says. ''But it continued for Mitt.'' Yet, seeing the love of his life have to face a potentially crippling disease changed Mitt Romney. ''It subdued him,'' Jane says. The first two years after Ann's diagnosis were particularly trying, Mitt says. ''She'd get a little better and then she'd get worse.'' Meanwhile, his mother's health was also deteriorating, and in the summer of 1998, she suffered a stroke and died. Eventually, Ann found remarkable relief through a surprising mix of treatments - mainstream, alternative, and equestrian. To supplement her traditional care, Ann found a retired 80-year-old guru of reflexology by the name of Fritz Blietschau who agreed to take her on as a patient, helping her to build muscle strength. Ann also rekindled her childhood passion of horseback riding, finding that the exercise improved her mobility and spirits. She was beginning to see how MS didn't necessarily have to mean a future in a wheelchair. The lesson was coming not in Belmont, where she had made her home for nearly 30 years, but rather in Utah, where her reflexologist and equestrian companions were both based. By early 1999, Ann and Mitt were based there as well. That's because when the call came through offering Mitt Romney the opportunity of a lifetime, it also came with a Utah address.

59,"Spring Is Springing Sooner, Throwing Nature's Rhythms Out Of Whack  Enlarge this image toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR Nathan Rott/NPR  There's a cycle that starts when the snow melts and the earth thaws high in Colorado's Rocky Mountains. It's a seasonal cycle based on timing and temperature, two variables that climate change is pushing increasingly out of sync.  To the outsider, it can be hard to see: Plants still grow, flowers bud, bears awake, and marmots breed. Broad-tailed hummingbirds still trill around a landscape that evokes the opening scene of The Sound of Music, with flowery meadows and granite peaks.  But those who know this ecosystem will tell you something is a little off. The flowers are blooming earlier. The marmots are mating in early May. Spring is springing sooner across the Northern Hemisphere, changing natural cycles around the world.  In Alaska, brown bears are changing their feeding habits to eat elderberries that ripen earlier.  In California, birds are nesting and breeding a week earlier than they did a century ago.  ""One of the consequences of climate change is that even though everything is happening earlier, they're not changing at the same rate,"" says David Inouye, an ecologist from the University of Maryland who has spent more than 40 years documenting the change in Colorado's alpine meadows.  toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR  The results can be seen all around him. Flowers are blooming before there are bees to pollinate them. Hard frosts are still occurring long after winter's snow melts away, decimating fruit orchards and budding plants. Allergy season is getting longer.  Inouye says that when he started spending his summers at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Gothic, Colo., cataloging flowers in the thin mountain air, climate change wasn't really a thing people were talking about. But as time went on, the evidence of it started to become unavoidable.  ""Temperatures are getting warmer here,"" he says. ""The April low temperatures here are now about 6 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than they used to be.""  Some plants and wildlife, taking their thermal cue, have been able to adapt in kind. Some are thriving. Others are being left behind.  toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR  Fewer flowers, fewer worker bees  Colorado's snowpack this year was the worst it had been in more than 30 years. Temperatures in early spring soared.  Many researchers here view this as a glimpse of things to come.  ""You can see it visually,"" says Rebecca Irwin, an ecologist from North Carolina State University. ""We have less flowers.""  Fewer flowers means less food for the native bees that buzz around in meadows like the one Irwin stands in.  She and two others are equipped with wispy butterfly nets and fanny packs filled with plastic vials.  They're hoping to get an idea of how different bees are doing in this environment by catching as many of them as they can over the course of an hour. It is a task that proves easy.  toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR  With lunges and hops, they catch sweat bees and leafcutter bees, queens and workers.  At the end of the time period, it's clear that they caught far fewer worker bees than they would have in a normal year.  ""It's hard to know if they're just delayed or if they're not doing well because there's no food for them,"" Irwin says.  Some bees, Irwin says, seem to be doing fine. In years like this, they're able to emerge earlier to meet the early bloom.  ""But some of them are constrained by how long it takes them to develop,"" she says.  The fear is that those bees and the flowers that depend on them for pollination could slowly get pushed out.  Michael Stemkovski of North Carolina State says documenting these changes can be disheartening. ""It's kind of like watching an illness progress without having the tools to remedy it.""  toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR  We may not like the climate change winners  The ability of a species to adapt to its circumstances — to roll with the environmental punches, so to speak — is called plasticity.  Species that have a lot of plasticity tend to be generalists. They're able to make the situation work. Species with less plasticity, those that depend on a specific ecosystem or climate, are more likely to struggle.  ""When you think of a plant that can't move over its lifetime, it either tolerates a dry area or it doesn't,"" says Dan Blumstein, a conservation biologist from the University of California, Los Angeles. He specializes in marmots, a large ground squirrel that is, in Blumstein's words, ""remarkably plastic.""  ""Marmots are all about getting obese,"" Blumstein says. ""They adjust their annual schedule appropriately to be active when the vegetation is growing.""  toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR  An earlier spring means a longer growing season, so they have more time to gather food. As a result, Blumstein says, marmots seem to be getting bigger. He stops short of calling them a ""climate change winner"" though, noting that a longer growing season also means more chances for them to be killed by predators.  Other species are emerging as winners though, including ""some that people might not be very fond of,"" says Jill Anderson, a geneticist at the University of Georgia.  She points to poison ivy, which is expected to thrive with more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  Researchers at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory also report seeing far more ticks this summer than in any previous year. That report is consistent with studies showing that the range for ticks is increasing with a warming climate.  And there is a lot of evidence that climate change is diminishing biodiversity, which can be seen in these alpine meadows as well.  toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR  A glimpse of the future  Just off a ridge, in a verdant meadow, John Harte, an ecologist from the University of California, Berkeley, has created a window into the future of this place. It's a grim one.  ""When I tell people what to expect, I say, 'Well, imagine the opening scene of The Sound of Music was filmed outside of Reno, Nevada,' "" he says. ""Because that's what it's going to be.""  Twenty eight years ago, Harte suspended a series of heat lamps in long, humming rows, a few feet off the ground. The lamps, which were designed for chicken farmers in Pennsylvania, raise the temperature on the ground by about 4 to 5 degrees.  toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR  ""That's comparable to the climate we expect by the year 2050,"" he says.  The heat lamps have been on since then, day and night, and the change that is occurring beneath them is remarkable.  The yellow and purple flowers that dot the landscape nearby are mostly gone. In their place is sagebrush, a prolific plant that you would usually see at lower elevations.  ""We are projecting that all of these meadows are going to look like that,"" Harte says, pointing to the gnarled plant. ""We are homogenizing the planet.""  There's another concern, just as great. Harte and his colleagues have found that the heated soil holds far less carbon than the native ground. That missing carbon, he says, is going into the air, creating the potential for a feedback process that will accelerate climate change further.  ""Ecosystems affect climate just as much as climate affects ecosystems,"" he says. ""And the changes happen quick.""",true/false
60,"The threats of ERCOT power blackouts are emerging again this spring, just two months after millions of Texans survived freezing temperatures without heat or power during extended blackouts in February 2021.  On Tuesday, April 13, Texas’ power grid again faced failure as extended maintenance work and unseasonable weather patterns brought typical supply levels lower. ERCOT called for power conservation, and averted crisis by the evening, rescinding the request.  By Wednesday, April 14, Texas was again at risk for blackouts due to power supply issues. ERCOT declared it would be “capacity insufficient” from 1-8 p.m CDT. This means ERCOT does not have enough reserves and will ask people in Texas to conserve power again.  This is being caused by a weather pattern that is unusually warm for this time of year in South Texas. The results: strong demand and on-peak wind generation that is 6.5 gigawatts, compared with average April wind generation of 11 gigawatts. Solar generation was also lower. It hit only 38% during peak load on April 14, while the average is 72%.  The weather isn’t totally to blame for the power supply issues, of course. The large number of units that are offline for maintenance following the winter storm is also driving this shortage. The reported telemetered outages on April 14 is 21.1 gigawatts, where normally ERCOT would be measuring around 14.5 gigawatts of outages in ERCOT for the third week of April.

61,"We are outspoken about our optimism. These days, though, optimism seems to be in short supply. The headlines are filled with awful news. Every day brings a different story of political division, violence, or natural disaster. Despite the headlines, we see a world that’s getting better. Compare today to the way things were a decade or a century ago. The world is healthier and safer than ever. The number of children who die every year has been cut in half since 1990 and keeps going down. The number of mothers who die has also dropped dramatically. So has extreme poverty—declining by nearly half in just 20 years. More children are attending school. The list goes on and on. But being an optimist isn’t about knowing that life used to be worse. It’s about knowing how life can get better. And that’s what really fuels our optimism. Although we see a lot of disease and poverty in our work—and many other big problems that need to be solved—we also see the best of humanity. We spend our time learning from scientists who are inventing cutting-edge tools to cure disease. We talk to dedicated government leaders who are being creative about prioritizing the health and well-being of people around the world. And we meet brave and brilliant individuals all over the world who are imagining new ways to transform their communities. That’s our response when people ask, “How can you be so optimistic?” It’s a question we’ve been getting more and more, and we think the answer says a lot about how we view the world. This is our 10th Annual Letter, and we’re marking the occasion by answering 10 tough questions that people ask us. We will answer them as forthrightly as we can, and we hope that when you’re finished reading, you’ll be just as optimistic as we are.  TGN_CH_BO_BGChapterMenuHolder  | 1  Languages PDF Download  1. Why don’t you give more in the United States? Melinda: Our foundation spends about $500 million a year in the United States, most of it on education. That’s a lot, but it is less than the roughly $4 billion we spend to help developing countries. We don’t compare different people’s suffering. All suffering is a terrible tragedy. We do, however, assess our ability to help prevent different kinds of suffering. When we studied the global health landscape, we realized that our resources could have a disproportionate impact. We knew we could help save literally millions of lives. So that’s what we’ve tried to do. Take vaccines. We assumed that since it was possible to prevent disease for a few cents or a few dollars at most, it was being taken care of. But it turned out that we were wrong, and tens of millions of kids weren’t being immunized at all. We’ve spent $15.3 billion on vaccines over the past 18 years. And it’s been a terrific investment. Better immunization is one reason why the number of children who die has gone down by so much, from almost 10 million in 2000 to 5 million last year. That’s 5 million families that didn’t have to suffer the trauma of losing a daughter or a son, a sister or a brother. We love our country and care deeply about the people who live here, so we are also committed to fighting inequities in the United States. All the evidence, including our personal experience, suggests that education is the key to opportunity. By 2020, two-thirds of American jobs will require post-high school education or training. Since millions of American students don’t get a high-quality education, that’s the issue we’ve been focused on for the past 18 years. Our goal is for all students to go to a school that prepares them to pursue their dreams. Bill: We’ve been looking at how we might expand our work in the U.S. beyond education. We fund the U.S. Partnership on Mobility from Poverty, which is studying ways to help people move up the economic ladder. Although we travel extensively to learn about the lives of poor people in other countries, we’ve done less of that in America. So last fall, we took a trip to the South to learn more. Our trip to Atlanta in October 2017. In Atlanta, we met a single mom who told us a heartbreaking story about how she had just been evicted from her apartment for missing a rent payment while in the hospital with her newborn son. We had coffee with a few residents of an apartment complex in one of the city’s low-income neighborhoods. They showed us mold growing on the walls and ceiling of one of their homes. They told us they routinely hide their children under a bed or in the bathtub because of the sound of gunfire. It would be an understatement to say the people we met in Atlanta faced big challenges. But they were also incredibly resilient. At a Boys and Girls Club, we met a man who uses his own money to buy lunch for the kids. We talked with former prison inmates who are now holding down jobs and raising families. What we saw on this trip reinforced the importance of education, because it is ultimately about helping low-income students and students of color get the same opportunities as everyone else. The visit also made us think through other ways we could help people get out of poverty. The issues of economic mobility in America are deeply intertwined: education, employment, race, housing, mental health, incarceration, substance abuse. We haven’t decided how what we’ve been learning might affect our giving, but it has certainly had an effect on us. We will share more about our approach when we have settled on a strategy.  2. What do you have to show for the billions you’ve spent on U.S. education? Bill: A lot, but not as much as either of us would like. We made education the focus of our work in the United States because it is the key to a prosperous future, for individuals and the country. Unfortunately, although there’s been some progress over the past decade, America’s public schools are still falling short on important metrics, especially college completion. And the statistics are even worse for disadvantaged students. We support early learning and postsecondary institutions, but we started with high schools, and that’s still the area in which we invest the most. We’ve learned a lot about what works in education, but the challenge has been to replicate the successes widely. In the early 2000s, our foundation was one of the organizations that drew attention to a big flaw in the way high-school graduation rates were calculated. They were often reported at 90 percent when they were actually less than 70 percent—that is, roughly a third of students were dropping out. We funded research that identified the true graduation rate and helped build a coalition of states that agreed to use it. To help raise those graduation rates, we supported hundreds of new secondary schools. Many of them have better achievement and graduation rates than the ones they replaced or complemented. Early on, we also supported efforts to transform low-performing schools into better ones. This is one of the toughest challenges in education. One thing we learned is that it’s extremely hard to transform low-performing schools; overall they didn’t perform as well as newly created schools. We also helped the education sector learn more about what makes a school highly effective. Strong leadership, proven instructional practices, a healthy school culture, and high expectations are all key. We have also worked with districts across the country to help them improve the quality of teaching. This effort helped educators understand how to observe teachers, rate their performance fairly, and give them feedback they can act on. But we haven’t seen the large impact we had hoped for. For any new approach to take off, you need three things. First you have to run a pilot project showing that the approach works. Then the work has to sustain itself. Finally, the approach has to spread to other places. How did our teacher effectiveness work do on these three tests? Its effect on students’ learning was mixed, in part because the pilot feedback systems were implemented differently in each place. The new systems were maintained in some places, such as Memphis, but not in others. And although most educators agree that teachers deserve more-useful feedback, not enough districts are making the necessary investments and systemic changes to deliver it. To get widely adopted, an idea has to work for schools in a huge variety of settings: urban and rural, high-income and low-income, and so on. It also has to overcome the status quo. America’s schools are, by design, not a top-down system. To make significant change, you have to build consensus among a wide range of decision makers, including state governments, local school boards, administrators, teachers, and parents. Melinda: We recently announced some changes in our education work that take these lessons into account. Everything we do in education begins as an idea that educators bring to us. They’re the ones who live and breathe this work, who have dedicated their careers to improving systems that are failing many students today, especially minority students. That’s definitely true of our new strategy. We will work with networks of middle and high schools across the country to help them develop and implement their own strategies for overcoming the obstacles that keep students from succeeding. We will help these networks with the process: using key indicators of student success like grades and attendance to drive continuous learning and improvement. But the substance of the changes they make will depend on what local leaders and the available evidence say are most likely to be effective. Some networks of schools will focus on approaches that we have a lot of experience with, like stronger curricula and teacher feedback systems. Others will look at areas that are new to us, like mentoring programs to ease the difficult transitions from middle to high school and high school to college. Our role will be to support the schools as they design changes, gather and analyze data, and make adjustments over time based on what they’re learning.  3. Why don’t you give money to fight climate change? Bill: We do! Some of it involves our foundation, and some of it involves our own personal investments. Personally, we’re investing in innovations that will cut back on greenhouse gases (what’s called climate-change mitigation). The world needs new sources of reliable, affordable clean energy, but it has been dramatically underfunding the research that would produce these breakthroughs. This funding gap is different from the problems we work on at the foundation. In philanthropy, you look for problems that can’t be fixed by the market or governments. The clean-energy problem can be fixed by both—as long as governments fund basic research and create incentives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and investors are patient while companies turn that research into marketable products. That’s why I’m working on it personally rather than through our foundation. In the past two years, there’s been a lot of progress. Twenty-three countries have committed to doubling their investments in clean-energy research by 2020. Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a private investment fund I am involved with, now has more than $1 billion from a variety of investors and will fund companies in several areas (such as grid-scale storage and geothermal power) that are ripe for innovation. BEV will also be working with a coalition of other clean-energy investors to connect them with governments. Right now, public and private spending on clean energy isn’t coordinated, which is one reason some promising technologies don’t make it to market. We want to bridge that gap. Melinda: Even breakthrough technology can’t stop the weather from changing. So the world needs to adapt to what’s happening now and what we know is coming. That’s why our foundation’s work, especially in global agriculture, is increasingly focused on climate issues. Hundreds of millions of people in developing countries depend on farming for their livelihoods. They had almost nothing to do with causing climate change, but they will suffer the most from it. When extreme weather ruins their harvest, they won’t have food to eat that year. They won’t have income to spend on basic necessities like health care and school fees. For smallholder farmers, climate change is not just an ominous global trend. It is a daily emergency. Green Super Rice and Scuba Rice, which this farmer has planted, have been bred to withstand extreme weather. But just as innovation can limit climate change, it can also help people cope with it. We invest to help farmers be more productive, so that they’ll have more buffer to withstand lean years when they come. We also invest in climate-smart crops that are less susceptible to extreme heat and cold, drought and flooding, and diseases and pests. For example, we’re working with partners including the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science to develop varieties of rice that tolerate drought and require less fertilizer, herbicide, and pesticide. Innovations like this “Green Super Rice” could be key to fighting poverty and feeding the world in the decades to come.  4. Are you imposing your values on other cultures? Bill: On one level, I think the answer is obviously no. The idea that children shouldn’t die of malaria or be malnourished is not just our value. It’s a human value. Parents in every culture want their children to survive and thrive. Sometimes, though, the person asking this question is raising a deeper issue. It’s not so much a question about what we do, but how we do it. Do we really understand people’s needs? Are we working with people on the ground? Melinda: We’re acutely aware that some development programs in the past were led by people who assumed they knew better than the people they were trying to help. We’ve learned over the years that listening and understanding people’s needs from their perspective is not only more respectful—it’s also more effective. Our foundation is designed with this principle in mind. When we say “we” work on a certain issue, we don’t mean that Bill or I or the foundation’s employees are installing sewage systems in rapidly growing cities, delivering treatments for river blindness, or training farmers to rotate their crops. What we mean is that we fund organizations with years and sometimes decades of local experience that do those things. These organizations, our thousands of partners, keep us connected to the people we’re trying to help. We have about 1,500 employees in offices on four continents who look at the data, survey the universe of possible approaches, study what’s worked and what hasn’t, and develop strategies that we believe will maximize our impact. But one of the most important parts of their job is to listen to partners, adjust the strategies based on what they hear, and give implementers the leeway to use their expertise and their local knowledge. That’s not to say we always get it right. We don’t. But we try to approach our work with humility about what we don’t know and the determination to learn from our mistakes. On top of relying on local partners, we also have a strong conviction about the importance of empowerment. We aren’t interested in making choices for anyone. We invest in family planning, for example, not because we have a vision of what other people’s families should look like but because parents around the world have told us they want the tools to make their vision of their own family come to fruition. In all our work, we are interested in making sure people have the knowledge and power to make the best choices for themselves.  5. Does saving kids’ lives lead to overpopulation? Melinda: We asked ourselves the same question at first. Hans Rosling, the brilliant and inspiring public health advocate who died last year, was great at answering it. I wrote about the issue at length in our 2014 letter. But it bears repeating, because it is so counterintuitive. When more children live past the age of 5, and when mothers can decide if and when to have children, population sizes don’t go up. They go down. Parents have fewer children when they’re confident those children will survive into adulthood. Big families are in some ways an insurance policy against the tragic likelihood of losing a son or a daughter. We see this pattern throughout history. All over the world, when death rates among children go down, so do birth rates. It happened in France in the late 1700s. It happened in Germany in the late 1800s. Argentina in the 1910s, Brazil in the 1960s, Bangladesh in the 1980s. Bill: There’s another benefit to the pattern Melinda describes—first more children survive, then families decide to have fewer children—which is that it can lead to a burst of economic growth that economists call “the demographic dividend.” Here’s how it works. When more children live, you get one generation that’s relatively big. Then, when families decide to have fewer children, the next generation is much smaller. Eventually, a country ends up with relatively more people in the labor force producing economically—and relatively fewer dependents (very old or very young people). That’s a recipe for rapid economic development, especially if countries take advantage of it by investing in health and education. Fortunately, the number of child deaths is likely to keep going down. The rate of innovation in child health is extraordinary, and the world is starting to make progress on some of the most stubborn challenges in the field. For example, we now know that malnutrition is a contributing factor in half of all child deaths, but there are still many open questions about what causes malnutrition and how to prevent it. One promising area is the study of the microbiome—all the bacteria in the human gut—and the role it plays in kids’ ability to absorb nutrients. We’re also working with a partner on a device that’s the thickness of a piece of string that can go down infants’ noses and take 360-degree microscopic pictures of the gut. Soon, we’ll be able to see how a child is developing, instead of having to guess. Melinda: Saving the lives of children is its own justification. It also has the potential to improve life for everyone. But this demographic transition can happen in a reasonable period of time only if all women have access to contraceptives. Right now, more than 200 million don’t. For the sake of those women, their children, and their communities, we must meet their needs—and we must do it now. If we deny access, we are dooming them to a lifetime of poverty. But if we invest in providing access, families will use it to lift themselves out of poverty and build a better future for their children.  6. How are President Trump’s policies affecting your foundation’s work? Bill: In the past year, I’ve been asked about President Trump and his policies more often than all the other topics in this letter combined. The administration’s policies affect our foundation’s work in a number of areas. The most concrete example is foreign aid. For decades the United States has been a leader in the fight against disease and poverty abroad. These efforts save lives. They also create U.S. jobs. And they make Americans more secure by making poor countries more stable and stopping disease outbreaks before they become pandemics. The world is not a safer place when more people are sick or hungry. President Trump proposed severe cuts to foreign aid. To its credit, Congress has moved to put the money back in the budget. It’s better for the United States when it leads, through both hard power and soft power. More broadly, the America First worldview concerns me. It’s not that the United States shouldn’t look out for its people. The question is how best to do that. My view is that engaging with the world has proven over time to benefit everyone, including Americans, more than withdrawing does. Even if we measured everything the government did only by how much it helped American citizens, global engagement would still be a smart investment. We have met with President Trump and his team, just as we have met with people in previous administrations. With every administration—Republican and Democrat—we agree on some things and disagree on others. Although we disagree with this administration more than the others we’ve met with, we believe it's still important to work together whenever possible. We keep talking to them because if the U.S. cuts back on its investments abroad, people in other countries will die, and Americans will be worse off. Melinda: We need to work with the administration to garner as much support as we can for policies that will benefit the most impoverished people in the world. In our U.S. work, one premise we start with is that a college degree or career certificate is critical to a successful future. In short, a college education should be a pathway to prosperity for all Americans. The Trump administration’s leadership, along with Congress’s, will have a lot to do with whether it is. Specifically, student aid programs need to work better for low-income students. Right now, 2 million students who are eligible for aid don’t even apply for it, because the process is so burdensome. Some go into debt. Even worse, many don’t go to college at all. The government must continue to be generous in funding aid programs while following through on simplifying the application process. The futures of millions of young Americans are on the line. I would also say that I believe one of the duties of the president of the United States is to role model American values in the world. I wish our president would treat people, and especially women, with more respect when he speaks and tweets. Equality is an important national principle. The sanctity of each individual, regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, or gender, is part of our country’s spirit. The president has a responsibility to set a good example and empower all Americans through his statements and his policies.  7. Why do you work with corporations? Melinda: We work with companies like GSK and Johnson & Johnson because they can do things no one else can. Take the example of developing new diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines for diseases of poverty. The basic science that underlies product development happens at research centers and universities. But when the goal is to build upon basic science, translate it into products that save lives, get those products tested and approved, and then manufacture those products, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have the vast majority of the necessary expertise. Every partner we work with is required to make products developed with foundation funding widely available at an affordable price. Ideally, we’d like companies to seek out more opportunities to meet the needs of people in developing countries. If our limited partnerships encourage them to see potential in new markets, we’d consider it a big success. Bill: We think poor people should benefit from the same kind of innovation in health and agriculture that has improved life in the richest parts of the world. Much of that innovation comes out of the private sector. But companies have to make a return on their investments, which means they have little incentive to work on problems that mainly affect the world’s poorest people. We’re trying to change that—to encourage companies to focus a bit of their expertise on the problems of the poor without asking them to lose money along the way. The best examples so far are in global health. Some diseases of the poor require new vaccines and drugs, which as Melinda says is an area where biotech companies excel. So, for instance, we’re funding two early-stage companies that are working on ways to use messenger RNA to teach your body how to produce its own vaccines. It could lead to breakthroughs in HIV and malaria—as well as flu and even cancer. We’re also working with the private sector to make existing drugs and vaccines available to people in poor countries. There is a group of more than a dozen awful diseases, known collectively as neglected tropical diseases, that affect more than 1.5 billion people. Most of these diseases can be treated, but the drugs are too expensive for the poorest countries to buy and deliver to their people. Several years ago, we learned that a few pharmaceutical companies were donating the necessary drugs. We loved the idea and helped bring together a larger group of companies to donate even more. In 2016 they provided treatment for at least one of these diseases to 1 billion people in 130 countries. I’m optimistic that we can eliminate a number of neglected tropical diseases in the next decade, and this work is one reason why. Sometimes we use more complex financial deals to bring in the private sector. For example, donors can remove some of the risk for companies by guaranteeing them that they will either get a certain price for their product or sell a certain volume of it. We are one of several donors that created a price guarantee to scale up the delivery of a vaccine for pneumococcal disease, an infection that kills nearly half a million children every year. Poor children in 57 countries now get this vaccine, and it could save 1.5 million lives by 2020. We’re also working with the private sector in other areas, but those efforts aren’t as far along. Agriculture companies like Monsanto are making seeds that could help farmers in poor countries grow more food, earn more money, and (as Melinda mentioned earlier) adapt to climate change. And we’re working with mobile-phone providers like Vodafone so that more poor people can save money, make payments, and borrow through their phone. This work took off initially in Kenya and is now expanding to other countries, including India.  8. Is it fair that you have so much influence? Melinda: No. It’s not fair that we have so much wealth when billions of others have so little. And it’s not fair that our wealth opens doors that are closed to most people. World leaders tend to take our phone calls and seriously consider what we have to say. Cash-strapped school districts are more likely to divert money and talent toward ideas they think we will fund. But there is nothing secret about our objectives as a foundation. We are committed to being open about what we fund and what the results have been. (It’s not always immediately clear what’s been successful and what hasn’t, but we work hard to assess our impact, course correct, and share lessons.) We do this work, and use whatever influence we have, to help as many people as possible and to advance equity around the world. Although we’ve had some success, I think it would be hard to argue at this point that we made the world focus too much on health, education, or poverty. Bill: As much as we try to encourage feedback, we know that some of our critics don’t speak up because they don’t want to risk losing money. That means we need to hire well, consult experts, learn constantly, and seek out different viewpoints. Even though our foundation is the biggest in the world, the money we have is very small compared to what businesses and governments spend. For example, California spends more than our entire endowment just to run its public school system for one year. So we use our resources in a very specific way: to test out promising innovations, collect and analyze the data, and let businesses and governments scale up and sustain what works. We’re like an incubator in that way. We aim to improve the quality of the ideas that go into public policies and to steer funding toward those ideas that have the most impact. There’s another issue at the heart of this question. If we think it’s unfair that we have so much wealth, why don’t we give it all to the government? The answer is that we think there’s always going to be a unique role for foundations. They’re able to take a global view to find the greatest needs, take a long-term approach to solving problems, and manage high-risk projects that governments can’t take on and corporations won’t. If a government tries an idea that fails, someone wasn’t doing their job. Whereas if we don’t try some ideas that fail, we’re not doing our jobs.  9. What happens when the two of you disagree? Melinda: We never disagree. Just kidding. Bill almost never gets this question. I get it all the time. Sometimes, it’s from journalists hinting that Bill must be the one making the decisions. Other times, it’s from women philanthropists asking advice about how to work more effectively with their husbands. Bill and I have two things going in our favor. First, we agree on basic values. For our wedding, Bill’s parents gave us a sculpture of two birds side by side, staring at the horizon, and it’s still in front of our house. I think of it all the time, because fundamentally we’re looking in the same direction. Second, Bill is very open-minded, which isn’t necessarily how people perceive him. I love Bill because he has a kind heart, listens to other people, and lets himself be moved by what they say. When I tell a story about what I’ve seen, he feels it. He might ask me to gather some data for good measure, but he doesn’t doubt the reality of my experiences or the soundness of my judgment. Sharing a laugh with the Zhou Mingting family in Hainan, China. When Bill first came over to the foundation from Microsoft, he was used to being in charge. I’d stayed home with our kids, so I was restarting my career. There were times I felt that disparity—in meetings when I was reticent and he was voluble, or when the person we were meeting with looked toward Bill and not me. It’s always been important to us that we are equal partners in our foundation’s work. We’ve learned over time to give each other feedback at home about times in the office when we didn’t meet that goal. Gradually, I’ve focused more and more on gender issues, because I’ve seen repeatedly that the more empowered women and girls are, the stronger their communities are. As I’ve thought more deeply about equality for women around the world, I’ve been proud that Bill and I have achieved it in our life together. This is a balance that married couples, and co-workers, all over the world are always trying to strike. One of the reasons this work has been so fun for me is that we’ve been on this journey together. Bill: I agree with all of this! Though I have to admit that Melinda is more comfortable with—and better at—talking in public about personal subjects than I am. As she says, our common values serve us well. We agree on the big issues. Our occasional disagreements these days are over tactics. Because I've been a public figure longer, and because I’m a man, some people assume I am making the big decisions. That's never been the case. Some people see Melinda as the heart of our foundation, the emotional core. But just as she knows I’m more emotional than people realize, I know she’s more analytical than people realize. When I get really enthusiastic about something, I count on her to make sure I’m being realistic. I also love watching her bring together just the right mix of people to solve a problem. She helps me understand when I can push our teams harder (as I pretty much always did at Microsoft) and when I need to ease off. We are partners in both senses that people use the word these days: at home and at work.",true/false
62,"A U.S. ambassador on Wednesday explicitly linked President Trump, Vice President Pence and other senior officials to what he came to believe was a campaign to pressure a foreign government to investigate Trump’s political rival in exchange for a coveted White House meeting and hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid. The potentially historic, if hotly disputed, testimony from U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland is the most damaging yet for Trump in Congress’s intensifying inquiry into whether the president should be impeached. More forcefully than he has before, Sondland declared that the Trump administration would not give Ukraine’s newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, a chance to visit the White House — unless Zelensky agreed to announce investigations that could help the president politically. “I know that members of this committee frequently frame these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a ‘quid pro quo’?” Sondland said. “. . . With regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes.” Sondland came to Capitol Hill as perhaps the most anticipated witness of the Democrats’ inquiry — a longtime Republican donor and Trump loyalist whose shifting accounts made it unclear which side of the political aisle his testimony might benefit more. He said after the hearing that he intended to stay in his post. But nearly from the moment his testimony began, it was clear he was ready to cast aspersions not just on the president, but also on the highest-ranking officials in his government. Sondland acknowledged that he and others were the ones pushing Ukrainians to announce investigations, but asserted they had merely “followed the president’s orders,” communicated through Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. Sondland testified that top-level officials — including Pence, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — were made aware at various points of what was happening, and he provided emails to back up his assertions.",true/false
63,"A pause on all US vaccinations with the Johnson & Johnson Covid shot will continue for at least another week after members of a government-convened expert panel said Wednesday they needed more time to assess its possible links to a clotting disorder.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) convened a meeting a day after authorities reported six cases of women developing brain clots along with low blood platelet counts, including one death, within two weeks of people getting the one-dose Covid-19 vaccine.  The shot has been given to some 7.2 million Americans, and participants at the meeting were told on Wednesday a seventh case involving a 28-year-old woman has been identified.  Wednesday's meeting could have decided whether to limit the vaccine to some subsets of the population, but most members said they were not yet comfortable in making that call without more data to study.  ""I don't want to send the message that there is something fundamentally wrong with this vaccine,"" said Beth Bell, chair of the working group.  ""But I want to be able to understand and defend the decision that I've made based on a reasonable amount of data,"" she added.  The next meeting has not yet been set but is expected in another week to ten days.  Some experts were against continuing the pause, fearing it might disproportionately impact vulnerable groups that are easier to reach through a single-dose vaccine that can be stored in fridges.  But most felt that given the highly serious nature of the clots, which can have devastating neurological consequences even when they do not kill, and given the abundance in the United States of other vaccines that do not have the same safety concern, further study was necessary.  The presentations revealed that of the first six cases identified, all were white females, none had previously known clotting disorders, and one was using estrogen/progesterone, taken to mean oral contraceptive.  Story continues  The woman who died was 45, and three of the women also had clots outside the brain.  Though the link to the vaccine has yet to be conclusively determined, scientists are now treating the shot as the ""probable cause"" of the disorder, which has been dubbed ""vaccine induced immune thrombocytopenia"" or ""VIIT.""  Ahead of the meeting, CDC director Rochelle Walensky said the symptoms are consistent with rare side effects from the AstraZeneca vaccine seen in Europe.  Both the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines are based on adenovirus vector technology, which is now under scrutiny.  Other Covid adenovirus vector vaccines include Russia's Sputnik V and China's CanSino.  People who received the J&J vaccine are being urged to report if they experience symptoms including severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain or shortness of breath.  Doctors meanwhile have been told not to treat such clots with the common thinner heparin.  Four of the initial six cases were treated using heparin, and this might have made their condition worse, according to the leading biological hypothesis for what is driving the effect.  Cases involving clots together with low platelets have not been linked to the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, which are based on messenger RNA technology.  When the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices reconvenes, it could potentially vote to recommend that only people beyond a certain age receive the J&J vaccine.  The reasoning is that the older people get, the more they risk developing a serious form of Covid, and the more it is in their interest to be vaccinated despite potential side effects.  But US officials have also emphasized that they have more than enough supply lined up of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines to cover the adult population by the end of July, which could make giving the J&J shot the green light again unnecessary.  ia/dw",true/false
64,"Advertisement  President Joe Biden flew to northern Delaware Friday night and departed Sunday night. The weekend visit included a round of golf and the confirmation of his grandson.  The president, wearing a cap from the Beau Biden Foundation, hit the links at the Wilmington Country Club on Saturday. The foundation, formed in honor of the president’s late son and former Delware Attorney General, focuses on childrens issues.  Advertisement  Golf partners were Ron Olivere and Steve Ricchett. Olivere is the father of Beau Biden’s widow Hallie.  Biden is a member of the club located near his home in the Greenville area.  Pool reporters shouted out questions to Biden about the refugee situation.  It was the president’s first golf outing since taking office in January. In the past, Biden was known as one of the better golfers on the Washington, D.C. political scene.  On Sunday, Joe and Jill Biden attended the confirmation of his grandson Hunter Biden II at St. Joseph on the Brandywine II and visited a residence in Greenville.  The Cape Gazette reported Saturday that the First Lady had been staying at the family’s second home near Rehoboth Beach after undergoing a medical procedure that went well. It did not appear that the president had traveled to Rehoboth.  Ocean City, MD business owners have been concerned about being able to tow banner advertisng due to possible flight bans over beach areas should the Bidens stay at the residence during the summer.  The Cape Gazette earlier reported that a landing pad is available for the president at a nearby state park’s parking lot.  Joe Biden has been criticized for frequent weekend trips from the White House to Delaware from some motorists who get caught up in the delays, those who believe he should not travel during the pandemic, or some who see such travel as too costly.  The sentiments surface on Facebook pages of news sites and also include supporters chiming in. Biden supporters point to the frequent trips of his predecessor Donald Trump to his golf resort on the Florida coast as well as golfing in Washington, D.C. area and at his New Jersey country club.  Perhaps out of concern about traffic tie-ups that have been featured in the News Journal, Biden departed to Washington, D.C. Sunday night, arriving at the White House at around 9:30 p.m. via Marine One. He departed the White House early Friday night, arriving at New Castle Airport, with a small motorcade taking him to his residence.  The Delaware route to and from his home was recently in the news when the Coast Guard asked for a security designation for the Christina River. A crossing over the river is on the motorcade route.  The visits do have a modest economic impact on Wilmington, thanks to a small press corps that travels with the president. The visits continue to raise the profile of Wilmington as reporters use the city as a backdrop.  Recently the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised that travel is a low-risk activity for vaccinated Americans. In Delaware about 40 percent of the state’s population has received at least one shot.  The president’s Friday schedule included an in-person visit from the Prime Minister of Japan who asked Pfizer for more vaccine.",true/false
65,"The flag of the Interior Department's deputy secretary, bottom, flew last week above the headquarters building in downtown Washington. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)  At the Interior Department’s headquarters in downtown Washington, Secretary Ryan Zinke has revived an arcane military ritual that no one can remember ever happening in the federal government.  A security staffer takes the elevator to the seventh floor, climbs the stairs to the roof and hoists a special secretarial flag whenever Zinke enters the building. When the secretary goes home for the day or travels, the flag — a blue banner emblazoned with the agency’s bison seal flanked by seven white stars representing the Interior bureaus — comes down.  In Zinke’s absence, the ritual is repeated to raise an equally obscure flag for Deputy Secretary David Bernhardt.  Responding this week to questions from The Washington Post, a spokeswoman for Zinke, a former Navy SEAL commander, defended the Navy flag-flying tradition as “a major sign of transparency.”  “Ryan Zinke is proud and honored to lead the Department of the Interior, and is restoring honor and tradition to the department, whether it’s flying the flag when he is in garrison or restoring traditional access to public lands,” press secretary Heather Swift said in an email.    Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke speaks at the Heritage Foundation in Washington last month. At right is his special secretarial flag. (Zach Gibson/Bloomberg News)  Zinke, a Stetson-wearing former Montana congressman who has cultivated an image as a rugged outdoorsman, has come under a harsh spotlight in recent weeks for behavior criticized as extravagant for a public official. The agency’s inspector general opened an investigation after he ran up bills for travel on chartered jets and mixed business with political appearances, sometimes accompanied by his wife, Lola. It’s one of five probes underway of Cabinet secretaries’ travel.  Zinke upset some of the 70,000 employees at the agency that manages public lands by stating that 30 percent of the workers are “not loyal to the flag” in a speech to oil and gas executives. It is unclear whether the reference was literal or figurative.  Zinke rode to work on horseback on his first day in office and displays animal heads on his wood-paneled office walls. For a while, he kept a glass-case display of hunting knives but was asked to remove them because of security risks, according to people familiar with the decision.  He has commissioned commemorative coins with his name on them to give to staff and visitors, but the cost to taxpayers is unclear. Zinke’s predecessors and some other Cabinet secretaries have coins bearing agency seals, but not personalized ones.  The flag ritual is unique in President Trump’s administration. The White House does not raise the presidential flag when Trump alights at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. There is no defense secretary’s flag atop the Pentagon.  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, like his predecessors, has a personal flag that flies beside the U.S. flag in front of the department’s Foggy Bottom headquarters. But it’s there whether Tillerson is in the building or not.  “We’re talking about Cabinet members and federal buildings, not the Queen of England and Buckingham Palace,” said Chris Lu, deputy labor secretary in the Obama administration, referring to the British tradition of announcing the queen’s presence by raising her personal heraldic flag.    Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke commissioned commemorative coins with his name on them to give to staff and visitors. (Obtained by The Washington Post)  “If we had a secretarial flag at the Obama Labor Department, we never bothered to locate it or use it,” Lu said.  Retired Army Col. Steven Warren, who ran the Pentagon’s press operation before retiring this year, could not recall the place in Washington hierarchy represented by the raising of a federal official’s personal flag.  “Is he trying to send a message?” Warren wondered.  “Is he big on pomp and circumstance, or is this a case of ‘Look at me?’ ”  Personal flags for federal government officials have a proud, if arcane, history that originated with the secretary of the Navy in 1866, to help sailing ships in the fleet recognize which one carried the naval commander. The Coast Guard and secretary of war wanted one, too.  By the early 20th century, the civilian heads of the Treasury, Commerce and Labor departments had flags.  The first one for Interior was adopted in 1917.  “If you were the secretary of agriculture, you asked yourself, ‘Hey, the secretary of war has a flag, how come I don’t have one?’ ” said Joseph McMillan, a retired Defense Department official and student of flag history from Alexandria who is president of the American Heraldry Society.  The flags proliferated by World War II, with banners for subordinate officials from undersecretaries to assistant attorneys general.  Back when security was not a concern, official government vehicles would display a high-ranking official’s personal flag on its left front fender, with the American flag flanking the right. They were considered pretentious, McMillan said, and eventually went out of fashion.  At Lady Liberty Flag and Flagpole in Austin, one of the largest flag vendors for federal offices, Sandra Dee Merritt said she sells 300 to 500 department flags a year to various Interior offices.  Secretarial flags are no longer in demand. “I haven’t sold any of those individual secretarial flags to any agency in forever,” Merritt said.  Raising a personal flag to mark an official’s presence remains a custom in the military. Field commanders often display their unit’s flag when they are at headquarters to signify that the boss is in.  But the personal flag, whether belonging to a general or a Cabinet secretary, stays behind the desk, if it’s there at all.  By flying his flag, Zinke is doing exactly what the flag was designed for, McMillan said. Yet he’s skeptical. The Interior Department is not the Navy.  “I’m all about tradition,” McMillan said. “But I kind of have an aversion to militarizing everything in our government. The world doesn’t need to know the secretary of the Interior is in the building.”",true/false
66,"""This idea that we have the power to protect the vulnerable is total nonsense.""  A pandemic of the novel coronavirus has now killed more than 1 million people worldwide.  Over 38.8 million people across the globe have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new respiratory virus, according to data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. The criteria for diagnosis -- through clinical means or a lab test -- has varied from country-to-country. Still, the actual numbers are believed to be much higher due to testing shortages, many unreported cases and suspicions that some national governments are hiding or downplaying the scope of their outbreaks.  Since the first cases were detected in China in December, the virus has rapidly spread to every continent except Antarctica.  The United States is the worst-affected country, with more than 7.9 million diagnosed cases and at least 217,721 deaths.  California has the most cases of any U.S. state, with more than 866,000 people diagnosed, according to Johns Hopkins data. California is followed by Texas and Florida, with over 836,000 cases and over 744,000 cases, respectively.  More than 190 vaccine candidates for COVID-19 are being tracked by the World Health Organization, at least 10 of which are in crucial phase three studies. Of those 10 potential vaccines in late-stage trials, there are currently five that will be available in the United States if approved.",true/false

68,"Mike Bloomberg has been plunged into fresh controversy over his comments on race and transgender people, as scrutiny intensifies over the presidential candidate’s past remarks ahead of his Democratic debate debut. On Tuesday, a 2011 PBS interview resurfaced in which Bloomberg stated that there was an “enormous cohort of black and Latino males” who “don’t know how to behave in the workplace”. And separately, a newly uncovered video from March 2019 showed Bloomberg describing trans rights as being about “some guy wearing a dress and whether he, she, or it can go to the locker room with their daughter”. The comments re-emerged as the multibillionaire media mogul faces questions over his other past remarks on race and women, and as he secured a presence in the televised Democratic debates for the first time. A NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll published on Tuesday shows Bloomberg with 19% support among Democrats for the presidential nomination, enough to join the debate stage alongside other leading contenders in Las Vegas on Wednesday. In the PBS interview, Bloomberg, who was then mayor of New York City, said he supported a program to boost employment prospects for minorities and lamented that “blacks and Latinos score terribly in school testing compared to whites and Asians. If you look at our jails, it’s predominantly minorities.” Bloomberg said some progress had been made but “nevertheless, there’s this enormous cohort of black and Latino males, age, let’s say, 16 to 25, that don’t have jobs, don’t have any prospects, don’t know how to find jobs, don’t know what their skillsets are, don’t know how to behave in the workplace where they have to work collaboratively and collectively”. The former mayor added that crime in New York City takes place in “minority neighborhoods”, with victims and perpetrators of crime “virtually all minorities”. In a March 2019 video, first reported by BuzzFeed News, Bloomberg criticized Democrats for focusing on transgender rights, saying it was “not a winning formula for most people”. “If your conversation during a presidential election is about some guy wearing a dress and whether he, she, or it can go to the locker room with their daughter, that’s not a winning formula for most people. They care about healthcare, they care about education, they care about safety, and all of those kinds of things.” The revelation comes on the same day Bloomberg’s campaign released a video touting the former New York mayor’s record on LGBTQ issues, BuzzFeed notes. Bloomberg has achieved solid polling numbers despite several previous interviews and comments coming to light that have been viewed as highly problematic. An audio clip of Bloomberg defending his “stop-and-frisk” approach to policing in New York from 2015 featured the former mayor attributing 95% of murders to “male minorities, 16 to 25”. He added: “You can just take the description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops.” Bloomberg has previously apologized for the use of stop-and-frisk, saying it was “overused” in New York. His rivals for the Democratic nomination, in particular the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, have accused Bloomberg of being out of step with voters and guilty of attempting to buy the nomination via his vast wealth. Bloomberg will appear on stage in Wednesday’s debate in Las Vegas alongside former vice-president Joe Biden, Sanders, senators Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar and the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg. Fellow billionaire and philanthropist Tom Steyer is still hoping to qualify. The Democratic National Committee recently changed its rules for how a candidate qualifies for the debate, opening the door for Bloomberg to be on stage and drawing the ire of some candidates who dropped out of the race for failing to make prior stages. The candidates were previously required to receive a certain number of campaign contributions to qualify, but Bloomberg, who is worth an estimated $60bn, is not taking donations. The primetime event will be a stark departure from Bloomberg’s highly choreographed campaign. He has poured more than $300m into television advertising, a way to define himself for voters without facing criticism. Bloomberg has barely crossed paths on the trail with his fellow Democrats. He decided to skip the first four voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina in favor of focusing on the 14 states that vote on 3 March and the contests that come afterward. He rarely mentions his rivals by name, though his campaign is centered on the idea that none of them can beat Donald Trump. The Associated Press contributed to this report",true/false

The number of full-time police officers has fallen over the past year, while the SNP’s failure to fully fund their promise of 1000 extra officers has resulted in frontline officers having to fill back-office functions rather than being out on the beat. Under a Labour ­government, Scotland will receive £70million which we can use to ensure officers can focus on policing and protecting our communities. TRANSPORT (Image: Getty) Major road-building projects have been delayed, bus services are ­deteriorating and satisfaction with ScotRail is at a 14-year low. Instead of listening to Labour and creating a publicly owned rail service, the SNP handed the ScotRail franchise to the Dutch state ­operator Abellio. This has led to passengers suffering delays, cancellations, ­overcrowding and fare increases. Labour will always protect pensioners’ free bus pass from the age of 60. The truth is that nobody can trust a word of the SNP manifesto that Sturgeon will unveil today. Voters who want to send her a message to drop plans for a divisive second independence referendum and focus on running our schools and hospitals need to vote Labour on June 8.",true/false
70,"T hree people have died in Scotland due to coronavirus vaccine adverse-effects, latest official data shows.  National Records of Scotland (NRS) published a new report, saying: “There have been three deaths in Scotland where the underlying cause of death was adverse effects of Covid-19 vaccines.”  NRS said the deaths were in the context of 2.81 million people having been given at least one dose of a vaccine by April 30, according to figures from Public Health Scotland.  Meanwhile, the latest figures from the NRS show there were six fatalities where coronavirus was recorded as an underlying cause between May 10 and May 16, a drop of one on the previous week.  The data also shows that post-coronavirus conditions, including long Covid, were mentioned on 11 death certificates in the period from March 2020 to April 2021.  In the six deaths from May 10 and 16, five involved people aged under 65 and the sixth was someone aged 75 or over.  North Lanarkshire recorded three of the deaths, Glasgow saw two, and Perth and Kinross recorded one.  This means deaths occurred in three of Scotland’s 32 council areas.  Pete Whitehouse, NRS director of statistical services, said: “Last week there were no registered Covid-19 deaths in 29 of Scotland’s 32 council areas. Across Scotland, six Covid-19 deaths were registered which is the lowest number since early September last year.  “The report also shows that deaths from Covid-19 continues to have a greater impact on people living in Scotland’s more deprived communities.  “Over the course of the pandemic, people living in these most deprived areas are 2.4 times as likely to die with Covid-19 than those living in the least deprived areas after adjusting for age.”  Four deaths occurred in hospital, one in a care home, and one in a non-institutional setting such as at home.  A total of 10,109 deaths have now been registered in Scotland where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate.  Meanwhile, the latest daily figures show Scotland has recorded 394 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours.  The Scottish Government figures show no new fatalities have been recorded, meaning the death toll under this daily measure – of people who first tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days – remains at 7,664.  A total of 230,436 people have tested positive for the virus and the daily test positivity rate is 1.6%, down from 1.7% the previous day.  There were 78 people in hospital on Tuesday with recently confirmed Covid-19, up from 70, with four in intensive care – which is unchanged.  A total of 3,051,383 people have now received the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and 1,704,388 have had their second.  There are contrasting updates for the two local authorities in Scotland that remain under Level 3 restrictions.  New figures from Public Health Scotland show there were 109.9 cases per 100,000 people in Glasgow on Sunday using the seven-day positive test rate.  This was up from 105 per 100,000 on the previous day.  Moray’s positivity rate had fallen from 48 per 100,000 to 40.7, while Level 2 East Renfrewshire recorded a rate of 101.5 per 100,000 – up from 94.2.",true/false
71,"President Trump has sometimes claimed that scientists are engaged in a worldwide hoax to fool the public, or that global warming was invented by China to disable American industry. The climate denialists’ arguments have become so strained that even oil and coal companies have distanced themselves publicly, though some still help to finance the campaigns of politicians who espouse such views.  Instead of negotiating over climate change policies and trying to make them more market-oriented, some political conservatives have taken the approach of blocking them by trying to undermine the science.  In theory, they could be. If the sun were to start putting out more radiation, for instance, that would definitely warm the Earth. But scientists have looked carefully at the natural factors known to influence planetary temperature and found that they are not changing nearly enough. The warming is extremely rapid on the geologic time scale, and no other factor can explain it as well as human emissions of greenhouse gases.  Could natural factors be the cause of the warming?  5. Could natural factors be the cause of the warming?  Hard evidence, including studies that use radioactivity to distinguish industrial emissions from natural emissions, shows that the extra gas is coming from human activity. Carbon dioxide levels rose and fell naturally in the long-ago past, but those changes took thousands of years. Geologists say that humans are now pumping the gas into the air much faster than nature has ever done.  How do we know humans are responsible for the increase in carbon dioxide?  4. How do we know humans are responsible for the increase in carbon dioxide?  Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.  In the 19th century, scientists discovered that certain gases in the air trap and slow down heat that would otherwise escape to space. Carbon dioxide is a major player; without any of it in the air, the Earth would be a frozen wasteland. The first prediction that the planet would warm as humans released more of the gas was made in 1896. The gas has increased 43 percent above the pre-industrial level so far, and the Earth has warmed by roughly the amount that scientists predicted it would.  We’ve known about it for more than a century. Really.  What is the greenhouse effect, and how does it cause global warming?  3. What is the greenhouse effect, and how does it cause global warming?  As of early 2017, the Earth had warmed by roughly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (more than 1 degree Celsius) since 1880, when records began at a global scale. The number may sound low, but as an average over the surface of an entire planet, it is actually high, which explains why much of the world’s land ice is starting to melt and the oceans are rising at an accelerating pace. If greenhouse gas emissions continue unchecked, scientists say, the global warming could ultimately exceed 8 degrees Fahrenheit, which would undermine the planet’s capacity to support a large human population.  President Trump has claimed that scientists stopped referring to global warming and started calling it climate change because “the weather has been so cold” in winter. But the claim is false. Scientists have used both terms for decades.  You can think of global warming as one type of climate change. The broader term covers changes beyond warmer temperatures, such as shifting rainfall patterns.  Both are accurate, but they mean different things.  In many other cases, though — hurricanes, for example — the linkage to global warming for particular trends is uncertain or disputed. Scientists are gradually improving their understanding as computer analyses of the climate grow more powerful.  Scientists have published strong evidence that the warming climate is making heat waves more frequent and intense . It is also causing heavier rainstorms , and coastal flooding is getting worse as the oceans rise because of human emissions. Global warming has intensified droughts in regions like the Middle East, and it may have strengthened a recent drought in California.  The risk is that the rate will increase still more. Scientists who study the Earth’s history say waters could rise by a foot per decade in a worst-case scenario, though that looks unlikely. Many experts believe that even if emissions stopped tomorrow, 15 or 20 feet of sea level rise is already inevitable, enough to flood many cities unless trillions of dollars are spent protecting them. How long it will take is unclear. But if emissions continue apace, the ultimate rise could be 80 or 100 feet.  The ocean has accelerated and is now rising at a rate of about a foot per century, forcing governments and property owners to spend tens of billions of dollars fighting coastal erosion. But if that rate continued, it would probably be manageable, experts say.  The simple reality is that people are already feeling the effects, whether they know it or not. Because of sea level rise, for instance, some 83,000 more residents of New York and New Jersey were flooded during Hurricane Sandy than would have been the case in a stable climate, scientists have calculated. Tens of thousands of people are already dying in heat waves made worse by global warming. The refugee flows that have destabilized politics around the world have been traced in part to climate change. Of course, as with almost all other social problems, poor people will be hit first and hardest.  Over the coming 25 or 30 years, scientists say, the climate is likely to gradually warm, with more extreme weather. Coral reefs and other sensitive habitats are already starting to die . Longer term, if emissions rise unchecked, scientists fear climate effects so severe that they might destabilize governments, produce waves of refugees , precipitate the sixth mass extinction of plants and animals in the Earth’s history, and melt the polar ice caps, causing the seas to rise high enough to flood most of the world’s coastal cities. The emissions that create those risks are happening now, raising deep moral questions for our generation.  1. Are there any realistic solutions to the problem?  Yes, but change is happening too slowly.  Society has put off action for so long that the risks are now severe, scientists say. But as long as there are still unburned fossil fuels in the ground, it is not too late to act. The warming will slow to a potentially manageable pace only when human emissions are reduced to zero. The good news is that they are now falling in many countries as a result of programs like fuel-economy standards for cars, stricter building codes and emissions limits for power plants. But experts say the energy transition needs to speed up drastically to head off the worst effects of climate change.  2. What is the Paris Agreement?  Virtually every country agreed to limit future emissions.  The landmark deal was reached outside Paris in December 2015. The reductions are voluntary and the pledges do not do enough to head off severe effects. But the agreement is supposed to be reviewed every few years so that countries ramp up their commitments. President Trump announced in 2017 that he would pull the United States out of the deal, though that will take years, and other countries have said they would go forward regardless of American intentions.  3. Does clean energy help or hurt the economy?  Job growth in renewable energy is strong.  The energy sources with the lowest emissions include wind turbines, solar panels, hydroelectric dams and nuclear power stations. Power plants burning natural gas also produce fewer emissions than those burning coal. Converting to these cleaner sources may be somewhat costlier in the short term, but they could ultimately pay for themselves by heading off climate damages and reducing health problems associated with dirty air. And expansion of the market is driving down the costs of renewable energy so fast that it may ultimately beat dirty energy on price alone — it already does in some areas.  The transition to cleaner energy certainly produces losers, like coal companies, but it also creates jobs. The solar industry in the United States now employs more than twice as many people as coal mining.  4. What about fracking or ‘clean coal’?  Both could help clean up the energy system.  Hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” is one of a set of drilling technologies that has helped produce a new abundance of natural gas in the United States and some other countries. Burning gas instead of coal in power plants reduces emissions in the short run, though gas is still a fossil fuel and will have to be phased out in the long run. The fracking itself can also create local pollution.  “Clean coal” is an approach in which the emissions from coal-burning power plants would be captured and pumped underground. It has yet to be proven to work economically, but some experts think it could eventually play a major role.  5. What’s the latest with electric cars?  Sales are still small overall, but they are rising fast.  The cars draw power at night from the electric grid and give off no pollution during the day as they move around town. They are inherently more efficient than gasoline cars and would represent an advance even if the power were generated by burning coal, but they will be far more important as the electric grid itself becomes greener through renewable power. The cars are improving so fast that some countries are already talking about banning the sale of gasoline cars after 2030.  6. What are carbon taxes, carbon trading and carbon offsets?  It’s just jargon for putting a price on pollution.  The greenhouse gases being released by human activity are often called “carbon emissions” for short. That is because two of the most important gases, carbon dioxide and methane, contain carbon. (Some other pollutants are lumped into the same category, even if they do not actually contain carbon.) When you hear about carbon taxes, carbon trading and so on, these are just shorthand descriptions of methods to put a price on emissions, which economists say is one of the most important steps society could take to limit them.  7. Climate change seems so overwhelming. What can I personally do about it?  Start by sharing this with 50 of your friends.  Experts say the problem can only be solved by large-scale, collective action. Entire states and nations have to decide to clean up their energy systems, using every tool available and moving as quickly as they can. So the most important thing you can do is to exercise your rights as a citizen, speaking up and demanding change.  You can also take direct personal action to reduce your carbon footprint in simple ways that will save you money. You can plug leaks in your home insulation to save power, install a smart thermostat, switch to more efficient light bulbs, turn off unused lights, drive fewer miles by consolidating trips or taking public transit, waste less food, and eat less meat.  Taking one or two fewer plane rides per year can save as much in emissions as all the other actions combined. If you want to be at the cutting edge, you can look at buying an electric or hybrid car or putting solar panels on your roof. If your state has a competitive electricity market, you may be able to buy 100 percent green power.  Leading corporations, including large manufacturers like carmakers, are starting to demand clean energy for their operations. You can pay attention to company policies, support the companies taking the lead, and let the others know you expect them to do better.",true/false
72,"CBC News has obtained an unredacted copy of a lawsuit launched by an anti-vaccination advocacy group against the government response to the coronavirus crisis, the details of which can now be independently verified and publicly reported for the first time.  The lawsuit was filed July 6 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Toronto by Aylmer, Ont.-based Vaccine Choice Canada and seven individuals. The legal action is a challenge under Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms to the country's pandemic response measures, including compulsory face masks, the closure of businesses and the enforcement of physical distancing.  The plaintiffs are suing the governments of Canada and Ontario, the City of Toronto, senior politicians, a number of local Ontario health authorities, health officials and the CBC over their response to the pandemic.  The suit states that the closure of businesses to prevent the spread of the virus was ""extreme, unwarranted and unjustified,"" that self-isolation measures imposed on individuals were ""not scientific, nor medically based nor proven"" and that the mandatory wearing of face coverings in some public spaces imposes ""physical and psychological harm.""  The lawsuit alleges that the measures violate Sections 2 (right of association), 7 (life, liberty and security of the person), 8 (unlawful search and seizure), 9 (arbitrary detention of enforcement officers) and 15 (equality before and under the law) of the charter.  ""The measures ... are further not in accordance with the tenets of fundamental justice in their overbreadth, nor are they justified under S.1 of the charter in that they are demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society,"" the lawsuit states.  Vaccine Choice Canada describes itself as a watchdog organization whose mandate is ""to empower families to make educated, voluntary, and informed decisions about vaccination,"" but public health authorities have criticized the group for spreading false or misleading information about vaccines and immunization.  Names of plaintiffs redacted for fear of harassment  While copies of the 191-page statement of claim exist online, the names and stories of some of the individual plaintiffs have been redacted on the documents by the plaintiffs themselves. Social media posts from Rocco Galati, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said it was done out of precaution to protect the individuals from harassment.  Here is the statement of claim filed in Ontario Superior Court.<a href=""https://t.co/rULDUrXdQe"">https://t.co/rULDUrXdQe</a><br><br>Some of the plaintiffs' names have been redacted to protect them from harassment. —@roccogalatilaw  CBC News has agreed not to name the individuals, who range from a former professor to working parents, a chiropractor and people living with chronic illnesses or disabilities.  No date has been set for when the case will go to court, and it's unclear whether a judge will allow it to proceed.  The lawsuit is seeking $1 million in general damages and $10 million in punitive damages, plus legal costs.  No statements of defence have been filed in the case.  Legal scholar says lawsuit has claims worth examining  Among the personal stories contained in the statement of claim is that of a 23-year-old Hamilton man with autism who has the emotional capacity of a four-year-old. His guardian claims in the suit that the man doesn't have the capacity to understand pandemic health measures, which have ""totally mentally devastated"" him by depriving him of his routines and his social and emotional network.  Another account is of a Mississauga woman who says she can't wear a mask because it triggers a traumatic memory of having a mask forcibly held over her face during a sexual assault.  Protesters gather outside the Ontario Legislature in Toronto in May to demonstrate against government actions related to the coronavirus pandemic. (Chris Young/The Canadian Press)  The claim states the woman is often faced with a choice when she goes out in public without a mask: risk being embarrassed by disclosing her private history or be denied service at local businesses.  ""I don't think we need to violate people's privacy or have them disclose medical conditions, particularly in the context of a private business,"" said Jacob Shelley, an assistant professor of health law and ethics at Western University in London, Ont., who examined an unredacted copy of the lawsuit provided by CBC News.  ""We need to have a discussion about what does it mean to mandate masks. What does it mean to have everyone wear masks when you're indoors and you can't socially distance, because I think there are going to be legitimate instances where people are going to be unable or unwilling to wear a mask for reasons that really are their own.  ""There's lucid, valid, potential issues that maybe are worth being adjudicated before the court.""  A sign encouraging physical distancing at Union Station in Toronto. The City of Toronto is one of the parties named in the suit. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)  Shelley said given the content of the lawsuit, a public debate over masks risks being overshadowed by other claims that aren't supported by science.  ""The 'pandemic' is false, and the measures phony, designed and implemented for improper and ulterior purposes, at the behest of the WHO, controlled and directed by billionaire, corporate oligarchs,"" the statement of claim says.  ""The plaintiffs state, and the fact is, that the evidence is that far many more people have died as a result of the 'pandemic' measures themselves than purportedly from the 'COVID-19 deaths,' even if one takes the deaths 'caused' by COVID as a given.""  A sign put up by Ottawa public health authorities specifying mask rules and who is exempt from them. The lawsuit alleges that measures such as mandatory mask-wearing are 'extreme, unwarranted and unjustified' and some may even impose 'physical and psychological harm.' (Kate Porter/CBC)  Other lawsuit claims  Other claims made in the lawsuit are unrelated to the coronavirus pandemic.  ""Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology report the development of a novel way to record a patient's vaccination history by using smartphone-readable nano crystals called 'quantum dots,' embedded in the skin using micro-needles. In short, a vaccine chip embedded in the body. This work and research are funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,"" the lawsuit said.  The statement of claim includes a timeline that begins in the year 2000 when Bill Gates steps down as the head of Microsoft to start the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It also states Gates expects a ""'twenty-fold' return on his $10 billion vaccine investment within the next few decades.""  Included in the timeline are references to the Chinese military, 5G networks, international vaccine programs and the Rockefeller Foundation as relevant to the creation and spread of the coronavirus, but the lawsuit isn't clear on how.  Shelley said including such references in the statement of claim without providing supporting scientific evidence could ultimately be what gets the suit dismissed before it goes to trial under Ontario's rules of civil procedure.  Toronto lawyer Rocco Galati, who is representing plaintiffs in the suit, initially agreed to speak to CBC News but then did not respond to follow-up requests for comment. (Trevor Hagan/The Canadian Press)  CBC News reached out multiple times to Galati, who is listed as the spokesperson for the lawsuit in a press release issued by Vaccine Choice Canada. He spoke with a reporter last Wednesday but did not agree to an on-the-record interview.  Galati told CBC News he would be available last Thursday for a recorded interview but did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday or the following Monday.  The CBC has also been named as a defendant in the lawsuit for allegedly propagating misinformation and ""false news"" about the coronavirus crisis.  Vaccine Choice Canada has also issued an intent to sue the CBC over other coverage relating to the anti-vaccination and anti-mask movements.",true/false
73,"An American who founded an animal rescue clinic in Kabul is still in Afghanistan, trying to persuade the Taliban to let her retrieve animals released by the U.S. military and airlift them out of the country with the clinic's employees.  Charlotte Maxwell-Jones was unable to board a military evacuation flight with the animals or charter a private aircraft before international troops left earlier this week.  The U.S. military released the clinic's animals from their cages in an enclosed area at the Kabul airport that had previously been used by the former Afghan army, Maxwell-Jones and a Pentagon statement said.  Maxwell-Jones founded Kabul Small Animal Rescue in 2018 to rescue strays, provide veterinary services and help ship animals abroad for adoption. American service members who befriended animals during their deployments and wanted to bring them home have been among her most steady clientele.  The Tennessee native has vowed to stay until she secures the evacuation of her staff, their family members and up to 250 cats and dogs. Maxwell-Jones said she has had eight charter planes canceled in recent days, costing her a substantial amount of money in nonrefundable deposits.  The entire group arrived at the airport together last week, but Taliban guards initially allowed only Maxwell-Jones and the dogs to enter. The employees were told to wait with the cats, she said.  In the end, only nine of the over 125 people associated with the clinic made it through the gates and left Afghanistan, she said. The cats returned to the clinic with staff members.  “Despite an ongoing complicated and retrograde mission, U.S. forces went to great lengths to assist the Kabul Small Animal Rescue as much as possible,” Army Lt. Col. Karen Roxberry, a spokeswoman for U.S. Central Command said in a statement Tuesday.  But Maxwell-Jones said the military provided a lot of “unnecessary pushback” once she was inside the airport.  “All the service members on the ground were very nice,” she said. “They helped take care of the animals; they took them out; they cuddled them. They were really, really great.  “But some of the higher-ups were like: ‘You’re using our resources. We need to get people out. Do you care about animals more than people?’ I didn’t ask to move animals instead of people. I said let’s move them in addition.”  The animals likely would have ridden in cargo spaces, she said.  Photos of some 125 dogs in carrier cages that Maxwell-Jones has been trying to ship out of Afghanistan have been circulating on social media along with accusations that American forces left their working dogs behind when they completed their withdrawal this week.  Pentagon spokesman John Kirby denied the accusations Tuesday, tweeting that the military left none of its dogs and that those photographed belonged to Kabul Small Animal Rescue.  The fate of the animals, about 50 of which Maxwell-Jones described as working dogs left in her care by contractors who supported the U.S. mission, remains unknown.  “There’s a decent chance that most of them are alive,” she said Tuesday in a phone interview, adding that she intends to work with the Taliban, who now control the airport, to retrieve the animals.  She remains hopeful of getting both animals and staffers out of Afghanistan in the coming weeks.  And while the employees wait to depart, they will continue to work, with an extra emphasis on rescuing more contractor working dogs that are believed to have been left behind, Maxwell-Jones said.",true/false
74,"Global warming could be far worse than predicted, new study suggests  Show Caption Hide Caption US temperatures rise over last three decades Temperatures across the United States are up 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 30 years. In Salida, Colorado, residents have noticed the change through more lawn watering, increased air conditioning sales and bigger fires. (June 18) AP  Collapsing polar ice caps, a green Sahara Desert, a 20-foot sea-level rise.  That's the potential future of Earth, a new study suggests, noting that global warming could be twice as warm as current climate models predict.  The rate of warming is also remarkable: “The changes we see today are much faster than anything encountered in Earth’s history. In terms of rate of change, we are in uncharted waters,” said study co-author Katrin Meissner of the University of New South Wales in Australia.  This could mean the landmark Paris Climate Agreement – which seeks to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels – may not be enough to ward off catastrophe.  “Even with just 2 degrees of warming – and potentially just 1.5 degrees – significant impacts on the Earth system are profound,” said study co-author Alan Mix, a scientist from Oregon State University.  “We can expect that sea-level rise could become unstoppable for millennia, impacting much of the world’s population, infrastructure and economic activity,” Mix said.  In looking at Earth's past, scientists can predict what the future will look like. In the study, the researchers looked back at natural global warming periods over the past 3.5 million years and compared them to current man-made warming.  By combining a wide range of measurements from ice cores, sediment layers, fossil records, dating using atomic isotopes and many other established paleoclimate methods, the researchers pieced together the impact of those climatic changes.  Human-inflicted climate change is caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, which release heat-trapping greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into the the atmosphere.  Study lead author Hubertus Fischer of the University of Bern in Switzerland and his team found that our current climate predictions may underestimate long-term warming by as much as a factor of two.  Meissner said that ""climate models appear to be trustworthy for small changes, such as for low-emission scenarios over short periods, say over the next few decades out to 2100. But as the change gets larger or more persistent ... it appears they underestimate climate change.""  The research also revealed how large areas of the polar ice caps could collapse and significant changes to ecosystems could see the Sahara Desert become green and the edges of tropical forests turn into fire-dominated savanna.  However, Meissner said ""we cannot comment on how far in the future these changes will occur.""  Referring to the study findings, lead author Fischer said that without serious reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, there is ""very little margin for error to meet the Paris targets.”  The study, which was conducted by dozens of researchers from 17 countries, was published last week in Nature Geoscience, a peer-reviewed British journal.",true/false
75,"The Delta Covid-19 variant is currently rampant in the United Kingdom according to official data which has been released by Public Health England (PHE) in an attempt to justify the continuation of draconian restrictions on the lives of the British people.  However, we wonder if they realise that the very same data PHE released shows us that people who have received two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine have an 885% higher chance of dying of Covid-19 than of those who are unvaccinated?  The PHE report which can be viewed here shows that between the 1st February 2021 and the 21st June 2021 a total of 92,029 confirmed cases of the Delta variant had been confirmed.  Of these 58.4% were people who had not been vaccinated, totalling 53,822.  A further 7.8% were people who had received both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, totalling 7,235.  A further 14.9% were people who had received one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine at least three weeks prior to testing positive for the Delta Covid variant, totalling 13,715.  And a further 6.78% were people who had received one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine less than three weeks prior to testing positive for the Delta Covid variant, totalling 6,242.  As per the above table taken from the Public Health England report we can see that the number of positive cases of the Delta variant in people who are unvaccinated outnumber the number of positive cases of the Delta variant in people who are fully vaccinated by around 7.4 to 1.  This difference probably gives you the impression that the Covid-19 jabs are working fantastically? Well don’t get too excited.  Because if we take the number of people who have had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine – 27,192, we can see that the number of people who are unvaccinated, who have tested positive for the Delta variant only outnumber people who have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine by around 1.97 to 1.  They don’t seem so fantastic now do they?  But how do have these alleged confirmed cases of the alleged Delta Covid-19 variant translated into hospitalisations? Well thankfully Public Health England tell us within their report.  As per the above table we can see that of the 53,822 confirmed cases of the Delta Covid variant in people who were unvaccinated, 831 presented to emergency care which resulted in overnight inpatient admission. This accounts for 1.54% of the confirmed cases in people who are unvaccinated.  However, of the 7,235 confirmed cases of the Delta variant in people who are fully vaccinated people, 190 presented to emergency care which resulted in overnight inpatient admission. This accounts for 2.6% of the confirmed cases in people who are fully vaccinated.  This data, which has been published by Public Health England, shows us that people who have received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have a 70.1% higher chance of being hospitalised with the alleged Delta Covid variant than people who are unvaccinated.  None of the Covid-19 vaccines have been proven to prevent infection or prevent the spread of the alleged Covid-19 virus. Instead they have allegedly been proven to reduce the risk of hospitalisation and death, but even then the study carried out is highly questionable.  It doesn’t look like the Covid-19 vaccines are doing what they say on the tin, does it? Perhaps they’re doing their job at reducing the risk of death, thankfully Public Health England have provided the data for us to find out.  As per the above table we can see that of the 53,822 confirmed cases of the Delta Covid variant in people who are unvaccinated, 44 have sadly died. This accounts to 0.07% of confirmed cases in the people who are unvaccinated.  However, of the 7,235 confirmed cases of the Delta Covid variant in people who had received both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine and were therefore fully vaccinated, 50 have sadly died. This accounts to 0.69% of confirmed cases in people who are fully vaccinated.  This data, which again has been published by Public Health England, shows us that people who have received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have a 885.7% higher chance of dying due to the Delta Covid variant than people who are unvaccinated.  Now that definitely isn’t what the Covid-19 vaccines said they would do on the tin.  Is this evidence of antibody-dependent enhancement? One senior researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory – Stephanie Seneff, seems to think so.  ADE blighted previous attempts at coronavirus vaccines and frequently resulted in enhanced lung disease among vaccinated lab animals. It led researchers in 2012 to advise scientists to proceed with “caution” for any human coronavirus vaccines which could lead to enhanced lung disease.  Seneff said research has shown that coronavirus vaccines alter the ways immune systems respond to infection and can activate other sleeping infections in the vaccinated person.  “It is conceivable to me that the laser-beam specificity of the induced antibodies is offset by a general weakening of innate immunity,” Seneff said.  “I also suspect that massive vaccination campaigns may accelerate the rate at which the vaccine-resistant mutant strains become dominant among all the SARS-CoV-2 strains.”  Considering the fact 45 million people have had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine in the United Kingdom at the time of writing, it looks like we’re in for one hell of a winter crisis.",true/false

Two weeks ago, Dr. Jane Ruby claimed on the Stew Peters Show that a Delta Airlines pilot died inflight, shortly after the pilot had received a second dose of the Covid-19 vaccination. The mainstream media, Delta, and the so-called fact-checking agencies quickly dismissed the claim, calling it false and unsubstantiated—mainly because the claimant did not supply the name of the pilot, the flight number, or the points of origin and destination for the flight.  Nonetheless, Real Raw News felt the issue deserved further investigation. Although we cannot authenticate Dr. Ruby’s specific incident, we learned that at least two freshly vaccinated pilots had dropped dead midflight within weeks of having received a Covid-19 vaccination.  An FAA whistleblower speaking under condition of anonymity told RRN that the Biden administration, the FAA, and the airlines are covering up the incidents because the airlines need ticket sales and because the administration wants to maintain the illusion that Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective.  According to him, two American Airline pilots in 14 days have perished in the cockpit.  On October 15, American Airlines Flight 2740, an Airbus A320, was enroute from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport to Fort Meyers (RSW) when the unthinkable happened. As the plane began a gradual decent toward southwest Florida, the pilot in command (PIC) began convulsing and had a cardiac arrest. Fortunately, the aircraft was still on autopilot, giving the co-pilot time to evaluate the situation, unharness himself, pull the PIC from his seat and try to administer CPR. But his efforts were in vain.  The co-pilot returned to his seat and squawked 7700, the international transponder code for “I have an emergency.” The plane landed safely, but the co-pilot was put on administrative leave for having left his seat and endangering the aircraft, our source said.  “It was later determined that the PIC had a fatal heart attack caused by myocarditis, a known side effect of the Covid-19 vaccinations. He had received his second dose of the vaccine two weeks before that flight. His last full physical was three months prior, and his doctor had given him a clean bill of health,” our source said.  The second fatality took place a week later, and it, too was a DFW departure. American Airlines Flight 971, an Airbus A321, departed DFW for LAX at 8:00 a.m. Midway through the flight, the co-pilot complained he had chest pains but chalked it up to having eaten a spicy meal before departure. He told the PIC it was indigestion. As the plane flew at 32,000 ft. over the New Mexico/Arizona state line, the co-pilot started convulsing and vomiting on the flight controls. At that point, the PIC contacted Air Traffic Control, requesting permission to swing around and make an emergency landing in Albuquerque, NM, but ATC, after apparently consulting American Airlines, denied the request and compelled the PIC to complete the flight to LAX.  The co-pilot died in his chair, also from acute myocarditis. He had gotten his second vaccination—Pfizer—21 days ahead of that fateful flight.  “The PIC was put under a gag order and told not to discuss the incident with anyone under threat of losing his job,” our source said. “There is a systematic effort going on right now to prevent the public from knowing about pilots getting very ill or very dead in the air. The airlines don’t want to lose money, and the administration doesn’t want the public to know the true dangers of the vaccine. I know for fact that Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg ordered the airlines to classify incidents involving pilot deaths.”  In closing, he added that he is aware of at least 12 non-fatal incidents involving pilots that had recently taken the jab.

77,"Update: Trump Charges Podesta, Abedin with Treason and Crimes Against Children  Former Clinton Staffers Huma Abedin and John Podesta will soon have a new home at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, where they, like Clinton, will face a military tribunal to answer for heinous crimes committed against America and its people.  A confidential source familiar with Trump’s plan to drain the swamp and restore American prosperity to the people told RRN that U.S. Special Forces operating on Trump’s authority conducted simultaneous “nab and grab” missions to apprehend Clinton’s co-conspirators. Trump picked Easter Sunday to arrest the traitors because he believed it to be the best day to catch them unaware and at home, our source added.  Trump’s tactical expertise paid dividends.  At approximately 2:00 p.m., a Special Forces detachment out of Fort Bragg captured Abedin at her parents’ home near Lansing, Michigan, where the family had gathered for Easter dinner. Although Abedin is a radical Islamic Jihadist with obvious ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, she spent her political years pretending to be a Christian.  “Trump learned Abedin would be at her parents’ house for Easter. As you know, Clinton is already at GITMO awaiting trial. She’s given up a lot of info, including on Abedin—she’s allegedly revealed that she and Abedin partook in Adrenochrome infusions from Haitian children. When Navy Seals captured Clinton, they found evidence of this on her laptops, and now her own words have incriminated her and her criminal conspirators,” our source said.  As Huma Abedin was arrested and escorted to a clandestine holding facility in south Florida, a simultaneous offensive was made against John Podesta at his springtime home in the outskirts of Bethesda, MD. Special Forces Operators of the 3rd Special Forces Group descended on his Friendship Village home and used non-lethal force to subdue two bodyguards protecting Podesta and his wife, Mary.  A preliminary report said that U.S. forces suffered no casualties.  Moreover, it’s understood that Donald J. Trump had cleared the operation with General Gen. Richard D. Clarke, Commander of U.S. Special Operations Command.  This is a developing story. More details as they arrive.  (Visited 178,014 times, 8 visits today)",true/false
78,"Researchers in central China study coronavirus samples as some wonder whether the disease escaped from a Wuhan laboratory.  Researchers in central China study coronavirus samples as some wonder whether the disease escaped from a Wuhan laboratory. AFP via Getty Images  At an emergency meeting in Beijing held last Friday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke about the need to contain the coronavirus and set up a system to prevent similar epidemics in the future.  A national system to control biosecurity risks must be put in place “to protect the people’s health,” Xi said, because lab safety is a “national security” issue.  Xi didn’t actually admit that the coronavirus now devastating large swathes of China had escaped from one of the country’s bioresearch labs. But the very next day, evidence emerged suggesting that this is exactly what happened, as the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology released a new directive entitled: “Instructions on strengthening biosecurity management in microbiology labs that handle advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus.”  Read that again. It sure sounds like China has a problem keeping dangerous pathogens in test tubes where they belong, doesn’t it? And just how many “microbiology labs” are there in China that handle “advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus”?  It turns out that in all of China there is only one. And this one is located in the Chinese city of Wuhan that just happens to be . . . the epicenter of the epidemic.  That’s right. China’s only Level 4 microbiology lab that is equipped to handle deadly coronaviruses, called the National Biosafety Laboratory, is part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  Enlarge Image A member of a medical staff checks the body temperature of a patient who has displayed mild symptoms of the coronavirus. AFP via Getty Images  What’s more, the People’s Liberation Army’s top expert in biological warfare, a Maj. Gen. Chen Wei, was dispatched to Wuhan at the end of January to help with the effort to contain the outbreak.  According to the PLA Daily, Gen. Chen has been researching coronaviruses since the SARS outbreak of 2003, as well as Ebola and anthrax. This would not be her first trip to the Wuhan Institute of Virology either, since it is one of only two bioweapons research labs in all of China.  Does that suggest to you that the novel coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, may have escaped from that very lab, and that Gen. Chen’s job is to try and put the genie back in the bottle, as it were? It does to me.  Add to this China’s history of similar incidents. Even the deadly SARS virus has escaped — twice — from the Beijing lab where it was — and probably is — being used in experiments. Both “man-made” epidemics were quickly contained, but neither would have happened at all if proper safety precautions had been taken.  And then there is this little-known fact: Some Chinese researchers are in the habit of selling their laboratory animals to street vendors after they have finished experimenting on them.  You heard me right.  Instead of properly disposing of infected animals by cremation, as the law requires, they sell them on the side to make a little extra cash. Or, in some cases, a lot of extra cash. One Beijing researcher, now in jail, made a million dollars selling his monkeys and rats on the live animal market, where they eventually wound up in someone’s stomach.  Enlarge Image Members of a police sanitation team spray disinfectant as a preventive measure against the spread of the coronavirus. AFP via Getty Images  Also fueling suspicions about SARS-CoV-2’s origins is the series of increasingly lame excuses offered by the Chinese authorities as people began to sicken and die.  They first blamed a seafood market not far from the Institute of Virology, even though the first documented cases of Covid-19 the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 involved people who had never set foot there. Then they pointed to snakes, bats and even a cute little scaly anteater called a pangolin as the source of the virus.  I don’t buy any of this. It turns out that snakes don’t carry coronaviruses and that bats aren’t sold at a seafood market. Neither are pangolins, for that matter, an endangered species valued for their scales as much as for their meat.  The evidence points to SARS-CoV-2 research being carried out at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The virus may have been carried out of the lab by an infected worker or crossed over into humans when they unknowingly dined on a lab animal. Whatever the vector, Beijing authorities are now clearly scrambling to correct the serious problems with the way their labs handle deadly pathogens.  China has unleashed a plague on its own people. It’s too early to say how many in China and other countries will ultimately die for the failures of their country’s state-run microbiology labs, but the human cost will be high.  But not to worry. Xi has assured us that he is controlling biosecurity risks “to protect the people’s health.” PLA bioweapons experts are in charge.  I doubt the Chinese people will find that very reassuring. Neither should we.",true/false

80,"Can any government statistics on COVID-19 deaths be trusted?  It is an open question now that we are learning that the highly respected, world-class Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC has been lying to us.  This revelation comes a few days after I wrote here at American Thinker that New York City was lying about COVID-19 deaths. The normal rules about reporting deaths have been violated by that city in the rush to inflate the body count, presumably to steer more taxpayer money to the Big Apple.  That the CDC isn’t telling the truth to Americans is no conspiracy theory: it’s right out there in the open for everyone to see. The CDC openly admits that it is fudging the COVID-19 death figures.  We know this because, among other truth-tellers, a plainspoken small-town physician from Kalispell, Montana, has pulled back the curtain.  Dr. Annie Bukacek, MD, explained in a presentation how death certificates are made. See “Montana physician Dr. Annie Bukacek discusses how COVID-19 death certificates are being manipulated,” YouTube, April 6  Why should anyone care how a certificate of death is made?  Everyone should care “today when governments are making massive changes that affect our constitutional rights and those changes are based on inaccurate statistics,” Bukacek says.  The system is deeply flawed, she argues.  Few people know how much individual power and leeway is given to the physician, coroner, or medical examiner, signing the death certificate. How do I know this? I've been filling out death certificates for over 30 years. More often than we want to admit, we don’t know with certainty the cause of death when we fill out death certificates. That is just life. We are doctors, not God. Autopsies are rarely performed and even when an autopsy is done the actual cause of death is not always clear. Physicians make their best guesstimate and fill out the form. Then that listed cause of death … is entered into a vital records data bank to use for statistical analysis, which then gives out inaccurate numbers, as you can imagine. Those inaccurate numbers then become accepted as factual information even though much of it is false.  This has been the way it has been done for some time, Bukacek says.  So even before we heard of COVID-19, death certificates were based on assumptions and educated guesses that go unquestioned. When it comes to COVID-19 there is the additional data skewer, that is –get this— there is no universal definition of COVID-19 death. The Centers for Disease Control, updated from yesterday, April 4th, still states that mortality, quote unquote, data includes both confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COVID-19. That’s from their website. Translation? The CDC counts both true COVID-19 cases and speculative guesses of COVID-19 the same. They call it death by COVID-19. They automatically overestimate the real death numbers, by their own admission. Prior to COVID-19, people were more likely to get an accurate cause of death written on their death certificate if they died in the hospital. Why more accurate when a patient dies in the hospital? Because hospital staff has physical examination findings labs, radiologic studies, et cetera, to make a good educated guess. It is estimated that 60 percent of people die in the hospital. But even [with] those in-hospital deaths, the cause of death is not always clear, especially in someone with multiple health conditions, each of which could cause the death.  Bukacek refers to a March 24 CDC memo from Steven Schwartz, director of the Division of Vital Statistics for the National Center for Health Statistics, titled “COVID-19 Alert No. 2.”  “The assumption of COVID-19 death,” she says, “can be made even without testing. Based on assumption alone the death can be reported to the public as another COVID-19 casualty.”  There is a question-and-answer section on the memo.  One question is, “Will COVID-19 be the underlying cause?”  The answer is: “The underlying cause depends upon what and where conditions are reported on the death certificate. However, the rules for coding and selection of the underlying cause of death are expected to result in COVID-19 being the underlying cause more often than not.”  Another question is, “Should ‘COVID-19’ be reported on the death certificate only with a confirmed test?”  The answer is:  “COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or is assumed to have caused or contributed to death.” [Boldfacing in original]  “You could see how these statistics have been made to look really scary when it is so easy to add false numbers to the official database,” Bukacek says. “Those false numbers are sanctioned by the CDC.”  “The real number of COVID-19 deaths are not what most people are told and what they then think,” she says.  “How many people have actually died from COVID-19 is anyone’s guess … but based on how death certificates are being filled out, you can be certain the number is substantially lower than what we are being told. Based on inaccurate, incomplete data people are being terrorized by fearmongers into relinquishing cherished freedoms.”  It’s hard to argue with what Dr. Bukacek says, but no doubt angry social media mobs will find a way as her chilling words enlighten the populace that has been bullied into submission.  Of course, the disease’s body count is not the sole concern we should have about the Chinese contagion, but it is undeniably the primary driver of the rampant mass hysteria that has allowed state and local governments across America to crush our cherished civil liberties.  As they say in newsrooms: if it bleeds, it leads. Deaths are always going to be more “sexy” than confirmed cases. It is the number that really, really counts, and Americans know this.  The fraudulent death statistics also give ammunition to the legions of snitches and scolds who try to shame their fellow Americans for attending church or playing catch in an empty park or taking a harmless drive in the countryside to prevent themselves from going stir-crazy.  The fake death data from the CDC, coupled with wild guesstimates from experts, and the relentless barrage of fear porn the mainstream media subjects Americans to around the clock, have been getting results, even with a plague that is, so far at least, underperforming.  First, experts told us 2.2 million Americans would die. Then the number fell off a cliff, plunging down to around 200,000.  As of April 8, the number of those expected to die from the disease by August 4 was down to 60,000, or roughly a very nasty flu season. The new figure comes from the influential model produced by the University of Washington that the White House regularly cites.  Has social-distancing, wearing face masks, hosing down packages with bleach, using hand sanitizer that is at least 60 percent alcohol, and washing hands with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds helped bring the grim worst-case-scenario body count down?  Probably, I’m guessing, but it’s hard to know for sure.  Maybe those epidemiological modelers can be forgiven for scaring the bejeezus out of Americans. Epidemiology is not, after all, an exact science, as its practitioners sometimes acknowledge.  But those who have force-fed modelers skewed data that led to the terrifying death forecasts that stampeded governors into pushing the nation down the road to totalitarianism need to be held to account.

Some of these perks include access to the White House, free food and drink, free medical care, and $20,000 a month for life. Unfortunately for her, it looks like her free ride is coming to an abrupt end, thanks to President Trump.  President Trump issued an executive order today, nullifying Clinton’s status as a former First Lady, thus removing all of the perks that come with it.  President Trump gave these remarks to the media about the order:  “Hillary Clinton is the worst person in America. She talks very bad about me. She says nasty things. She’s like Obama. Yeah, that Obama is real bad. He says horrible things about me. I would never do that. Why should Hillary get access to the White House and all these perks? She’s a traitor as far as I’m concerned and many people agree with me, many people okay. She’s part of the deep state and a traitor, take her away!”  Republican Joe Barron praised the executive order:  “This is great news! Donald Trump knows what’s best for our country, and if he says Hillary needs to lose her perks, then she needs to lose them. I would never question our President. That’s what they would do in a democracy, and we are a republic, which means we have a King. His name is Donald Trump.”  Rumor has it that Clinton will be selling more uranium to Iran in order to make up for the lost income resulting from Trump’s order. This will open her up to more federal charges, and maybe she will be taken down once and for all. As always Trump is playing 4D chess against her.  Hillary Clinton is a traitor and we are glad to see some fictitious revenge taken against her. This time it will actually be her downfall. We promise.",true/false

84,"The military commission empowered to decide the fate of George W. Bush found the former president guilty of treason and murder, and decreed on Thursday that he be hanged by the neck until dead.  The 3-officer panel tasked with weighing the military’s evidence against Bush reached a decision after hearing days of heated testimony.  On Thursday Bush returned to Guantanamo Bay’s south courtroom without the benefit of having his lawyer present, the latter having been ejected from the proceedings on Wednesday for refusing to curb his theatrical, emotional outbursts. Aufhauser had vowed to file an appeal in response to his ejection, but it’s uncertain to whom he would take such action.  Two more witnesses—both appearing on ZOOM–on Thursday morning testified that George W. Bush had warned them to at all costs avoid New York City, and particularly lower Manhattan, on September 11, and with Bush’s message came a warning: Keep it confidential, or else.  Rick Osborne, a longtime friend of the Bush family and former investigator for the Texas Rangers Division, told the panel he and his family had been planning to vacation in New York the week of September 10, but cancelled on September 8 after receiving an ominous telephone call from the defendant.  “He told me his intelligence people got credible intel that a terrorist attack might go down in New York that week, and he urged me to postpone my trip. I pressed him for mor info—it’s what investigators do—but he wasn’t saying much more. Just told me in damn clear terms to keep my mouth shut about his caution as it was a matter of national security,” Osborne told the panel.  “And as a member of law enforcement you didn’t feel it necessary to investigate further, or tell anyone?” Rear Adm. Crandall pressed him.  “Who the heck was I going to tell? He was George W. Bush, the president. In retrospect I wish I had, but I can’t go back in time,” Osborne said.  The next to testify was none other than James Baker, who served as White House Chief of Staff and United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Ronald Reagan, and as U.S. Secretary of State and White House Chief of Staff under President George H. W. Bush. The 91-year-old statesman had a physician at his side and a nasal cannula in his nostrils. He struggled to speak, and between gasping breaths said that he, too, had been told by the defendant to avoid New York and D.C. the week of September 10.  “I had a public speaking engagement scheduled in New York and Washington for that week,” Baker sputtered. “It was either two or three days before 9/11—I can’t remember what day—double-yew phoned me, telling me to stay home that week because something big was about to happen. I wanted more information, but he beat around the bush, no pun intended, and got silent. Told me, though, that both he and his father needed me to keep it a secret. I’ve known them all my life, but I knew better than to cross them. Lots of empty space in West Texas, if you catch my meaning.”  “Why are you coming forward now?” Rear Adm. Crandall asked.  “I don’t have much time left, and if there’s even a slim chance I don’t end up in hell, I’ll take it,” Baker replied.  Rear Adm. Crandall asserted that witness testimony, in combination with the Rumsfeld tapes, proved conclusively that George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and Donald Rumsfeld were the architects of 9/11.  Although he had more “proof” to offer into evidence, the panel said it had heard enough to not only find Bush guilty but also recommend he hang for crimes against America. The 3-officers found him guilty of treason and held him to account for every life lost on 9/11.  Rear Adm. Crandall affirmed the verdict, and he set George W. Bush’s date of execution for Tuesday, January 4.  (Note: Gavin Newsom’s tribunal was delayed and is now slated to begin December 27)  RRN is an independent publisher that relies on reader support.

Work crews showed up and made quick work, rolling the monument out and down the ramp for disabled people.  Pelosi had this to say about the removal:  “It’s long overdue that we make a separation between church and state. Non-Christians should not be forced to read the 10 commandments while walking into their capitol. God doesn’t belong here.”  God doesn’t belong here? Those are fighting words.

And, if a woman interferes in a fight between two men by grabbing her husband’s opponent’s privates, her hand should be cut off.  We need to get back to these biblical basics.

Code-named “Vault 7” by WikiLeaks, it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency.  The first full part of the series, “Year Zero”, comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA’s Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election.  Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized “zero day” exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.  “Year Zero” introduces the scope and direction of the CIA’s global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of “zero day” weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple’s iPhone, Google’s Android and Microsoft’s Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones.  Since 2001 the CIA has gained political and budgetary preeminence over the U.S. National Security Agency NSA. The CIA found itself building not just its now infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert, globe-spanning force — its own substantial fleet of hackers. The agency’s hacking division freed it from having to disclose its often controversial operations to the NSA its primary bureaucratic rival in order to draw on the NSA’s hacking capacities.  By the end of 2016, the CIA’s hacking division, which formally falls under the agency’s Center for Cyber Intelligence CCI, had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other “weaponized” malware. Such is the scale of the CIA’s undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook. The CIA had created, in effect, its “own NSA” with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified.  In a statement to WikiLeaks the source details policy questions that they say urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the CIA’s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency. The source wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons.  Once a single cyber ‘weapon’ is ‘loose’ it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by rival states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike.  Julian Assange, WikiLeaks editor stated that “There is an extreme proliferation risk in the development of cyber ‘weapons’. Comparisons can be drawn between the uncontrolled proliferation of such ‘weapons’, which results from the inability to contain them combined with their high market value, and the global arms trade. But the significance of “Year Zero” goes well beyond the choice between cyberwar and cyberpeace. The disclosure is also exceptional from a political, legal and forensic perspective.”  Wikileaks has carefully reviewed the “Year Zero” disclosure and published substantive CIA documentation while avoiding the distribution of ‘armed’ cyberweapons until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA’s program and how such ‘weapons’ should analyzed, disarmed and published.  Wikileaks has also decided to redact and anonymise some identifying information in “Year Zero” for in depth analysis. These redactions include ten of thousands of CIA targets and attack machines throughout Latin America, Europe and the United States. While we are aware of the imperfect results of any approach chosen, we remain committed to our publishing model and note that the quantity of published pages in “Vault 7” part one “Year Zero” already eclipses the total number of pages published over the first three years of the Edward Snowden NSA leaks.",true/false

88,"Tony Abbott: Daring To Doubt 2017 Annual GWPF Lecture The Honourable Tony Abbott MP Former Prime Minister of Australia ‘Daring To Doubt’ London, 9 October 2017 Thank you for giving me the same platform that you’ve previously given to fellow Australians John Howard and George Pell. I will strive to be worthy of their example and their friendship; to offer a common sense way through the climate conflict; and, also, to place this particular issue in the broader struggle for practical wisdom now taking place across the Western world. It would be wrong to underestimate the strengths of the contemporary West. By objective standards, people have never had better lives. Yet our phenomenal wealth and our scientific and technological achievements rest on values and principles that have rarely been more widely challenged. To a greater or lesser extent, in most Western countries, we can’t keep our borders secure; we can’t keep our industries intact; and we can’t preserve a moral order once taken for granted. Eventually, something will crystalize out of this age of disruption but in the meantime we could be entering a period of national and even civilizational decline. In Australia, we’ve had ten years of disappointing government. It’s not just the churn of prime ministers that now rivals Italy’s, the internal divisions and the policy confusion that followed a quarter century of strong government under Bob Hawke and John Howard. It’s the institutional malaise. We have the world’s most powerful upper house: a Senate where good government can almost never secure a majority. Our businesses campaign for same sex marriage but not for economic reform. Our biggest company, BHP, the world’s premier miner, lives off the coal industry that it now wants to disown. And our oldest university, Sydney, now boasts that its mission is “unlearning”. Of course, to be an Australian is still to have won the lottery of life, and there’s yet no better place to live and work. But there’s a nagging sense that we’re letting ourselves down and failing to reach anything like our full potential. We are not alone in this. The Trump ascendancy, however it works out, was a popular revolt against politics-as-usual. Brexit was a rejection of the British as well as of the European establishments. Yes, the centrist, Macron, won in France but only by sidelining the parties that had ruled from the start of the Fifth Republic. And while the German chancellor was re-elected, seemingly it’s at the head of an unstable coalition after losing a quarter of her vote. Everywhere, there’s a breakdown of public trust between voters and their leaders for misdiagnosing problems, for making excuses about who’s to blame, and for denying the damage that’s been done. Since the Global Financial Crisis, at least in the West, growth has been slow, wages stagnant, opportunities limited, and economic and cultural disruption unprecedented. Within countries and between them, old pecking orders are changing. Civilizational self-doubt is everywhere; we believe in everyone but ourselves; and everything is taken seriously except that which used to be. Just a few years ago, history was supposed to have ended in the triumph of the Western liberal order. Yet far from becoming universal, Western values are less and less accepted even in the West itself. We still more or less accept that every human being is born with innate dignity; with rights, certainly, but we’re less sure about the corresponding duties. We still accept the golden rule of human conduct: to treat others as we would have them treat us – or to use the Gospel formula to “love your neighbour as you love yourself” – but we’re running on empty. In Britain and Australia, scarcely 50 per cent describe themselves as Christian, down from 90 per cent a generation back. For decades, we’ve been losing our religious faith but we’re fast losing our religious knowledge too. We’re less a post-Christian society than a non-Christian, or even an anti-Christian one. It hasn’t left us less susceptible to dogma, though, because we still need things to believe in and causes to fight for; it’s just that believers can now be found for almost anything and everything. Climate change is by no means the sole or even the most significant symptom of the changing interests and values of the West. Still, only societies with high levels of cultural amnesia – that have forgotten the scriptures about man created “in the image and likeness of God” and charged with “subduing the earth and all its creatures” – could have made such a religion out of it. There’s no certain way to regain cultural self-confidence. The heart of any recovery, though, has to be an honest facing of facts and an insistence upon intellectual rigour. More than ever, the challenge of leadership is to say what you mean and do what you say. The lesson I’ve taken from being in government, and then out of it, is simply to speak my mind. The risk, when people know where you stand, is losing their support. The certainty, when people don’t know where you stand, is losing their respect. Of course, we’re all nostalgic for the days when governments and oppositions could agree on the big issues; but pleading for bi-partisanship won’t create it. As my government showed on border protection policy, the only way to create a new consensus is to argue the case, to make a decision, and then to let the subsequent facts speak for themselves. The modern world, after all, is not the product of a successful search for consensus. It’s what’s emerged from centuries of critical enquiry and hard clash. Without the constant curiosity and endless questioning that has driven our scientists and engineers, and the constant striving for improvement that’s long guided our planners and policy makers, there’d be no cures for disease, no labour-saving appliances, no sanitation, no urban improvement, no votes for women, no respect for minorities; in other words, no modern world. That may not actually bother some green activists whose ideal is an Amish existence, only without reference to God. But it should bother anyone and everyone who wants longer, safer, more comfortable and more prosperous lives. Beware the pronouncement, “the science is settled”. It’s the spirit of the Inquisition, the thought-police down the ages. Almost as bad is the claim that “99 per cent of scientists believe” as if scientific truth is determined by votes rather than facts. There are laws of physics; there are objective facts; there are moral and ethical truths. But there is almost nothing important where no further enquiry is needed. What the “science is settled” brigade want is to close down investigation by equating questioning with superstition. It’s an aspect of the wider weakening of the Western mind which poses such dangers to the world’s future. Physics suggests, all other things being equal, that an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide would indeed warm the planet. Even so, the atmosphere is an almost infinitely complex mechanism that’s far from fully understood. Palaeontology indicates that over millions of years there have been warmer periods and cooler periods that don’t correlate with carbon dioxide concentrations. The Jurassic warm period and the ice ages occurred without any human contribution at all. The medieval warm period when crops were grown in Greenland and the mini-ice age when the Thames froze over occurred well before industrial activities added to atmospheric carbon dioxide. Prudence and respect for the planet would suggest taking care not lightly to increase carbon dioxide emissions; but the evidence suggests that other factors such as sun spot cycles and oscillations in the Earth’s orbit are at least as important for climate change as this trace gas – which, far from being pollution, is actually essential for life to exist. Certainly, no big change has accompanied the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration over the past century from roughly 300 to roughly 400 parts per million or from 0.03 to 0.04 per cent. Contrary to the breathless assertions that climate change is behind every weather event, in Australia, the floods are not bigger, the bushfires are not worse, the droughts are not deeper or longer, and the cyclones are not more severe than they were in the 1800s. Sometimes, they do more damage but that’s because there’s more to destroy, not because their intensity has increased. More than 100 years of photography at Manly Beach in my electorate does not suggest that sea levels have risen despite frequent reports from climate alarmists that this is imminent. It may be that a tipping point will be reached soon and that the world might start to warm rapidly but so far reality has stubbornly refused to conform to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s computer modelling. Even the high-priests of climate change now seem to concede that there was a pause in warming between the 1990s and 2014. So far, though, there’s no concession that their models might require revision even though unadjusted data suggests that the 1930s were actually the warmest decade in the United States and that temperatures in Australia have only increased by 0.3 degrees over the past century, not the 1 degree usually claimed. The growing evidence that records have been adjusted, that the impact of urban heat islands has been downplayed, and that data sets have been slanted in order to fit the theory of dangerous anthropogenic global warming does not make it false; but it should produce much caution about basing drastic action upon it. Then there’s the evidence that higher concentrations of carbon dioxide (which is a plant food after all) are actually greening the planet and helping to lift agricultural yields. In most countries, far more people die in cold snaps than in heat waves, so a gradual lift in global temperatures, especially if it’s accompanied by more prosperity and more capacity to adapt to change, might even be beneficial. In what might be described as Ridley’s paradox, after the distinguished British commentator: at least so far, it’s climate change policy that’s doing harm; climate change itself is probably doing good; or at least, more good than harm. Australia, for instance, has the world’s largest readily available supplies of coal, gas and uranium, yet thanks to a decade of policy based more on green ideology than common sense, we can’t be sure of keeping the lights on this summer; and, in the policy-induced shift from having the world’s lowest power prices to amongst the highest, our manufacturing industry has lost its one, big comparative economic advantage. About 20 years ago, in Australia, limiting carbon dioxide emissions first became a goal of public policy. It was the Howard government, back in 1997, that originally introduced the Renewable Energy Target, a stealth carbon tax, requiring energy suppliers to source a percentage of their power from new renewable generation. But in those far off days, it was just 2 per cent. During the energy discussions around the Howard cabinet table, I recall thinking “why not encourage more solar hot water systems to reduce power use” and “why not incentivise the installation of solar panels to help power people’s homes”? Way back in the 1980s, in my final provost’s collection at The Queen’s College, Lord Blake had observed: “Mr Abbott needs to temper his robust common sense with a certain philosophic doubt”. If only more of us had realised sooner how easy it was with renewable power to have too much of a good thing! Unsurprisingly, a conservative cabinet did indeed respond to farmers’ worries about the drought then gripping eastern Australia; and the public’s then eagerness to support environmental gestures with other people’s money. We thought we could reduce emissions, or at least limit their increase, without much disruption to everyday life, hence these gestures to the zeitgeist. Where the subsidy was modest and the impact on the power system minimal, our thinking ran, why not accommodate the feel-good urge to be “responsible global citizens”? In its last few months, the Howard government even agreed in-principle to support an emissions trading scheme. But Howard was shrewd enough to know how the most important consequences of any policy were often the unintended ones. His government’s refusal to ratify the Kyoto climate change treaty, even though we’d secured a good deal for Australia, showed his caution about the impact of emissions reduction on power prices and the wider economy. For the incoming Labor Prime Minister after 2007, though, climate change was nothing less than the “greatest moral challenge of our time”. The Rudd-Gillard government believed in an emissions trading scheme, no ifs, no buts, and in a ten-fold increase in the mandatory use of renewables. For a while, the Liberal-National opposition was inclined to go along with it. My own leaning for the first year or so was not to oppose it; but my doubts about the theory of climate change were growing and my sense that an ETS would turn out to be a “great big new tax on everything” was hardening. To a party audience in country Victoria in October 2009, I observed that the so-called settled science of climate change was “absolute crap”; and after winning the opposition leadership had a secret party room ballot to oppose an ETS because it was not our job to enter into weak compromises with a bad government. As it happened, the 2010 election was more about power prices than about saving the planet. Under great political pressure, then Prime Minister Julia Gillard, declared “there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead”. But early in 2011, as part of her minority government’s deal with the Greens, she committed to a carbon tax that would put wholesale power prices up by 40 per cent. The 2013 election was a referendum on Labor’s carbon tax – as well as Labor’s complete loss of control over our maritime borders – with a thumping win to the Liberal-National Coalition. In July 2014, the Abbott government abolished the carbon tax, saving the average household about $500 a year. In early 2015, we reduced the Renewable Energy Target from 28 to 23 per cent. It wasn’t enough, but it was the best that we could get through the Senate. My cabinet always had some ministers focussed on jobs and cost of living; and others more concerned with emissions reduction, even though our contribution to global emissions was barely one per cent. Inevitably, our Paris agreement to a 26 to 28 per cent emissions reduction was a compromise based on the advice that we could achieve it largely through efficiencies, without additional environmental imposts, using the highly successful emissions reduction fund; because, as I said at the time, “the last thing we want to do is strengthen the environment (but) damage our economy”. At last year’s election, the government chose not to campaign on power prices even though Labor was promising a 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target (requiring a $50 billion over-build of wind farms) and a 45 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030 (requiring a new carbon tax). After a net gain of 25 seats at the previous two elections, when we had campaigned on power prices, we had a net loss of 14 when we didn’t. And subsequent events have made the politics of power once more the central battleground between and within the two main parties. Although manufacturing, agriculture and transport are also large carbon dioxide emitters, the politics of emissions reduction has always focussed on power generation because shifting to renewables has always been more saleable to voters than closing down industry, giving up cars and not eating beef. As a badge of environmental virtue, the South Australian state Labor government had been boasting that, on average, almost 50 per cent of its power was wind-generated – although at any moment it could vary from almost zero to almost 100 per cent. It had even ostentatiously blown up its one coal-fired power station. In September last year, though, the wind blew so hard that the turbines had to shut down – and the inter-connector with Victoria and its reliable coal-fired power failed too. For 24 hours, there was a state wide blackout. For nearly two million people, the lights were off, cash registers didn’t work, traffic lights went down, lifts stopped, and patients were sent home from hospitals. Throughout last summer, there were further blackouts and brownouts across eastern Australia requiring hundreds of millions in repairs to the plant of energy-intensive industries. Despite this, in a display of virtue signalling, to flaunt its environmental credentials (and to boost prices for its other coal-fired plants), last March the French-government part-owned multinational, Engie, closed down the giant Hazelwood coal-fired station that had supplied a quarter of Victoria’s power. The Australian Energy Market Operator is now sufficiently alarmed to have just issued an official warning of further blackouts this summer in Victoria and South Australia and severe medium term power shortfalls. But in yet more virtue-signalling, energy giant AGL is still threatening to close the massive Liddell coal-fired power station in NSW and replace it with a subsidised solar farm and a much smaller gas-fired power station relying on gas supplies that don’t currently exist. Were it not rational behaviour based on irrational government policy, this deliberate elimination of an essential service could only be described as a form of economic self-harm. Hydro aside, renewable energy should properly be referred to as intermittent and unreliable power. When the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine, the power doesn’t flow. Wind and solar power are like sailing ships; cheaper than powered boats, to be sure, but we’ve stopped using sail for transport because it couldn’t be trusted to turn up on time. Because the weather is unpredictable, you never really know when renewable power is going to work. Its marginal cost is low but so is its reliability, so in the absence of industrial scale batteries, it always needs matching capacity from dependable coal, gas, hydro, or nuclear energy. This should always have been obvious. Also now apparent is the system instability and the perverse economics that subsidised renewables on a large scale have injected into our power supply. Not only is demand variable but there’s a vast and unpredictable difference between potential and dispatch-able capacity at any one time. Having to turn coal fired power stations up or down as the wind changes makes them much less profitable even though coal remains by far the cheapest source of reliable power. A market that’s driven by subsidies rather than by economics always fails. Subsidy begets subsidy until the system collapses into absurdity. In Australia’s case, having subsidised renewables, allegedly to save the planet; we’re now faced with subsidising coal, just to keep the lights on. We have got ourselves into this mess because successive federal governments have tried to reduce emissions rather than to ensure reliable and affordable power; because, rather than give farmers a fairer return, state governments have given in to green lobbyists and banned or heavily restricted gas exploration and extraction; and because shareholder activists have scared power companies out of new investment in fossil fuel power generation, even though you can’t run a modern economy without it. In the short term, to avoid blackouts, we have to get mothballed or under-utilised gas back into the system. In the medium term, there must be – first – no subsidies, none, for new intermittent power (and a freeze on the RET should be no problem if renewables are as economic as the boosters claim); second, given the nervousness of private investors, there must be a government-built coal-fired power station to overcome political risk; third, the gas bans must go; and fourth, the ban on nuclear power must go too in case a dry country ever needs base load power with zero emissions. The government is now suggesting that there might not be a new Clean Energy Target after all. There must not be – and we still need to deal with what’s yet to come under the existing target. In the longer term, we need less theology and more common sense about emissions reduction. It matters but not more than everything else. As Clive James has suggested in a celebrated recent essay, we need to get back to evidence based policy rather than “policy based evidence”. Even if reducing emissions really is necessary to save the planet, our effort, however Herculean, is barely-better-than-futile; because Australia’s total annual emissions are exceeded by just the annual increase in China’s. There’s a veneer of rational calculation to emissions reduction but underneath it’s about “doing the right thing”. Environmentalism has managed to combine a post-socialist instinct for big government with a post-Christian nostalgia for making sacrifices in a good cause. Primitive people once killed goats to appease the volcano gods. We’re more sophisticated now but are still sacrificing our industries and our living standards to the climate gods to little more effect. So far, climate change policy has generated new taxes, new subsidies and new restrictions in rich countries; and new demands for more aid from poor countries. But for the really big emitters, China and India, it’s a first world problem. Between them, they’re building or planning more than 800 new coal-fired power stations – often using Australian coal – with emissions, on average, 30 per cent lower than from our own ageing generators. Unsurprisingly, the recipients of climate change subsidies and climate change research grants think action is very urgent indeed. As for the general public, of course saving the planet counts – until the bills come in and then the humbug detector is switched on. Should Australia close down its steel industry; watch passively while its aluminium industry moves offshore to places less concerned about emissions; export coal, but not use it ourselves; and deliberately increase power prices for people who can’t install their own solar panels and batteries? Of course not, but these are the inevitable consequences of continuing current policies. That’s the reality no one has wanted to face for a long time: that we couldn’t reduce emissions without also hurting the economy; that’s the inconvenient truth that can now no longer be avoided. The only rational choice is to put Australian jobs and Australia’s standard of living first; to get emissions down but only as far as we can without putting prices up. After two decades’ experience of the very modest reality of climate change but the increasingly dire consequences of the policy to deal with it, anything else would be a dereliction of duty as well as a political death wish. I congratulate the Global Warming Policy Foundation for your commitment to rational inquiry; your insistence that the theory must be made to fit the facts, rather than the other way round; your concern to do good, rather than just to seem good; and for the hope I share with you: that, in the end, the best policy will turn out to be the best politics. I’m reminded of the story of a man randomly throwing pieces of paper from the window of a train. Eventually his companion asked him why he did it. It keeps the elephants down, he said. “But there are no elephants here”, his companion replied. “Precisely; it’s a very successful method”. A tendency to fear catastrophe is ingrained in the human psyche. Looking at the climate record over millions of years, one day it will probably come; whatever we do today won’t stop it, and when it comes, it will have little to do with the carbon dioxide emissions of mankind.",true/false
89,"Henry Kissinger, eminence grise of imperial US foreign policy, has warned in an op-ed that no government – even his beloved hegemon – can defeat Covid-19 alone, implying that the New World Order he’s always preached must follow.  If the US doesn’t couple its efforts to rebuild its own economy with the first steps toward creating a global government, humanity is doomed, Kissinger wrote in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed.  “No country, not even the US, can in a purely national effort overcome the virus,” Kissinger warned. “Addressing the necessities of the moment must ultimately be coupled with a global collaborative vision and program.”  If we cannot do both in tandem, we will face the worst of each.  Kissinger laments that the pandemic has led to the return of a “walled city” model of nationalist governance, suggesting that “exploration at the frontiers of science” alone can save humanity from disease in his vision of a globalist utopia.  But developing cures takes time, and the notion that countries should be discouraged from protecting themselves in the interim is suicidal. If anything, one of the reasons Italy, Spain, and France were hit so hard by coronavirus was the EU’s dysfunctional insistence on open borders amid the pandemic.  “Global trade and movement of people” are all well and good, but the pandemic has exposed the weaknesses of the globalist system like never before. It will take years for nations to rebuild, and repeating their mistakes is not something they can afford to do.  While serving as Secretary of State and National Security Adviser under presidents Nixon and Ford, Kissinger played a starring role in bombing campaigns against Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos and oversaw regime-change operations that placed brutal dictators in power in Argentina and Chile, as well as supporting state-sanctioned repression in Indonesia.  A notorious report he penned for the Ford administration called for dramatic reductions in population growth across developing nations. One might think, given his record, that he’d be on the side of the virus.  But the Nobel Peace Prize recipient is here presenting himself as an experienced statesman who deeply cares about the future of humanity, calling on the US to “draw lessons from the development of the Marshall Plan and the Manhattan Project.”  Sure, revisiting the Marshall Plan makes sense – there are no doubt insights to be gained from revisiting the rebuilding of Europe’s shattered post-war economies, especially since some of the countries hit hardest by the epidemic are in Europe.  But the Manhattan Project? How does a top-secret, international doomsday project that produced weapons with unparalleled killing potential have any bearing on the coronavirus crisis?  Listening to Kissinger, it must be said, is what got the US into its current situation – believing itself exceptional, distrusting all world powers who do not swear abject fealty to it, repeating the same failed policies to the point of parody.  A looming presence in the George W. Bush administration, Kissinger advised the country to plunge headfirst into the ever-expanding War on Terror, penning an editorial in the days following 9/11 that called for taking on “any government that shelters groups capable of this kind of attack.”  Following such guidance has bankrupted the US and turned it into a banana republic, printing money frantically while its roads and bridges crumble, its citizens struggle to keep a roof over their heads, and the international community looks on, mouths agape, as its government continues to lecture them about human rights.  Kissinger concludes his jeremiad with a warning that “failure [to safeguard the principles of the liberal world order] could set the world on fire.”  If, as he himself writes, the “purpose of the legitimate state is to provide for the fundamental needs of the people: security, order, economic well-being, and justice,” those principles collapsed long ago.  The US’ first step, post-pandemic, should be to put out the fires set by Kissinger and those like him who seek to cloak empire in the rhetoric of liberal democracy.

91,"The worst murderers should be given a chance to escape staying in prison for life by pleading guilty, according to new rules drawn up for judges The worst murderers should be given a chance to escape staying in prison for life by pleading guilty, according to new rules drawn up for judges. The say a judge should take a killer's confession to the court into account when deciding whether they should be kept behind bars for good with a whole-life term. The proposal by the Sentencing Council, the body led by judges which instructs judges and magistrates on the punishments they should hand down, allows the possibility of eventual freedom to even the most evil murderers if they admit their guilt at the earliest opportunity. Critics warned yesterday that if the new sentencing rule goes into effect it could act as encouragement to murderers. Criminologist Dr David Green of the Civitas think tank, a former Home Office adviser on crime statistics, said: 'If someone knows they could get a lighter sentence if they own up, that could make them more inclined to kill.' The new murder sentencing rule is contained in a consultation document published by the Council, which lays down guidelines for judges and magistrates which they must follow unless they believe it would be unjust to do so. The paper suggests new guidance for the courts on what leniency should be shown to criminals who plead guilty. Murder sentences have been regarded as different from those imposed for all other crimes ever since the abolition of the death penalty in 1965. Those convicted of murder are always given a life sentence, but the judge also sets a real term of years that the killer will be made to serve in prison before release. The Sentencing Council said last year that 56 murderers were serving whole-life terms, which mean that they will never leave prison. These include Levi Bellfield, killer of Milly Dowler and two other women; alongside other serial murderers Peter Sutcliffe, Ian Brady, Dennis Nilson and Rosemary West. The new proposal, which will now go through a three-month consultation process before the Council decides whether to put it into effect, says that 'a court should consider the fact that an offender has pleaded guilty to murder when deciding whether it is appropriate to order a whole life term.' The paper said this is one of 'some differences' from the existing murder sentencing rules, set down by the Council's predecessor body, the Sentencing Guidelines Council, in 2007. Different guidance on whole life terms for murderers, it said, is included to reflect a 2005 Court of Appeal decision on murder sentencing. Under the new proposal, the paper said, 'the draft guideline explicitly states that the fact that an offender has pleaded guilty may be taken into account in deciding whether it is appropriate to order a whole life term.' It added that 'murder is the most serious criminal offence and the sentence prescribed is different from all other sentences.' The 2005 Appeal Court judgement on murder sentencing and guilty pleas, handed down by then Lord Chief Justice Lord Phillips and two other judges, considered sentences in two murder cases. The Appeal judges said: 'The court should consider the fact that the defendant has pleaded guilty to murder when deciding whether it is appropriate to order a whole life term.' However this decision was not included in the sentencing rules for murder handed down to judges in 2007. A spokesman for the Sentencing Council said: 'The practice in the courts will be unchanged. Judges have to follow the decisions set down by the Court of Appeal.' The Sentencing Council said last year that 56 murderers were serving whole-life terms, which mean that they will never leave prison. These include Levi Bellfield pictured, killer of Milly Dowler and two other women; alongside other serial murderers Peter Sutcliffe, Ian Brady, Dennis Nilson and Rosemary West The Council also said that general criminals who do not plead guilty at the first opportunity should get a lesser cut in their sentence. The bonus for an early guilty plea should remain a third off the sentence, it said, but those who plead guilty later in the court process should get only a fifth off their sentence rather than a quarter. The Sentencing Council chairman, Appeal judge Lord Justice Treacy, said: 'We want those who have committed crimes to admit their guilt as early as possible. When they do, it means victims and witnesses can be reassured that the offender has accepted responsibility for what they have done and that they are spared having to appear at court to testify. 'It also means that the police and Crown Prosecution Service can use their resources more efficiently to investigate and prosecute other cases.' But Dr Green said: 'If a judge is considering a whole life sentence it must be a case of truly evil murder. The sole consideration should be how strong a message of disapproval society wants to send. It should be sending the strongest possible message.",true/false

93,"38 SHARES LinkedIn Email Reddit Telegram Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel has been fired for covering-up the truth about what happened during the Parkland shooting. According to reports, following a criminal investigation by Florida Governor Rick Scott, Sheriff Israel will be replaced as early as next week. BYPASS THE CENSORS Sign up to get unfiltered news delivered straight to your inbox. Email * From Big League Politics: Sheriff Israel is being removed from office for criminal issues, not malfeasance, following an investigation conducted by the office of Florida Governor Rick Scott. The source exclusively revealed to Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is also allegedly being investigated by the IRS. The high-level police source within the Sheriff’s Office disclosed that over the last several months, four candidates have been interviewed to refill the position of Broward County Sheriff. One of the candidates who were interviewed is Emery Giany, a Republican Florida law enforcement official who is closely associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. During the IG’s testimony last week, FBI director Christopher Wray was asked about the Parkland school shooting. When asked, Wray declined to answer any questions about the shooting and Sheriff Israel, citing that it was an active FBI investigation. Following the Parkland shooting, Governor Scott called for Director Wray to resign over the FBI’s failure to properly investigate Nikolas Cruz, 19, the school shooter whose plans to carry out a school shooting were reported to the FBI twice prior to the shooting on Valentine’s Day. “We constantly promote ‘see something, say something,’ and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act. ‘See something, say something’ is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow through from law enforcement. The FBI Director needs to resign,” Governor Scott said. According to the source in the Broward Sheriffs office, Sheriff Israel’s removal revolves around a criminal matter that the FBI is aware of. Although his failures surrounding the Parkland shooting initially sparked the investigation, it isn’t the sole reason why he is being removed. The high-level source who wished to remain anonymous told Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is already aware of the fact that he is being removed from office next week. Sheriff Israel has been under heavy criticism for his handling of the of the Parkland school shooting, which left 17 people dead. Following the Valentine’s Day school massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, it was revealed that police officers under Sheriff Israel’s order were called to the home of the Parkland shooter 45 times prior to the school shooting. It is unclear why law enforcement officials law enforcement at the Broward County Sheriff’s office and FBI failed to properly investigate Cruz, but their massive failure has been directly attributed to the loss of 17 lives in Parkland, FL. Since the Parkland shooting, a lot of unflattering information has come out regarding Sheriff Israel. Along with being a mouthpiece for Democratic politicians and gun control advocates, like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz who he has been photographed with, Sheriff Israel and his department have recently made headlines for more controversy. In May, it was revealed that Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school and the Broward County Sheriff’s office were keeping quiet the fact that Sheriff Israel’s son, Brett, had allegedly assaulted a 14 year old student on campus in an act of bullying. Shortly after the Parkland shooting, cell phone video filmed by Cruz himself revealed that he himself felt bullied, which lead him to carry out a massacre on February 14, 2018 in a targeted attack against his former classmates. Most recently, Sheriff Israel received a massive amount of backlash after the Broward County Sheriff’s office tweeted a picture of a new custom made Broward sheriff’s car that read, “Our new #dodge #charger. Do you like the paint job?” The tweet sparked outrage online from Republicans and Democrats alike who quipped that the Broward Sheriff’s office should use the funds to pay for better officer training, not new cars. Leaders on both sides of the aisle have called for Sheriff Israel to resign or be removed by the Governor for his extreme dereliction of duty and failure to prevent one of the worst schools shootings in US history. During the Florida GOP Primary debate in Florida last week, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam and Rep. Ron DeSantis were asked about the Parkland school shooting. Both Putnam and DeSantis called for the removal of Scott Israel while asserting their support of the Second Amendment. “I would have removed that sheriff from Broward County. He failed his citizens and he should have been removed,” DeSantis said. “Sheriff Israel is under investigation and he needs to go,” Putnam said. Governor Scott is expected to release a statement in the coming week when Sheriff Israel is removed from office. Scott is currently running for US Senate in Florida, and news of Sheriff Israel’s removal is sure to boost his approval rating in what is gearing up to be one of the most important Senate races in the country. In the days following the Parkland shooting, Sheriff Scott Israel was confronted and asked about his support of and affiliation with the Democratic Party and why he chose to blame guns instead of holding his department and the FBI accountable. Unable to withstand tough questioning, Sheriff Israel became flustered and ended the interview after saying, “the only person accountable for this killing is the detestable, cowardly, murderer. He is solely responsible for this horrific act.” However, as the investigation into Parkland has shown, both Sheriff Israel and the FBI dropped the ball and are to blame for their failure to prevent the shooting despite receiving multiple warning signs.",true/false
94,"Editor’s Note: The headline of this article has been altered to more accurately reflect how findings of the study on fermented cabbage in Europe may correlate with kimchi, a fermented cabbage, in South Korea and other Asian countries in helping to lower COVID-19 fatalities.  Low COVID-19 fatality rates in South Korea may be attributed to kimchi, a recent study has found.  The study: A team of researchers in France, led by Pulmonary Medicine at Montpellier University honorary professor Dr. Jean Bousquet, conducted a study on the dietary preferences of countries with low fatalities from the novel coronavirus.       Reported in Clinical and Translational Allergy, a similar study found that countries where diet mainly consists of fermented cabbage had lower reported deaths from the virus.     According to the report, fermented cabbage in dishes helps in reducing levels of ACE2, an enzyme in the lungs that COVID-19 uses to gain access to the bodies of patients.      With a lower amount of ACE2, it becomes more difficult for the virus to enter the body, reported The Sun.  Which countries specifically: In South Korea, where the fermented cabbage dish kimchi is a staple food, 296 people have died out of 13,771 infected with COVID-19, registering a fatality rate of 2.14%.  Read More Advertisement      Meanwhile, Germany’s sauerkraut is also seen as a reason for their low death rate of 4.51% 9,163 deaths out of 202,845 cases as of this writing.  In Italy 14.33%, Spain 9.24% and the United Kingdom 15.36%, and other countries where fermented cabbage is not a regular part of the diet, the death rate is comparatively higher.       Consumption of yogurt or caviar has also helped Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey to have low COVID-19 death rates.     “Coronavirus binds to ACE2 that induces oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects. Fermented foods have potent antioxidant activity and can protect against severe Covid-19,” Dr Bousquet, the former Chairman of the WHO Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases, noted in the report.  Power of kimchi: In addition to the high antioxidants and vitamin C packed in cabbage, the fermentation process creates probiotics that support the “gut microbiome,” which helps for a better immune response in the body, multiple studies have shown.      In a separate study by the University of Leipzig in Germany, it was found that eating fermented food can give a boost to a person’s immune system.    Earlier research has also pointed out the benefits of healthy intestinal microbiome in fine-tuning the immune system and preventing damaging inflammation inside the body.     Back in April, the New York Post reported on the surge in sales of both sauerkraut and kimchi amid the pandemic.     New York-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medicine Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology clinical chief Dr. Robert Brown attributed such rise in sales in the perception that these types of food will protect them against the virus.     “When there’s a perception that there’s very little else you can do, you want to do something,” Dr. Brown said.  Not a miracle drug: When COVID-19 started to spread globally in January, South Korea’s Health Ministry released a statement warning that kimchi should not be seen as a “wonder drug” against the virus.      In a press release, the ministry cautioned that the Korean staple food provides no protection against the virus, noting that the best protection is frequent hand washing. ",true/false

Experts looked at data on 22,332 confirmed deaths in England since March 31, when pre-existing conditions began to be reported, and found 5,873 were suffering from diabetes. Dementia was the second most common condition linked with COVID mortality, affecting 18 percent of confirmed cases. But just seven percent of patients who died from the respiratory disease had asthma.  The breakdown comes as coronavirus fatalities in the UK rose to 33,614 after 428 more deaths were recorded in the last 24 hours. A total of 233,151 people have now tested positive for the bug across Britain - up 3,446 from yesterday. The death toll refers to those who have died in all settings – including hospitals, care homes, hospices and the community. Around four million Britons are affected by diabetes.  People with the illness have been told they are at higher risk from the pandemic and are being urged to stay indoors as much as possible. Professor Partha Kar, a national speciality advisor for diabetes for the NHS, said: “It is clear that people with diabetes are more at risk of dying from COVID-19 and more detailed analysis is currently underway to understand the link between the two. Initial findings indicate that the threat in people under 40 continues to be very low. “The NHS has put extra measures in place so that people living with diabetes can manage their condition better during the pandemic.  It includes a range of online services, video consultations with your local clinical team and a dedicated helpline for those who need advice.” A separate government survey revealed yesterday that up to 222,000 people in England may be infected with the coronavirus right now. The first round of random tests of 10,000 members of the public has identified only 33 positive cases of COVID-19 and estimated a national infection level of 0.27 percent – one in every 370 people. This suggests that 148,000 people had the virus at any given time between April 27 and May 10, with the official estimate ranging from 94,000 to 222,000. During that time 66,343 people were officially diagnosed.  And the rate of infection is six times higher in healthcare workers and carers than it is in the general population, the survey found. While 1.33 percent of people who worked in patient-facing roles in hospitals or homes tested positive for the virus, only 0.22 percent of those with other jobs did so. The numbers did not include anyone who was tested in a care home or a hospital, where the statisticians said rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be higher. The 33 people who tested positive came from 30 different households, suggesting they either lived alone or most had managed not to infect the people they lived with.",true/false

97,"Are you aware that Australia is currently in the grip of dictatorial tyranny due to a handful of Covid-19 deaths occurring every day? What’s happening in that country has absolutely nothing to do with a virus, and everything to do with control, and you only need to look at what’s going on in the United Kingdom to confirm that. Because the latest Public Health data shows that Covid-19 vaccinated people have accounted for 81% of Covid-19 deaths this summer, whilst UK Government data shows that Covid-19 deaths are over 11 times higher than this time last year, and Office for National Statistics data shows that since teens were first given the Covid-19 vaccine there has been a 63% increase in deaths among teen boys compared to the same period in 2020. The UK is essentially in the midst of a national disaster with a vaccine programme that has clearly failed, but more worryingly has also killed children, and will kill more. because we seem to have a problem in the UK where a huge majority of the population do not believe a single thing unless it is shown on the BBC News. But the data could not be more clear. Just take a look at Public Health Scotland’s latest Covid-19 Statistical report published September 29th. Table 18 of the report shows that the vast majority of Covid-19 deaths between August 21st and September 17th 2021 were among the fully vaccinated population with 233 deaths recorded, accounting for 77% of all Covid-19 deaths. Throw in the 10 deaths to have occurred among the partly vaccinated and that means the vaccinated population accounted for 81% of Covid-19 deaths in Scotland between August 21st and September 17th. UK Health Security Agency (the sinister replacement for Public Health England) data doesn’t look much better either. Table 4 of the report published by UKHSA shows that there were 687 deaths among the unvaccinated, 110 deaths among the partly vaccinated, but a frightening 2,338 deaths among the fully vaccinated between August 30th and September 26th 2021.This means that the unvaccinated account for just 22% of Covid-19 deaths during September 2021, whilst the vaccinated account for a disastrous 78%. And don’t even attempt to argue that this is normal because the majority of the adult population have allegedly been vaccinated. If this were normal then how do you explain the fact that Covid-19 deaths are over twelve times higher than the same period last year when there wasn’t a Covid-19 vaccine available? With only a claimed 95% effectiveness (The latest UKHSA data actually shows the vaccines have a negative efficacy as low as MINUS 66 percent), you would of course expect to still see some Covid-19 deaths. But not when seasonality should be on our side, just like it was in 2020 when deaths dropped to nearly zero. Mix seasonality in with an effective vaccine and you would have thought the UK would have just enjoyed a Covid-19 free summer, but the reality has been far from it.",true/false

The Police have been served with a notice of the crimes committed.  They must all look into the crimes, that have been committed, against every Canadian.  The crimes have been reported. The Police have to investigate those crimes.I think sending old people from hospitals to old folks homes might also constitute a major crime. Like murder.  When old people even get a common cold, they can get very sick and die, A cold can turn into things like pneumonia etc. Old people in care homes have very weak immune system and are vulnerable to all sorts of things. If any of the patients from hospitals had the flu that would be devastating. Torturing them with isolation and keeping their families away long term, is a crime. Many died alone, without their families and friends by their side. That is beyond cruel.  Ottawa Canada: Parliament Hill Protest Feb 14, 2021  Update from February 13, 2021  This should never be done to any child. The want to test the vaccines on babies. Experimenting on Babies as young as 6 months old-Wake up People  Update from February 11, 2021 They tested 44 vaccines.These are just a few things they found in the vaccines: Aluminum, Silicon, Barium, Tungsten, Platinum, Silver, Lead, Copper, Zirconium There are more. How do these metals etc get into vaccines? Aluminum is now used instead of mercury in many, and it is bad for children’s health, but the other ones, that is a whole other story. What harm could they do, I have to wonder? I know many of them are toxic if you breath or eat them. Injecting them must be worse. There really needs to be more in depth studies into all the garbage, in vaccines. My jaw dropped after reading everything they found in them. Metals, Micro- Nanocontamination found in Vaccines  There is a new update to one of the posts below. It was updated February, 4, 2021– 2 More victims have been kidnapped at the airport in Canada.  Update Feb 2, 2021  They did a lot of things back in the day to brain wash people.  They are using many of those techniques to brain wash people now. MK Ultra was used to do just that. There is a massive amount of information about this. Mask wearing/face covering, hoods is one of those techniques. Isolation, and this list goes on. They experimented on children too. I cannot find that part yet. they did make the some of the kids wear masks. They also sexually assaulted the children. I think it was about 500 children they used to experiment on.They controlled every aspect of their lives. Much like what is being done today. Stay home is isolation. Can’t travel farther then 5K of your home is open air prison. Taking away jobs, takes your control over your income and life. The news repeated, the same thing over and over. You can thank Dr Cameron for that. They are still doing that, repeating things that is, only we now have a part 2 a so called second virus. So again everyone hears the same thing over and over for days on end. They want to find a cure for Covid/cold/flu (The vaccines) I advise everyone to find out as much about the techniques, they used and have mastered. MK Ultra never ended. They have used, what they learned and improved those techniques over the years. I am sure they are also using techniques, used by China as well. We are being brain washed. There are still a few videos at youtube about MK Ultra. You might want to check them out and think about how things then, are similar to things now. The end goal is to make everyone feel completely helpless and just do what you are told. The Police are playing a big part in that. They do not help they persecute. They are doing the opposite, of what they should be doing. So, when your really need help, who do you call or turn to? There is no one. That is MK Ultra for sure. Anyone on pharma drugs are more susceptible to all of this. There sure are a lot of them out there. Dr Cameron would be considered a so called expert.  There is some information here on MK Ultra. This is just the tip of the iceberg.  Ted was ex FBI. He investigated many things. Child trafficking and many other areas. He investigated cults. He went down a lot of rabbit holes. He died in 20211. He did leave information behind. I advise downloading and keeping any files you find interesting as the site will vanish. It will give you a small idea of how things worked.  One of those groups is called The Finders, which Ted Gunderson said is operated by the CIA.  A film called The Sleep Room highlighted the brainwashing experiments, including electroshock and sleep therapy, conducted on psychiatric patients by Dr. Ewen Cameron at Montreal’s Allan Memorial Institute in the 1950s and 1960s. Here is the Movie they talk about. A bit over 2 hours long. The Sleep Room The CIA and MK Ultra in Canada., This baced on the truth and can be verified by the Fifth Estate reports, also still on youtube. For all Canadians if you can download those videos, as they will vanish too.  Update Feb 4, 2021  Warning people can just vanish. 2 More victims have been kidnapped at the airport in Canada.  Canada has become a complete insult to human dignity (your friends or relatives could just vanish)  Well I found something that is worse then, Canada or maybe equal too it, a hospital in the US.  Nothing like holding a patient hostage or it could also be considered kidnapping of an old woman. This is not the world anyone wants to live in. This is insanity. The Police are as insane, as the so called Leaders, who are making the world into a dictatorship. Any and all Police should stop pulling this garbage. Their job is to protect the people. Seems world wide in most places, they are doing the opposite. They are waging war against the People. The People who pay their wages by the way. Now imagine if that was your mother, father, child, wife, husband, sister, brother, aunt, uncle or a close friend, in that hospital. How would you feel?  The WHO thinks this is a good idea. They think taking and locking people up is just fine and dandy. They even thin going into your home and taking your kids or whoever is a good idea. Ryan said that a while back.  Community Bands Together to Rescue Elderly Woman Medically Kidnapped  I listened to the WHO press conference for Jan 29, 2021 No mention of vaccines killing or maiming people. They just keep pushing the dangerous vaccines. By the way the vaccine for H1N1 Tedros talked about at the end, harmed a lot of children. For information on that go HERE Loads of information on the horrid things that happened, as well as a lot on how the WHO works with drug companies. Tedros must think everyone in the world is stupid.  They are responsible for many deaths and many more to come, from the Vaccines and the Lock downs.  If anyone trusts them, then they need to get some drastically needed help with that.  The reporters don’t even ask important questions. Like how many have died from the vaccines to date or been harmed.  Update January 30, 2021  The VAERS system is reporting 329 deaths (and we know this is a tiny percentage. Less then 1% that is. ) and close to 10k injured. Go HERE for that information. Or check the VAERS link below.  Update January 30, 2021 Adding VAERS  In the U.S., which relies almost exclusively on passive surveillance, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) Check it out you might be shocked, at what you find.  The site the story came from has updated their story a bit, WHO does change their recommendations rather often. One day they will say one thing and the next week or a month latter, that could change. I did find a video of them saying, to not wear a mask unless you were sick, however. It was from another date of course. But they did say that. They a few weeks ago, changed their mind on the cycles to run the PCR tests at. They lowered the cycles. Which means you get less false positives. But whatever. They have changed their mind on herd immunity I think twice or three times in the past year. Del Bigtee caught that one. They changed, what constitutes a pandemic a while back as well. The Children;s Health Defense caught that one, if I remember correctly. I have that one somewhere, but at the moment I don’t have time to hunt it down. They said lockdowns were good and then lockdowns are bad. I have no idea their thoughts on that one today. They are probably back to saying lockdowna are good. They change things all the time. So one day they could say one thing and then latter change it. Anyway the video in question will be below the story. You might want to download that, if you can. It might vanish like so many other things vanish these days.  There are some studies etc on the dangers of mask wearing in the following post. The BC Parent did some homework and a few other studies/reports have been added as well. Even on most packages they say they do not protect you from viruses.  Message to BC Educators from a Concerned Parent  January 25, 2021  Written by John O’Sullivan  In a telling admission made on January 22, 2021, the World Health Organization now say there is no scientific medical reason for any healthy person to wear a mask outside of a hospital. Sadly, our corrupt politicians and mainstream media only relate the bad news.  If you do not have any respiratory symptoms, such as fever, cough, or runny nose, you do not need to wear a medical mask. When used alone, masks can give you a false feeling of protection and can even be a source of infection when not used correctly.  Watch the video of the press announcement at www.who.in Source  Fauci said don’t wear a mask Now he says wear two of them  Fauci said don’t wear a mask Now he says wear two of them  WHO Admits High-Cycle PCR Tests Produce Massive COVID False Positives  So why are they saying this now?

During COVID Lockdown, Vaccine Rates Dropped — So Did the Number of SIDS Deaths  Just added January 26, 2021  DOCTOR DEMANDS AUDIT OF COVID DEATHS  Family doctor and former Minnesota State Senator Scott Jensen made waves last year when he was one of the first in his field to speak out about the number of #Covid19 deaths thought to be inflated by the CDC’s irregular, and loose, guidelines on diagnosing death from Covid. Now, as the number of deaths has surpassed 400,000 in the US, Dr. Jensen and lawmakers are calling for an audit of these deaths.  in the US they get $12,000 to $13,000 for patients admitted and testing positive for a COVID-19 diagnoses and another $39,000 again give or take, for those put on ventilators. Those number vary a bit from report to report.  If they have 161 covid patients, they get an extra $70,000 per patient. That one I just found out about via the video. Thank you Dr. Jensen. There should be an audit of deaths world wide, as death certificates were also changed in other countries as well. In the UK for example if you died 28 days after testing positive, you were counted as a covid death.  https://www.bitchute.com/video/kaRWlJ0RpYIN/  Las Vegas Schools Forced To Reopen Amid Rash Of Student Suicides  by Tyler DurdenTuesday, Jan 26, 2021 – 17:45  A surge of student suicides across Las Vegas has pushed the Clark County School District to reopen schools as soon as possible, according to NYTimes.  By December, eighteen students in the district had taken their own lives; an early-warning mental health system embedded within computers and tablets issued to students for remote learning received 3,100 alerts since schools shuttered their doors last March.  “When we started to see the uptick in children taking their lives, we knew it wasn’t just the Covid numbers we need to look at anymore,” said Jesus Jara, the Clark County superintendent.  “We have to find a way to put our hands on our kids, to see them, to look at them. They’ve got to start seeing some movement, some hope,” Jara said.  Efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 across the country have led to drastic changes in the way children and teens learn and socialize.  Government data show a 24% increase in the number of children who arrived in emergency departments with mental health issues from mid-March through mid-October, compared with the same period in 2019.  Countrywide, tens of millions of students have been thrown into a new distance learning environment that has resulted in many extracurricular activities being canceled. Recreational spaces have closed, sports canceled, and playdates shifted to Zoom calls, resulting in many kids developing mental issues, especially in Clark County.  Clark County administrators had GoGuardian Beacon alert system installed on every device given out to students after the sixth student suicide last year. The system alerted administrators of more than 3,100 cases where a student searched suicide-related material between June and October.  In one instance, a 12-year boy searched “how to make a noose” on his iPad.” Administrators quickly reached out to the boy’s parents as he was about to hang himself.  The alerts have been so disturbing to Jara that he doesn’t sleep near his phone anymore.  “I can’t get these alerts anymore,” said Jara. “I have no words to say to these families anymore. I believe in God, but I can’t help but wonder: Am I doing everything possible to open our schools?”  Dr. Anthony Fauci has called for schools on a countrywide basis to reopen safely.  An indirect consequence of the pandemic and forcing children to learn at home has contributed to a rise of mental health issues and suicides among America’s future generation.

99,"Nancy Pelosi got to feel like a common criminal today when she refused to comply with a standard search warrant. The FBI, in conjunction with the US Capitol Marshals Service, delivered the warrant to Pelosi’s office to search for “anything and everything pertinent to the investigation into the Deep State shadow government.”  Pelosi, who was already drunk by 9 AM, threw a little temper tantrum and had to be detained “for her own protection as well as those around her.” The warrant was executed and Pelosi was released without incident.  According to the Marshals’ office, they logged 14 boxes of material evidence deemed to be conducive to the ongoing investigation. The Justice Department hasn’t commented, as they’re concerned about leaks from deeply embedded agents from the Obama Administration. The evidence is said to be even more proof that the democrats are the corrupt ones, including some recordings of Hillary Clinton admitting she hired James Comey.  Pelosi may be implicated personally for collusion with a foreign enemy if the ties between the Clintons and Ukraine can be confirmed. There’s also speculation that Pelosi may have had a record of the Uranium One transaction that proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that Hillary sold 20 percent of our country’s nuclear weapons fuel to Russia.  How many Democrats will go down in flames from this last round of search warrants? Plenty, says a spokesman fur John Durham:  “We’ve collected evidence of 17 felonies on the part of Pelosi’s staff, and we’ll be pushing them to talk with immunity agreements. Those who won’t cooperate will find themselves getting used to the weather in Guantanimo Bay.”  The entire ordeal lasted more than 3 hours, with Pelosi complaining the whole time. Her team is now working feverishly to try to have the picture of her in handcuffs deleted from the internet using a House rule that protects her from being slandered in public with ridiculous lies and conspiracy theories. Not that she has a case, since all of this seems to be true.  We’ll keep you updated on this developing story.",true/false

101,"As per a ruling by the Lisbon court, only 0.9% of ‘verified cases’ died of COVID, numbering 152, and not 17,000 as claimed by the government. The ruling has proved that the government faked COVID-19 death statistics.  Following a citizen’s petition, a Lisbon court was forced to provide verified COVID-19 mortality data.  According to the ruling (read full judgment below), the number of verified COVID-19 deaths from January 2020 to April 2021 is only 152, not about 17,000 as claimed by government ministries.  All the “others” died for various reasons, although their PCR test was positive.  The data are from the Sistema de Informação dos Certificados de Óbito (Death Certificate Information System – SICO), the only such system in Portugal.  Subscribe to GreatGameIndia  The reference to 152 death certificated issued ‘under Justice Ministry supervision’ is spurious, as all death certificates are issued under Justice Ministry auspices, being the only institution that issues them.  Last year, a Portuguese appeals court has ruled that PCR tests are unreliable and that it is unlawful to quarantine people based solely on a PCR test.  The court stated, the test’s reliability depends on the number of cycles used and the viral load present. Citing Jaafar et al. 2020, the court concludes that  “if someone is tested by PCR as positive when a threshold of 35 cycles or higher is used (as is the rule in most laboratories in Europe and the US), the probability that said person is infected is less than 3%, and the probability that said result is a false positive is 97%.”  In Germany, it was revealed according to extensive email exchanges obtained by a group of lawyers in a legal dispute, that the German Interior Ministry hired scientists to develop fake coronavirus model in order to justify strict lockdown.

105,"The bombshell claim comes from over 20 hours of Grand Jury testimony released on Friday in the Breonna Taylor case.  Taylor has become the most prominent example from the media, politicians and celebrities that law enforcement must reform from systematic racism.  Much of those claims were already falling apart before today’s news. Taylor was not sleeping in her bed as was suggested but next to her boyfriend in the hallway as officers were being shot at.  Cops were not at the wrong house as was suggested but rather Taylor was the focus of a months long investigation as conspiring with her ex-boyfriend to receive mail and money from an alleged drug operation.  Also revealed months ago was Taylor being interviewed by law enforcement after a car she had rented contained a homicide victim.  According to the Daily Mail, the Grand Jury was presented with evidence that at the scene, Taylor’s boyfriend told cops that it was in fact Taylor that shot at cops.  Among the recordings released is Officer Brett Hankison’s interview with investigators that said Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, had told him ‘she was the one who shot at us’.  Walker later confessed that he was the one who opened fire.  One of Taylor’s neighbors also told investigators that police had told her that ‘some drug-dealing girl shot an officer’.  Officers had a ‘no-knock’ warrant to search Taylor’s apartment for drugs the night when she she was killed and the mainstream media has pushed the false claim that they are “illegal”, and in turn several agencies have abandoned the practice.  In fact, while the warrant was “no knock”, testimony from officers and witnesses revealed that law enforcement spent almost a minute knocking and announcing before using a ram to enter the residence.  ‘We knocked on the door, said police, waited I don’t know 10 or 15 seconds. Knocked again, said police, waited even longer,’ Louisville, Kentucky, police Lt. Shawn Hoover said in an interview recorded the day Taylor was shot.  ‘So it was the third time that we were approaching, it had been like 45 seconds if not a minute,’ Hoover said. ‘And then I said, ‘Let’s go, let’s breach it’.’  In an interview with investigators that was played to the grand jury, Walker said that if officers had announced themselves, ‘it changes the whole situation because there was nothing for us to be scared of.’  One law enforcement officer testified that police ultimately never executed the warrant to search Taylor’s apartment.  ‘Were drugs money or paraphernalia recovered from apartment 4? … The answer to that is no,’ the officer said on the recording.  ‘They didn’t go forward with executing the initial search warrant that they had for Breonna Taylor’s apartment.’  Police used a narcotics warrant to enter Taylor’s Louisville apartment on March 13. The 26-year-old emergency medical worker, was shot five times.  Cameron said two officers who fired their guns, hitting Taylor, were justified because Taylor’s boyfriend had shot at them first. The boyfriend has said he thought someone was breaking in.  The grand jury did charge fired Officer Brett Hankison with three counts of wanton endangerment for shooting into a neighboring apartment. No one was hit.  While the additional information may be shocking to some, what should be more of a concern is the “breaking” story from a foreign media outlet which only shows just how corrupt the American media is.  The same media that never demanded body camera footage in the George Floyd case or even bothered to report that the “neck” restraint was an approved tactic by the agency, are the same ones trying to convince the world that Taylor was simply an innocent girl sleeping in her bed.  We agree with Journalist Jason Whitlock. Indeed, what happened to Taylor is tragic, but to overlook a series of bad decisions on her part to allegedly associate with a known drug dealer and help assist his operation and blame the cops for executing a legal search warrant where they were shot, is plain ridiculous.",true/false
106,"Actor Tom Hanks has left the earth, put to death by a military tribunal that found him guilty of pedophilia and child endangerment.  On June 12, the U.S. military apprehended Hanks after a plane he had chartered in Greece, where he held dual citizenship, landed at Malpensa Airport in Milan, Italy, where Hanks had been scheduled to attend a foreign film festival.  U.S. military sources told RRN that members of the 173rd Airborne Combat Brigade and INTERPOL were awaiting Hanks’ arrival when the Learjet 75 reached the airport apron. Weapons drawn, they boarded the plane and found Hanks seated beside longtime friend Peter Scolari, who in 1980 starred alongside Hanks in the TV sitcom Bosom Buddies, in which the duo portrayed transvestites living in an all-female college dormitory. Hanks would later say it was his favorite role, and that wearing women’s clothes made him feel more manly.  The military released Scolari but shackled and promptly ushered Hanks aboard a waiting C-130, which had to be refueled twice inflight to reach Diego Garcia, where the Office of Military Commissions has built a penitentiary near its B2 bomber base. Upon landing, Hanks was placed in a holding cell to await his military tribunal.  Ten days later, Hanks had his day in court, with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps presenting proof connecting Hanks to a child trafficking ring that, the military alleged, had worked in the shadows for 30 years. It presented into evidence many electronic devices—laptops and cellphones—that held photographs and videos of Hanks engaged in sexual intercourse with male children who were obviously below the age of consent.  Other videos showed Hanks involved in adrenochrome parties, gatherings at which the liberal elite and Hollywood A-listers comingle and inject into themselves an ungodly chemical compound made of oxidized adrenaline, which is extracted from frightened and tortured children, and synthetic opiates. Those who partake in the luciferian ritual believe the compound prevents illness, extends life, and enhances sexual prowess.  One video showed Hanks and songstress Lady GaGa injecting each other while an unseen child’s screams, the wailing sound of death, echoed in the background.  The military’s case was built on 50 video clips and 2,000 images, sources told RRN.  The 3-officer panel, however, found the content so disturbing that it reached a verdict of guilty after watching four snippets.  Hanks, when asked if he had anything to say in his defense, showed no remorse for his crimes and told the tribunal that adult-child intercourse was “natural” and that he proudly supported NAMBLA, the North American Man-Boy Love Association, a pedophilia and pederasty advocacy organization in the United States.  The tribunal declared Hanks receive capital punishment and asked that his sentence be carried out expeditiously.  “My death won’t stop anything; we are everywhere,” Hanks said.  Three days later, Hanks received an injection other than adrenochrome. He was strapped to a gurney and had pancuronium bromide, potassium chloride, and midazolam injected into his veins. If any adrenochrome remained in his blood, it wasn’t potent enough to protect him against lethal injection.  (Visited 474,703 times, 62 visits today)",true/false

Сообщения о русском следе в происхождении так называемого ""гаванского синдрома"" у сотрудников диппредставительств США являются ""фейками русофобского агитпропа"" и выдумками за гранью здравого смысла, заявил заместитель директора Департамента информации и печати МИД РФ Александр Бикантов.Он напомнил, что недавно о симптомах ""гаванского синдрома"" сообщили сотрудники посольства США в Австрии, которые якобы жалуются на постоянные головные боли, головокружения и неспособность концентрироваться. Началось все в 2016 году с жалоб американских дипломатов в Гаване, к которым затем добавились их коллеги из посольства Канады на Кубе.""Правда, канадцы вскоре отыграли назад, когда по итогам совместного с кубинцами расследования выяснилось, что виноваты карибские цикады и применявшиеся для борьбы с комарами фумигаторы"", - напомнил Бикантов.При этом в Вашингтоне ""с упорством, достойным лучшего применения, продолжают передавать СМИ дутые сенсации о ""русском следе"" в злонамеренных действиях на голову своих дипломатов с помощью звуковых, радио- и энергетических волн"".Он посетовал также, что ""любовь западной бульварной прессы к конспирологии неискоренима"".""Советовали бы качественным медиа избегать этого зыбкого поля. Иначе в следующий раз русских придется обвинять в солнечных затмениях или снегопадах. Пределам таким нездоровым фантазиям нет. И мы видим, они будут еще, если за них берутся вашингтонские пропагандисты"", - добавил он.Так называемый ""гаванский синдром"" наблюдался среди дипломатов США на Кубе в 2016 и 2017 годах, а также в КНР в 2018 году. Дипломаты, предположительно, подверглись звуковому воздействию, которое привело к долговременным последствиям для здоровья. Периодически в прессе в США звучали обвинения в адрес России в организации ""акустических атак"", МИД РФ назвал эти обвинения ""полным абсурдом и странными инсинуациями"". Ранее в четверг директор ЦРУ Уильям Бернс заявил, что за необъяснимыми эпизодами ухудшения состояния американских дипломатов может стоять Россия, но сделать сколько-нибудь определенные выводы не позволяет нехватка данных.Случаи недомогания, похожие на ""гаванский синдром"", также, по данным СМИ, были зафиксированы у американских представителей в Африке, Таджикистане и Москве. Последний известный случай необъяснимых недомоганий среди американских дипломатов произошел в Вене. В общей сложности, по данным главы ЦРУ, во всех инцидентах пострадали несколько сотен американских дипломатов, разведчиков и военных, как сообщает CNN, около сотни из них были сотрудниками ЦРУ.  https://ria.ru/20210802/eskalatsiya-1743954495.html  https://ria.ru/20210726/zakharova-1743003934.html  https://ria.ru/20210712/krazha-1740918941.html  вена  африка  россия  РИА Новости 1 5 4.7 96 internet-group@rian.ru 7 495 645-6601 ФГУП МИА «Россия сегодня» https://xn--c1acbl2abdlkab1og.xn--p1ai/awards/ 353 60 353 60  2021  РИА Новости 1 5 4.7 96 internet-group@rian.ru 7 495 645-6601 ФГУП МИА «Россия сегодня» https://xn--c1acbl2abdlkab1og.xn--p1ai/awards/ 353 60 353 60  Новости  ru-RU  https://ria.ru/docs/about/copyright.html  https://xn--c1acbl2abdlkab1og.xn--p1ai/  РИА Новости 1 5 4.7 96 internet-group@rian.ru 7 495 645-6601 ФГУП МИА «Россия сегодня» https://xn--c1acbl2abdlkab1og.xn--p1ai/awards/ 353 60 353 60  1920 1080 true  1920 1440 true  1920 1920 true  РИА Новости 1 5 4.7 96 internet-group@rian.ru 7 495 645-6601 ФГУП МИА «Россия сегодня» https://xn--c1acbl2abdlkab1og.xn--p1ai/awards/ 353 60 353 60  РИА Новости 1 5 4.7 96 internet-group@rian.ru 7 495 645-6601 ФГУП МИА «Россия сегодня» https://xn--c1acbl2abdlkab1og.xn--p1ai/awards/ 353 60 353 60  вена, африка, министерство иностранных дел российской федерации (мид рф), уильям бернс, россия",true/false
108,"Joe Biden’s Inauguration has been cancelled, President Trump would remain in office and the Chinese Communist Party propaganda media outlets of ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC would soon be off the airwaves according to President Trump.  “I have invoked the Insurrection Act of 1807 Section 10 U.S. Code 13 251-255 to address the treasonous rebellion conducted by Democrat and Republican lawmakers, CCP Agents Chinese Communist Party, FBI, Department of Justice, CIA and others to dismantle the United States of America and it’s Constitution,” President Trump declared on Thursday 14 Jan. “These entities pose a direct threat to national security. I will remain President indefinitely until all domestic enemies are arrested.”  President Trump invoked the Insurrection Act after another assassination attempt on him last Sat. morning 9 Jan. According to his Intel, Chinese Communist Party Agents, the FBI, Department of Justice, CIA and others of the Deep State have – with the help of the Main Stream Media – long been planning to dismantle the US and it’s Constitution.  Of course, none of these treasonous acts have been reported by the corrupt Main Stream Media. Trump had evidence that the MSM was “embedded with CIA and Chinese Communist Party agents whose sole purpose was to direct public opinion toward a Deep State agenda.”  During President Trump’s four years in office he and what has been referred to as the Alliance have been fighting this Cabal – a Satan worshipping force composed of thirteen Satanist Bloodline families out of Italy, the Vatican, UK Monarchy, British M16, Chinese Communist Party, CIA, FBI, Department of Justice, Antifa, Black Lives Matter and certain Republican and Democratic Lawmakers. Another attempt on his life was the last straw.  Since that Sat. 9 Jan. the US has been under an abbreviated Martial Law with President Trump as Commander in Chief and General Flynn in charge of the Military. As such Trump has signed multiple Executive Orders that among other powers, allowed for Military arrests and Tribunals.  Soon to be acted upon were well over 222,286 sealed indictments against political and global elites filed in federal courts across the nation.  https://operationdisclosure.blogspot.com/2021/01/sealed-indictments-as-of-december-31.html#more  By law with the Insurrection Act in effect, Trump would remain President indefinitely until all domestic enemies were arrested. He would soon take down the Main Stream Media.  “I’m drafting an Executive Order to take the following propaganda media outlets off the airwaves: ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC. I am also working with the FCC to pull their licenses. We have evidence that all of these media organizations employ agents of the Chinese Communist Party as well as embedded CIA Agents whose sole purpose is to brainwash, hypnotize and direct public opinion toward certain agendas that support the Left and Deep State. These organizations are a threat to national security and virtually nothing they report is actual news.”  It’s no small task to take down the Cabal. Military and Special Forces units have been deploying all over the US in 400+ cities. Right now there were over 15,000 troops in DC according to Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy. Special Forces units have covertly infiltrated Antifa and Black Lives Matter and made silent covert arrests.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4_DNABtptU  That same Sat. 9 Jan. POTUS and the Department of Defense postponed the 20 Jan. Presidential Inauguration. Intel sources claimed that if Joe Biden was not inaugurated there were corrupt-FBI plans to help stage Antifa and BLM violence in DC and at the 50 state capitols from Sat 16 Jan. through Wed. 20 Jan. Biden couldn’t be inaugurated anyway because of the Insurrection Act that demanded Trump remain in office “until all domestic enemies were arrested.”  A corrupt Mass Media has refused to report anything but their Left Wing agenda believed paid for by the CCP. Thus, the President has announced he would soon activate the Emergency Broadcast System EBS. This was expected during what has been referred to as Ten Days of Darkness, or media outage.  With the EBS everyone would get alerts on their phones, TV, radio and Internet that would override other broadcasts for several hours at a time. The broadcasts would explain the silent war happening across the globe between the Cabal and Alliance.  This week Trump Intel providers Robert David Steele and Juan OSavin explained, “This may not be settled until April 1. Anyone including Fox, who refuses to broadcast the President of the US faces loss of their FCC licenses as well as criminal punitive actions, perhaps a military takeover.”  On Wed. 13 Jan. in an urgent message to the American people President Trump called for peace. Intel sources were reporting that riots were planned in DC and across the nation. He condemned the rioters at the state capitol, as well as a recent assault by Social Media on our Freedom of Speech and then activated military forces to quell unrest.  https://trendingpolitics.com/breaking-president-trump-releases-urgent-video-message-to-the-american-people/  The recent violation of Social Media platforms to censor Freedom of Speech was of concern. Donald Trump Jr. to the rescue. Trump Jr. announced that a new social media platform was coming soon called the Freedom Social Network.  More important, President Trump had officially shut down the Cabal’s USA Inc. and re-started a restored Republic on 4 July 2020.  https://web.archive.org/web/20110720183531/http://reality-bytes.hubpages.com/hub/The-Corporation-Of-The-United-States-Of-America  It was all a part of the Alliance’s Plan to free the globe of the Communist Parties /Cabal’s suppression of The People. “The Plan To Save The World”:  https://rumble.com/vagd07-q-the-plan-to-save-the-world-remastered.html  https://www.bitchute.com/video/qvfUkQTG5QHP/  As part of that plan President Trump’s Space Force has been involved in worldwide blackouts in multiple countries as Alliance Special Force units made arrests. Overnight to Sun. 10 Jan. multiple arrests were conducted, including in Frankfurt Germany – home of the CIA office where Dominion Voting machines illegally changed Trump votes to Biden in the 2020 Election.  Over last weekend French and Russia Alliance military leaders’ Special Force units took out Deep Staters in Italy, Pakistan, Berlin and Paris. By the first of the week they had moved to Iran where they caused Blackouts in order to target global and regional terrorism.  By Tues. 12 Jan. the White House had launched the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office. This officially activated Space Force and it’s Quantum Computer that would put us and the world on the Gold Standard, provide a transparent and instantaneous Quantum Voting System for our first Restored Republic Election in March 2021, plus provided the platform for a top secret Global Broadcast Satellite Program that could override all TV screens for President Trump’s worldwide addresses.  During this coming weekend to 20 Jan. there may be food and supply shortages, on-off outages of communication, media and social media, plus ATM and credit card transaction disruptions. You were advised to be prepared.  The Alliance was composed of President Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi, India Prime Minister Narendra Modi, White Hats in the Department of Defense headed by Secretary of Defense Chris Miller, Undersecretary of Defense Intel Ezra Cohen Watnick and Gen. Michael T Flynn, Q composed of around 800 special ops who advise President Trump including Pentagon Generals Chairman Joint Chief Mark Milley, Vice Chief John Hyten, Gen. James McConville, Adm. Michael Gilday, Gen. C.Q. Brown, Gen. Paul Nakasone and Gen. Jay Raymond, QAnons volunteer Patriots headed by JF Kennedy Jr., the National Security Agency and various militaries across the globe in SOF Units, including the international force authorized to make arrests in any country, Interpol, plus the US Marines, National Guard and Special Ops Units.",true/false
109,"Since the outbreak of the deadly pandemic crisis that’s been running rampant in the United States, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York has been taking every opportunity he can to overshadow *President Trump and add his “expertise” to the conversation. His constant, daily beseeching of aid for his especially-hard-hit state has become rote. And now his friend Speaker Nancy Pelosi is handing out a favor.  Pelosi is no stranger to pillaging our social security money in fictional satire articles. Even though it is literally impossible for her to do such a thing, the intellectually-troubled Trump supporting crowd will shoot up and spill their colostomy bags all over themselves to excoriate her about it every time because the Homestyle Buffet is still closed and the repeats of Big Bang Theory are finally becoming annoying. Old people can’t understand jokes about Ray Palmer having a tiny dick.  Sandy Batt of New York’s Hey I’m Walkin’ Here magazine wrote a short essay on the Empire State and it’s treatment:  “On 9/11, New York had the sympathy of the whole country and the solidarity of US against those who wanted to destroy us. Now that Trump is in the White House, suddenly the pretend patriots who run under his shorts sniffing his balls don’t care. As long as the pandemic hasn’t reached Cousinhumper, Kentucky, they figure, Jesus will handle it. If you needed any more proof that Trump is the worst *President in history, he’s basically encouraged his traitorous followers to split back to the Civil War battle lines. That takes full on seditionist work. You know, it almost makes it okay if Pelosi COULD take that money. They deserve to lap up Alpo in their trailers.”  The fictional billions that the Speaker is functionally transferring will help shore up necessary aid and projects in New York, which is the number one state contributing to America’s tax base. Trumpers would do well to remember that blue States and Democrats provide them with aid when they take too much oxy and need reviving drugs or get hit with a hurricane and need a place to stay, eat, and remain safe. They’ll be thanking future President Cuomo.  *Impeached",true/false
110,"By Cassandra Fairbanks and Jim Hoft  On Tuesday, November 3rd President Trump was ahead of Joe Biden in the swing state of Michigan by over 100,000 votes. This appeared to be another solid win for President Trump in Michigan with a greater margin than his 2016 victory. The ballot counting in Detroit, Michigan on election night took place at the TCF Center, formerly known as Cobo Hall.  This is the site where Detroit City Officials put cardboard over the windows to prevent the GOP observers from seeing in, where poll workers were militantly hostile to the GOP observers, and where hundreds of affidavits by election observers claim they witnessed voter fraud.  At least three election observers testified in sworn affidavits that they witnessed vehicles delivering fraudulent ballots to the TCF Center early in the morning on November 4th.  TRENDING: LAWRENCE SELLIN: The Second American Civil War is Underway  Michigander Shane Trejo witnessed the 3:30 am Biden Ballot Drop that gave Joe Biden an outstanding lift. “There were thousands of ballots in each box,” Trejo says. “There were at least 50 boxes that I saw unloaded at 3:30 am, well after the 8:00 pm deadline for ballots to show up.”  The 3:30 am was the first ballot delivery since 10:30 pm when 138,000 ballots showed up suddenly. Shane later testified that he noticed that the city of Detroit Clerk’s Office and its emblem were written on the white van that showed up with the ballots. City Clerk Janice Winfrey‘s name was on the van and a number presumably for Janet Winfrey’s office. Trejo says the ballots could not be processed when they arrived, so by the time they were counted, a new shift of poll workers had come in for the day.  After these ballot drops Joe Biden took the lead in Michigan.  Shane Trejo explained how the timing was important. The Biden Ballot Drop took place at the end of one shift. The ballots were left uncounted. So when the new shift came to count ballots they didn’t know where the ballots had come from.  Trejo repeatedly asked about this truck to site supervisors and was STONEWALLED.  Former Michigan State Senator Pat Colbeck was also present at the TCF Center on the morning of November 4th. Senator Colbeck also witnessed the 3:30 am Biden Ballot Drop. Colbeck spoke with The Gateway Pundit back in November, “I went back there and I witnessed a mini-panel truck if you will with a Detroit Election Bureau regalia all over the side and a vehicle ID number on it… And inside of it, and this gets into some chain of custody discussions, there was no indication that there was a Republican and a Democrat (present) during transfer. We don’t know if they stopped by a sidestreet in Coney Island and picked up a few more ballots during transfer. We have no way of verifying any of that information.”  The authorities and media in Michigan were completely uninterested in following up on this shocking story.  Until today, no one has bothered to review the video footage from the TCF Center on election night.  The Gateway Pundit requested the TCF video back in December!  The TCF Center tried to quote us over $22,000 for one day’s worth of video.  We requested two hours of video.  Last Friday we were sent the requested video.  Since last week we have been combing through the hundreds of hours of security camera footage from the TCF Center on the morning of November 4th.  And what we found is a political bombshell.  ** At 3:23 AM The Gateway Pundit has exclusive video of a white van registered to the city of Detroit entering the gate into the TCF Center.  ** At 3:25 AM we discovered video from a second camera showing three individuals unloading over 50 boxes of ballots in a hallway inside the TCF Building and just outside the counting room.  ** The ballots were then wheeled away on carts into the ballot counting room.  ** The van is then seen on video leaving the center about 25 minutes later.  ** Then we saw the van returning an hour later, entering the TCF Center again and unloading more boxes of ballots.  ** The white van was escorted by a black sports car for both ballot deliveries.  ** The white van was allowed through an electronic gate to enter the TCF complex.  This is video proof of the fraud in Detroit, Michigan. It is exactly as the GOP observers described it to us back in November!  We have more damning video from the TCF Center to release in the coming days.  Here is our video on the election fraud in the Detroit TCF Center on election night:  Special thanks to Cassandra Fairbanks who did an outstanding job on this project.  ** PLEASE SUPPORT THE GATEWAY PUNDIT’S DOCUMENTATION OF MICHIGAN VOTER FRAUD.

111,"For once, it’s not President Trump making headlines for a Saturday morning tweet – at least not as the sender. Senator Marco Rubio R-FL did the honors this time after he fired-off a biblical quote over the popular social media platform this morning targeting the president and his sycophantic minions.  President Trump appeared at a campaign-style rally last night in Pensacola, Florida to stump for accused sexual predator Roy Moore, who’s running in a special election next week in nearby Alabama to fill the senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  In addition to the de rigueur attacks on Democratic leaders and the “fake news” media that form the backbone of Trump’s rambling speeches at these events, the president added a new twist: victim-shaming the women who have accused Moore of sexually assaulting them, of which there are 9 in total, two of whom were attacked when they were minors.  The crowd, composed largely of Rubio’s fellow Floridians, ate it all up, cheering and howling every time Trump lobbed one of these verbal molotov cocktails. It was this display that moved the normally mild mannered Senator from Miami to lash out on Twitter and throw Republicans from his own state under the bus:  At the sight of the crowds his heart was moved with pity 4 them b/c they were troubled & abandoned like sheep without a shepherd.Matthew9:36 — Marco Rubio @marcorubio December 9, 2017  Add your name to millions demanding Congress take action on the President’s crimes. IMPEACH TRUMP & PENCE!  There certainly is no love lost between Sen. Rubio and President Trump. The two clashed during the Republican primary, with Trump famously nicknaming Rubio “Little Marco.” Once Trump locked-up the Republican nomination, Rubio withheld his support until the very last minute, and he was quick to criticize the candidate whenever his campaign hit the rocks.  As harsh a critic as he was during the campaign, however, Rubio has been a staunch supporter of President Trump’s agenda in the only way that really matters: with his vote in the senate. These tweets and other critiques are amusing, but they do absolutely nothing to oppose the destruction caused by someone Rubio once called a “dangerous con-man.”  If he really holds this low of an opinion of the president and his base supporters, then it would be nice to see that opposition reflected in his voting record.  Add your name to millions demanding Congress take action on the President’s crimes. IMPEACH TRUMP & PENCE!",true/false
112,"By Dr. James Stangle, DVM, Milesville, SD  ?The impossible whopper is being advertised by Burger King as a plant based alternative to the whopper. When food manufacturers started talking about making artificial meat, I, too, thought it would be impossible to make a hamburger cheaply enough to make it competitive. You see, I assumed that they would have to buy the individual amino acids the building blocks for protein and chemically string them together in the proper order, then remove the reagents chemicals needed to cause the chain reactions and then add something to give it the right textures.  ?The impossible whopper made by Impossible Foods bypassed all of those steps. Let’s compare the two. The impossible whopper patty is made from 24 ingredients. The most important ingredient is soy protein. The whopper patty has just one ingredient. That would be beef.  ?The impossible whopper has 630 calories, mostly from the added oils. The whopper has 660 calories. So, about 5% less calories, this is not a huge improvement.  The impossible whopper has 25 grams of protein. The whopper has 28 grams. Seems pretty equal, only 11% less protein in the impossible whopper. However, not all proteins are created equal. There are 20 amino acids. Nine of which are essential, meaning your body cannot make them so they are required in the diet. Each of those essential amino acids must meet a certain level to make a complete protein profile. If any essential amino acid does not hit the required amount, it is said to be rate limiting. As an analogy, picture nine chains connected in a line. All of the chains need to lift 100 pounds to carry the load. If one chain can only support 50 pounds, it doesn’t matter how much the others can support. The 50 pound chain is the rate limiting chain.  ?As an extreme example, bovine gelatin, aka Jell-O, is 100% protein; however, it completely lacks the essential amino acid histidine. Therefore, its value as a protein is zero. In beef the rate limiting amino acid is tryptophan, which is at 79% of the required level. In soy protein, the rate limiting amino acid is methionine, which is at 41% of the required level. So, to compare the impossible whopper with the whopper, you have to take 0.41 x 25 grams of protein and compare it to 0.79 x 28 grams of protein. The impossible whopper has 10 grams of usable protein and the whopper has 22 grams of usable protein. So you would have to eat two and a quarter impossible whoppers to get the same protein in one whopper.  ?Now, let’s compare the estrogen hormone in an impossible whopper to the whopper made from hormone implanted beef. The impossible whopper has 44 mg of estrogen and the whopper has 2.5 ng of estrogen. Now let me refresh your metric system. There are 1 million nanograms ng in one milligram mg. That means an impossible whopper has 18 million times as much estrogen as a regular whopper. Just six glasses of soy milk per day has enough estrogen to grow boobs on a male. That’s the equivalent of eating four impossible whoppers per day. You would have to eat 880 pounds of beef from an implanted steer to equal the amount of estrogen in one birth control pill.  There is one ingredient in the impossible whopper that bears mentioning. Beefs red color comes from hemoglobin, the oxygen binding protein in blood, and myoglobin, the molecule that takes the oxygen away from the hemoglobin. To get the same red color in an impossible whopper, they used leghemoglobin. This is the cool part. Leghemoglobin is made by the bacteria, Rhizobium. Rhizobium is the crucial bacterium that lives in the nodules of the roots of legumes like soybeans. Rhizobium has an enzyme that can take nitrogen from the air and turn it into fertilizer, which the plant can use. The bacterial enzyme that binds the nitrogen is damaged by the presence of oxygen so the bacterium makes the leghemoglobin to bind oxygen to keep it out of the way. To make enough leghemoglobin to add to the impossible whopper, scientists spliced the gene for leghemoglobin into yeast. They can grow the yeast easily and separate the leghemoglobin and add it to the impossible whopper. So the impossible whopper is technically a genetically modified organism GMO. Don’t get me wrong, I think it’s cool. I’m all in favor of GMO’s. More should be done with them to improve our food supply. Currently, the only GMO protein that is legal in the US is a GMO salmon that is engineered to grow twice as fast. Unfortunately, the production and sale of it in the US is blocked by Senator, Lisa Murkowsky R. Alaska. No doubt to protect Alaska’s salmon industry. Scientists have made a GMO milk cow which is modified to be polled hornless yet neither its meat nor milk is allowed to enter the food supply. What’s funny about the impossible whopper being a GMO is that the people most likely to eat it are the ones most likely to be against GMO’s.  ?So when you watch the next Burger King commercial and you see the guy dressed as a cowboy eating an impossible whopper saying, “Well, I’m a darn fool”. “Just say, yep!” There is another word for really big lie. It is called a whopper. Here’s to hoping that the impossible whopper is a possible flopper.  By Dr. James Stangle, DVM, Milesville, SD",true/false
113,"US Under Military Law, Congress Arrested, War With CCP Won and No One Knows It      Joe Biden was sworn in as president of a bankrupt and defunct US Inc. Corporation. Just prior to his pre-recorded-in-Hollywood-by-Castle Rock Entertainment Inauguration, Washington DC, Capitol Hill and the White House were secured within miles of barbed wire fences and 60,000 National Guard troops.  Now over a week later, over 30,000 troops and the barbed wire fencing remained. Why?  An answer came early Mon. morning 25 Jan. when from 3am to 6am arrests of 80 to 140 Congress people appeared to be underway at Capitol Hill – after which Congress seemed to have disappeared. Why? https://www.bitchute.com/video/oYzu0wcwa3GE/ House cancels business during first full Biden week – Washington Times US Military at the White House Arresting Congress | Politics | Before It’s News  In reality an Interim Military US Government had taken over Washington DC and was running our country. The two US governments: 1 a legitimate Interim Military US Government empowered by the Constitution and the Department of Defense under Military Code 11.3, and 2 an illegal, fraudulent foreign paid-for, foreign controlled on the foreign ground of the District of Columbia Biden Administration.  The US Military appeared to be in charge of Biden and making him sign blank Executive Orders on a stage set of the Oval Office. The White House was said to be empty. Why? https://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?read=164754  The whole operation began way last Jan. 2020 during a government shutdown. President Trump was said to have reorganized several agencies including the US Treasury, IRS and Federal Reserve. Now the US Military had control of all assets including taxpayer dollars at the new US Treasury near Reno. Why?  The Military had been tasked with conducting a return to a gold/asset-backed dollar and to insure that the US Republic was restored to original laws of the Constitution as written prior to 1871. http://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?read=115613  This was all made possible after a Sat. 9 Jan 2021 raid by US Military Special Op Teams on CIA Headquarters in Langley Virginia. The raid produced firm evidence that the CIA, Democrats and other traitors had conspired with foreign entities led by the Chinese Communist Party CCP, to interfere in the 2020 Election.  Earlier that Saturday morning 9 Jan. there had been two attempts on Trump and his wife Melania’s lives there were said to have been twelve plus such attempts since he gained office.  Trump had had enough. He immediately instigated the Insurrection Act put into law by George Bush Jr. after 9/11, and then turned his authority over to the US Military.  With the nation now under Martial Law, Trump would remain as US President until all those who committed treason were arrested, including those who certified the illegal 2020 Election.  Some in the Pentagon had been preparing for this for over twenty years. US Attorney General for Utah John Huber and his 740 investigators had been very busy since 2016. The US government was corrupt throughout including Congress and the three letter agencies. There were a lot of traitors whose cases had already been processed through State Grand Juries. There was an estimated 80 to 140 Congress people thought named in over 223,000 sealed indictments filed in federal courts since Trump took office.  Of those, 85% to 95% indicted were Democrats, intermixed with a few Rino Republicans. The majority of charges were said to be pedophilia, child exploitation, misappropriation of US Taxpayer funds and conspiring with foreign powers to influence the 2020 Presidential Election – an act of Treason. Some serious charges couldn’t be brought because Obama pardoned so many in his last days in office.  By Jan. 2 2020 Military Tribunals were said to have already began at GITMO for high profile elites such as the Clintons, Obamas and Bushes. Charges against them were believed to include Capital High Treason, Election Fraud, Child Sex Trafficking, Money Laundering, Misappropriation of US Taxpayer Funds, plus Uranium One, 9/11 and Benghazi crimes.  Deep State Special prosecutor Robert Mueller was believed to have been charged for his involvement in the 9/11 cover-up he was appointed FBI Director 7 days before 9/11 and oversaw 9/11 so-called “investigations”, plus he conducted an ongoing fake Russian witch-hunt against Trump. https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/168059921/  It was no wonder the Democrats wanted to impeach Trump, again. On Thurs. 28 Jan. certain traitors in both the House and Senate did in fact recognize Trump as the acting US President when they voted, again, to try to impeach him. Under rules of the Constitution you could not impeach a US President if he didn’t presently hold the office.  Donald Trump wasn’t worried about being impeached from the presidency of the bankrupt and defunct US Corporation. He had other plans. On 11 Jan. 2021 Donald Trump was inaugurated as head of the Patriot or Constitutional Party, which made him a candidate for US President, again.  The US Military was about to restore the US Republic to laws underlying the original Constitution as written prior to 1871. That election was planned to be held on 4 March 2021 through use of a transparent, secure and instantaneous Quantum Voting Computer where citizens could vote using their own computers, or phones.  For many years the Chinese Communist Party not the Chinese government, which was working to become a democracy had been involved in a takeover of America. That war culminated when just prior to the 2020 US Presidential Election, the CCP bought Dominion Voting machines that through use of an Italian satellite loaned with money at the Vatican, threw what was believed to be millions of Trump votes to Biden. And, the CIA raid proved it all.  The war between the CCP and the US actually ended on Thurs. 28 Jan. Former Navy Intelligence officer Simeon Parkes reported a showdown in the South China Sea. The CCP had been trying to take over Taiwan. Taiwan was where gold was stored that would back countries including the US, for a Global Currency Reset. Parks said that there were air battles between America and Taiwan fighter jets against CCP jets and “the CCP lost big time.”  The New World Order fans had lost their war. A banker source out of Zurich said they had promised to settle everything by Fri. 29 Jan. https://www.simonparkes.org/blog  Rinus Verhagen reported that “the CCP has abandoned their Big Restart Operation and the liberal elite-scheduled reboot of Globalism has failed. Operation COVID-19, expressed in the book “Great Restoration” by Klaus Schwab, President of the Davos Global Economic Forum, has also failed. The CCP would not impose a Global Order. Their power, like any commercial empire, was limited to an economic expansion.” http://www.takecare4.eu/panic-in-dc/ Take care 4 –  Please Support beforeitsnews, By Trying Some Of Our Health Products, By Following This Link To Our Health Supplement Store!

Is there thirty billion dollars in there? No? Then your last name isn’t “Obama”, and you don’t own your own private “safe island” where you and your family and friends can wait out any crisis that the unwashed masses have to suffer through.  Preparations to have every tree on the island set up to stream Netflix will be finished by April.  Two days ago, while you and I were washing our hands and not going to the theater to see whatever terrible movie the distributors release in March before saving all the good ones for May, June, and July, the Obama family flew by private jet liner to their private safe island, somewhere in the Pacific tropics, where they will remain safe and sound from any harm. Several friends and family members flew in on later flights, including religious leader Al Sharpton, actor Jussie Smolette, and basketball star Joe Barron.  The multi-billion dollar island, dubbed “Smoovy-O-Town” on nautical charts is over thirty-six miles in area.

The recount of the presidential election in Wisconsin's two most heavily Democratic counties began Friday with President Donald Trump's campaign seeking to discard tens of thousands of absentee ballots that it alleged should not have been counted. AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh  MADISON, Wis. AP — The recount of the presidential election in Wisconsin’s two most heavily Democratic counties began Friday with President Donald Trump’s campaign seeking to discard tens of thousands of absentee ballots that it alleged should not have been counted.  Trump’s three objections attempting to discard the ballots were denied by the three-member Dane County Board of Canvassers, twice on bipartisan votes. Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell said he expected the campaign was building a record before filing a lawsuit.  Joe Biden won Wisconsin by 20,600 votes and carried Dane and Milwaukee counties by a 2-to-1 margin . Trump only paid for recounts in those two counties, not in the 70 others, 58 of which he won.  There’s no precedent for a recount overturning a deficit as large as Trump’s in Wisconsin, so his strategy is widely seen as seeking to build a case to take to court.  His team on Friday sought to have ballots discarded where election clerks filled in missing address information on the certification envelope where the ballot is inserted; any absentee ballot where a voter declared themselves to be “indefinitely confined” under the law; and any absentee ballot where there was not a written application on file, including roughly 69,000 that were cast in-person during the two weeks before Election Day.  Trump attorney Christ Troupis argued that certification envelopes filled out by people who voted absentee in-person do not count under the law as a written application, even though the envelope is identified as such. The board of canvassers, controlled 2-1 by Democrats, voted unanimously to reject the complaint.  Troupis also argued that people claimed to be indefinitely confined even though they were not. Such a declaration exempts the voter from having to show a photo ID to cast their ballot, which Troupis called “an open invitation for fraud and abuse.” The Republican-controlled Wisconsin Supreme Court this spring ruled that it is up to individual voters to determine whether they are indefinitely confined, in line with guidance from the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission.  The canvassing board voted 2-1 to count those ballots, with the Republican opposed.  ADVERTISEMENT  Trump’s attorney also claimed that the law does not allow clerks to fill in missing information on the envelope that goes with absentee ballots. The state elections commission told clerks before the election that they can fill in missing information on the absentee ballot envelopes, a practice that has been in place for at least the past 11 elections.  The canvassing board voted unanimously to count those ballots.  In Milwaukee, the canvassing board agreed to Trump’s request to set aside all absentee ballot envelopes where voters claimed “indefinitely confined” status and those with two different colors of ink, perhaps indicating that someone other than the voter completed the information.  A Trump challenge in Milwaukee to reject and not count absentee ballots in envelops altered by clerk staff to fix addresses or other errors was dismissed by election officials, Biden campaign attorney, Danielle Friedman, said in a call with reporters Friday night.  In limited counting so far, she said the vote tally for Biden has changed little, adding there have been “no changes on the scale that would change the result” and that “the Trump campaign seems aware of that fact.”  “They’re not actually interested in recounting the votes,” she said.  Although the ballots in altered envelopes would be counted, they will still be segregated. It’s a move to keep such ballots separated in case of potential legal challenges in coming days.  Trump also asked to separate absentee ballots with or without written applications and to observe absentee ballot logs that would account for those requested through the state’s myvote.wi.gov website. Unlike in Dane County, Trump’s campaign in Milwaukee initially asked only to review those ballots and others, not to have them discounted.  In both Madison and Milwaukee, the recounts were taking place in large convention centers so workers could be distanced to protect against spreading the coronavirus. Observers were required to wear masks and plexiglass shields were aset up.  Milwaukee County Clerk George Christenson, a Democrat, said it was irresponsible of Trump to force the recount amid the pandemic that is surging in Wisconsin .  “It just shows his lack of empathy toward the American people,” Christenson said.  In Milwaukee, the Rev. Greg Lewis, founding president of groups of faith leaders who sought to bolster Black turnout, said the recount highlights the “oppression, disenfranchisement, downright racism and disrespect” that minority communities in Milwaukee face.  “I almost died and we are running around here counting votes unnecessarily,” said Lewis, who contracted COVID-19 earlier this year. “This is nonsense. This is pitiful. Why do we keep putting up with this? The people have decided, let it be.”  There have been at least 31 recounts in statewide elections in the U.S. since the most famous one in Florida’s presidential election in 2000. The recounts changed the outcome of three races. All three were decided by hundreds of votes, not thousands.  ___  This story has been updated to correct the spelling of the first name of Trump attorney Christ Troupis.  ___  Associated Press writer Michael Tarm contributed to this report from Milwaukee.",true/false

During his appearance on CBS' Face The Nation program on Sunday, Sullivan was asked about what US President Joe Biden's team was going to do about the SolarWinds hack, given that sanctions have proven to be ineffective against Moscow. The adviser replied by saying that the American “response will include a mix of tools seen and unseen.” He didn’t specify what those ‘tools’ might be. And it will not simply be sanctions because, as you say, a response to a set of activities like this require a more comprehensive set of tools, and that is what the administration intends to do.

We will ensure that Russia understands where the US draws the line on this kind of activity. The SolarWinds breach was reported in December, becoming one of the largest and most sophisticated cyberattacks to date. The hackers were able to insert software backdoors into a widely used network-management program, distributed by the Texas-based SolarWinds company. This allowed them to compromise the systems of more than 100 commercial firms globally, as well as nine US government agencies, with the breach only discovered eight or nine months later.

118,"MPs are facing a backlash after voting against amending a bill to stop water companies dumping raw sewage into Britain's rivers and seas.  Just 22 Conservatives rebelled against the Government last week by voting for an amendment to the Environment Bill which sought to place a legal duty on water companies not to pump sewage into rivers.  Sewage pollution is a key component of what MPs have heard is a chemical cocktail of pollutants going into rivers, with raw sewage being discharged into waters more than 400,000 times last year.  It comes seven weeks after wastewater plants were told by the government they may dispose of sewage not fully treated due to a shortage of chemicals caused by the lorry driver crisis.  The amendment, introduced in the House of Lords by the Duke of Wellington, would have also forced water companies and the Government to 'take all reasonable steps' to avoid using the combined sewer overflows, which regularly release untreated waste into rivers and seas.  Campaign groups including Surfers Against Sewage said it was crucial to ensure action to tackle sewage pollution started now.  But Environment Secretary George Eustice recommended MPs reject amendments to the bill, just days before Boris Johnson hosts world leaders at the Cop26 climate change summit in Glasgow.  The vote caused a huge backlash on social media, with Twitter users posting images of the MPs who shot down the amendment.

Supply chain issues affect levels of sewage treatment chemicals Wastewater plants were told by the government last month that they may dispose of sewage not fully treated due to a shortage of chemicals caused by the lorry driver crisis. Some of the chemicals used in the sewage treatment process became one of the products left in short supply by the driver shortage, caused by a combination of Brexit and the Covid pandemic. Plants were told they may dispose of effluent not fully treated because of disruption caused by 'supply chain failure' in a regulatory position statement issued at the start of September. The statement came from the Environment Agency, which introduced a waiver that would allow some companies to bypass the third stage in the treatment process if they are not in possession of the right chemicals. Defra (the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) said the waiver specifically related to a shortage of ferric sulphate, an acidic solution used to suppress the growth of algae. The government agency said the regulatory position statement (RPS) would apply until the end of the year, after which companies would required a permit in order to continue the practice. Advertisement  Another wrote: 'I just emailed me MP asking her to outline the benefits of raw sewage being dumped into our waterways.'  A government source told MailOnline: 'Tory MPs have categorically not voted to allow water companies to dump raw sewage into our rivers and seas. The provisions in the Environment Bill will deliver progressive reductions in the harm caused by storm overflows. The Environment Bill requires us to set a target to drive progress on water quality, and we are already taking significant action to address water quality more widely. Claims to the contrary are simply wrong.'  The measure is now set to return to the Lords on Tuesday, where peers are expected to send it back to the Commons later next week - possibly on Thursday - and force another vote among MPs.  The Duke of Wellington, a crossbench peer, said he believed the amendment would stimulate investment in improving the systems, which date back decades and are in severe need of upgrades.  It comes as figures collected by charity the Rivers Trust show that all of England's rivers are currently failing to pass cleanliness tests, with 53 per cent of them in a poor state at least partly because of water companies releasing raw and partially-treated sewage.  In England, just 14 per cent of rivers have good ecological status and none have good chemical status because water companies are currently allowed to release raw sewage into rivers and seas as part of a 'combined sewer overflow', a legacy of Britain's Victorian drainage system, The Telegraph reported.  This means rainwater and liquid waste are combined in the same tanks and overflows into waterways as an escape valve, rather than backing up into homes and streets.  Among those campaigning to clean up British waterways is former Undertones singer Feargal Sharkey, who last year announced plans to start legal action over the Environment Agency's management of England's rivers.  Last year, raw sewage was discharged into waters more than 400,000 times. Pictured: Pollution in the Jubilee River at Eton Wick, Berkshire last year  He previously said: 'As a nation, we're going to have to face a very simple situation. Do we want our rivers full of our own human waste?  Hertfordshire's River Mimram turns PURPLE with pollution, just hours after environment ministers posed in front of it to announce plans to protect and restore England's rare chalk streams River Mimram in Hertfordshire turned purple with pollution, just hours after environment ministers posed in front of it over plans to restore rare chalk streams. When environment Minister, Rebecca Pow and members of the Chalk Stream Restoration Group visited the river, it was a clear looking stream. Not long after they left, the chalk stream, that runs through North Hertfordshire from Hertford, turned a shade of purple, according to pop star and clean river campaigner Feargal Sharkey, who shared an image of the stream on Twitter. Campaigners said this highlights the dire state of Britain's rivers, where 53 per cent are in a poor state, and only 14 per cent are in 'good ecological condition.' The Environment Agency said the river had already returned to normal when it returned to investigate, and found no evidence of any harm to fish from the incident. They can't say what caused it to turn purple, but campaigners speculate it could be anything from an algae bloom to dyes seeping into water from industry. Advertisement  'The truth is, unfortunately, there's been a long term issue about failure of regulatory oversight, lack of political leadership, most of that, driven by concerns about the price of water, and now we've reached the situation through incompetence that every river is now basically full of sewage.'  In April this year, MPs were told that water companies poured raw sewage into rivers for three million hours last year, while paying shareholders billions in dividend payments.  The environmental audit committee heard that the huge Mogden treatment plant sent the equivalent of 400 Olympic swimming pools worth of raw effluent into the Thames over two days last autumn.  Sewage is allowed to be discharged only during periods of heavy rain, but Mr Sharkey told MPs the River Chess and Chesham plant in Buckinghamshire 'was discharging sewage for 35 days, one continuous discharge'.  Peter Hammond, retired former professor of computational biology at University College London, said his analysis of sewage treatment works had found 160 breaches of permits granted by the EA to allow sewage discharges.  He said the watchdog has only prosecuted 174 cases of illegal discharges in the last decade.  'My research has found that many of the treatment works do not continue to treat a minimum rate of sewage when they are spilling and many of these illegal spills are not identified by the EA,' Hammond told MPs on the environmental audit committee.  'My research found 160 breaches of permits in 2020. I believe they are in order of magnitude that I think is 10 times more … than the agency have identified.'  The EA revealed there were 403,171 spills of sewage leaked into England's rivers and seas in 2020 due to 'storm overflows'. It also said that there were more than 3.1 million hours of spillages in 2020.  The data was published 'proactively' for the first time as part of a pledge to increase transparency around the issue.",true/false
119,"The U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps on Wednesday convicted and sentenced Hunter Biden to death after 6 women appeared via ZOOM to testify how Biden and his handlers had lured them into no-escape situations where they were drugged, raped, and threatened to remain silent “or else.”  The first, a woman identified only as “Ashley,” recounted a disturbing tale about how her parents had introduced her to Hunter Biden at a 2016 diplomatic function in Washington, D.C. She was 15 at the time of the encounter.  “My parents were political donors and got invites to events. That man…Hunter Biden was at one of them. I was with my parents and their friends when he came over to say hello. He gave off creepy vibes to me right away…I was about to excuse myself to grab a soda when Hunter said he’d get it for me. I started to say ‘no thank you,’ but he was already walking toward the bar…or whatever it was. As he handed me the drink, he brushed a finger over mine and it sent chills down my spine. I shouldn’t have drank the drink. I felt lightheaded and my legs felt rubbery. Everything went blurry. And next thing I know he is holding my hand, leading me up a staircase.”  Rear Adm. Crandall and the 3-officer panel sat in silent contemplation as Ashely relived the horrid event in her mind. Handcuffed and seated across from them, Hunter Biden glanced away from the screen on which Ashley, tears welling in her eyes, continued her story.  “It was like my parents had just vanished. My body literally went numb and my speech was slurred. Next I’m on a bed, and he’s looming over me undressing himself and then…me. Everything was fuzzy but it was him. And then he put a camera on a tripod and got into the bed with me…and raped me, vaginally and anally.”  Rear Adm. Crandall asked her if she saw the villain in the tribunal chamber. She pointed directly at Hunter Biden and said, “Him.”  He then set a laptop on the prosecution table and told the officers they would bare witness to Hunter Biden’s crimes shown on a grotesque video, although everything except Hunter and Ashely’s faces had been blurred. The video showed a naked Hunter Biden flopping around atop a top a young girl whose face was identical to Ashely’s. She seemed spaced out, crying “stop, stop, stop” as Biden repeatedly raped her.  “We obtained this video from one of Biden’s devices. Ashley, is this you in this video. I know it’s difficult to see,” Rear Adm. Crandall said.  “Yes,” she muttered.  Hunter Biden objected: “May I pose a question? Is this tribunal expected to believe I whisked this girl away, drugged her, and did these things—when she was accompanied by her parents? This video is fabricated, false.”  “When I came to and realized what had happened and told my parents, they called me a liar, too,” Ashley said. “They told me it never happened. That it must have been a nightmare. I no longer speak to them.”  Five more young women appeared on Zoom to tell eerily related stories, and the 3-officer panel had to suffer through video snippets of Hunter Biden’s assault on each of them. Biden made vain and ineffective attempts at refuting their testimony and the veracity of the videos, but the tribunal didn’t give any credibility to his rebuttals. The last girl to testify claimed that Hunter and his father raped her together, but the video only showed Hunter, not Joe.  Regardless, the tribunal reached a swift decision, finding Hunter Biden guilty on all charges and recommending he receive the death sentence for his crimes. Rear Adm. Crandall agreed, and he scheduled Hunter’s hanging for October 15.  (Visited 148,505 times, 11 visits today)",true/false
120,"Rep. Leon Young figures the Wisconsin Legislature already works just part-time. So maybe it should get paid that way. Earlier this week, Young, D-Milwaukee, floated the idea of a constitutional amendment calling for lawmakers to meet just the first three months of the year and cut their pay by 75 percent — to $12,000 a year from the current $49,943. ""After reviewing the number of days that we were in session during the course of the 2011-12 biennium, I realized that we met a total of only 34 days out of a possible 122 session days,"" Young said. ""It is fair to say that we actually function as a 'de facto' part-time legislature now."" When you look only at the number of session days in 2012, Young said, the number drops to seven. ""Who works seven days and gets paid for a whole year?"" he asked. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, Wisconsin is among 10 states where the salaries are highest, there are large staffs and ""legislators are paid enough to make a living without requiring outside income."" A similar proposal to cut the pay and budget of the Milwaukee County Board has been introduced and is gaining support among some Republicans, who control both houses of the Legislature. That measure, being floated by state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, and Rep. Joe Sanfelippo, R-West Allis, would allow voters to decide whether to cut supervisors' pay to $15,000 a year from the current $51,000, eliminate health and pension benefits and make deep cuts in the board's $6.5 million annual budget. It will be interesting to see whether lawmakers view a part-time Legislature with the same enthusiasm as a part-time Milwaukee County Board. Young said he's gotten a ""couple of calls"" from fellow lawmakers in recent days, ""some in support; some not too happy, actually."" Rough times for Democracy Campaign The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, one of the state's strongest voices for government transparency, has hit a rough patch. Over the holidays, the Madison-based group was informed it would soon lose funding from the Joyce Foundation, which had supported the nonprofit for 16 years. Executive Director Mike McCabe said he is working to generate new sources of revenue to replace the $232,000 in lost Joyce funding. The Democracy Campaign's annual budget is $430,000 a year. McCabe said his highest priority is maintaining the group's searchable database that tracks donations to state candidates and associated research — which costs roughly $130,000 a year. ""We want to at least maintain our tracking program and searchable database and maintain the capacity to do research and analysis to connect the dots between all that (campaign) money and the votes at the Capitol,"" McCabe said. Some speculate that McCabe's often pointed critique of officials has generated more enemies than friends for the Democracy Campaign. ""I make no apologies for advocating for a system that values people over money,"" he said. ""I am bound and determined to keep this going."" If he fails, McCabe said, ""There will probably be some Capitol insiders that would be very happy.""",true/false
121,"An NIH whistleblower privy to a telephone Thursday morning telephone call between the corrupt administration and members of the Biden-⁠Harris Administration COVID-⁠19 Health Equity Task Force told Real Raw News that an enraged Kamala Harris called unvaccinated Americans “very dirty Trump people” after CDC Director Rochelle Walensky admitted to the difficulty of vaccinating every American citizen.  Also on the call were NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins—a vaccine pusher who Fox News’ Bret Bair has called “an American hero”—administration Communication Director Kim Bedingfield, Secretary of Health & Human Services Director Xavier Becerra, and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, a self-admitted Communist.  The 25-minute call began with Harris bemoaning “Trump supporters refusing to get vaccinated” and blaming the alleged spread the of Delta and now Omicron Covid-19 variants on Donald J. Trump and his “gang of dirty people.”  Harris launched a sprawling, breathless rant, assailing Trump with every vile name under the sun, and audaciously saying that Hillary Clinton, had she “assumed her rightful place in the White House in 2016,” would have stopped Covid-19 in its tracks before it reached American soil.  “Donald Trump soiled this country, and it’s our responsibility to correct the path. Covid is Trump’s fault; we must press that hard. We must keep him from going into the 2024 primaries. We have other people working other attack angles, but we cannot let Biden or me take blame for even a single fatality. It all started under Trump, so it’s his fault, and it’s his filthy people who, like rats, are spreading this pestilence. That’s the narrative we’re aiming for. We have Dr. Fauci on our side, and most Americans will believe whatever he says,” Harris purportedly said.  Her spurious tirade, our source said, induced a standing ovation, with Collins, Walensky, and Mayorkas pledging to commit their resources to “obliterate” Trump’s chances of returning to the Oval Office. She spent more time blasting Trump than she did discussing ways of mitigating the alleged Omicron variant, which is purely fictional, doctors have told RRN.  No person on the call, our source said, admitted to the Omicron fraud, as they chose their words meticulously. But they indirectly confessed their maleficence by linking the imaginary sickness to supporters of Donald Trump.  “It doesn’t matter if people get sick or not—everyone needs quarterly booster shots. They benefit everyone. If people support Donald Trump, we’re not getting all the shots in the arms that we have to get,” CDC Director Walensky said on the call.  “The unvaccinated are a threat to homeland security,” Mayorkas said. “DHS will keep helping the CDC monitoring the unvaccinated.”  “Trump’s supporters are the problem; they’re dirty,” Kim Bedingfield agreed.  “I wish they’d all just go away,” Harris replied. “They’re all unvaccinated January 6thers waiting to happen.”  In closing, Harris’ plummeting popularity, even among Deep Staters, seems to have earned the Border Czar and chief official of the Covid-19 task force a new responsibility: reigniting liberal hatred of Donald Trump by inventing things for which he was never responsible.

123,"The disreputable, faux Biden administration and its media cohorts have perpetrated yet another fallacy on the American public by claiming that Colin Powell died of “Covid-19 complications” despite being fully vaccinated. Although breakthrough infections that result in death are becoming more common and broadly reported by alternative media, Colin Powell had never received a positive Covid-19 diagnosis or displayed symptoms commonly associated with the China virus, said an administration whistleblower speaking under promise of anonymity.  The administration and the media have released scant details on his death, obfuscating both where he died and the approximate time of death, but were quick to blame his demise on Covid-19.  Powell, who had suffered from multiple myeloma, a blood cancer, committed suicide early Monday morning, our source said.  “Powell died at home after consuming a bottle of prescription sleeping pills,” he said.  According to him, Powell’s wife Alma awoke at 3:00 a.m. and noticed that her husband was not breathing. She discovered an empty bottle of Ambien, which had been nearly full the night previous, tucked amid the bedsheets.  “Alma called 911. She said the bottle was almost full because Colin had filled it only a few days ago. 911 routed the Call directly to the White House, which has never been heard of. No paramedics, no ambulances showed up at his McClean, Virginia, home—only the FBI,” our source said.  Two FBI Special Agents and an agency forensic pathologist arrived at the Powell’s residence shortly after 4:00 a.m. They found Mrs. Powell in a state of hysteria, screaming and crying at the top her lungs as she hovered over late husband’s corpse. After a thorough examination of the bedroom, one agent found what appeared to be a suicide note on the floor beside the Powell’s bed.  “I’ll love you always, Alma, you and the children. But I am old and sick, and I know they’ll find me soon, like they have the others. I don’t want my legacy to end that way. I pray you can all forgive me, for what I’ve done, and now what I no longer have to do. The man in the glass tower must not rise. I place myself in the Lord’s hands; I’d rather He judge me than them,” part of the note purportedly read.  Powell, who had identified as a Republican, was a RINO—Republican in name only. He was an outspoken opponent of Donald J. Trump, and he had endorsed both Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden’s bids for the presidency.  “The FBI made a call directly to Kamala Harris, and she told them they’d have to spin the death to make it appear as if he died from Covid,” our source said. “The FBI is a tool of the Deep State.”  The administration and the CDC have been instructing health institutions and city and county coroners to falsify death certificates to make it seem as if every human fatality over the last two years was a result of Covid-19.

124,"Last month Real Raw News reported on a shocking incident at the Pentagon, the seat of America’s military might: The man who calls himself president, Joseph R. Biden, had visited the Pentagon under the pretense of conducting a surprise presidential inspection. His real impetus was to learn whether a rumor he had heard was true, that Donald J. Trump was in the building meeting secretly with Marine Corps General David H. Berger, which could explain why Pentagon police denied him access to the property. While RRN cannot confirm Trump’s presence, we can now authenticate earlier reports that pointed to a dramatic shift in power at the nation’s most fortified structure.  On April 14, two days before the Pentagon Protection Force turned away a shocked and confused Biden, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley summoned the 7 other Joint Chiefs to the Pentagon for an emergency meeting, according to a confidential source involved in Trump’s mission to eliminate Deep State operatives throughout the nation.  Gen. Milley, our source said, lambasted his colleagues for allowing high-ranking officers from all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces to undermine Biden’s presidency. Gen. Milley said Biden was the democratically elected President of the United States, and that all armed forces personnel, from the lowest private to the highest general, had a patriotic duty to support and protect Democracy, Joseph Biden, and Kamala Harris.  “From what we know, he went off, ballistic-like. He was a cursing machine, swearing at and excoriating these highly decorated, lifelong members of our country’s military. He said he’d heard they were helping Trump do what he called ‘secret and illegal arrests’ of prominent active and retired politicians. He kept blasting them and told them he was going to recommend that Biden and Harris fire them,” our source said.  Gen. Milley reportedly offered the other Joint Chiefs of Staff a final chance to abandon their allegiance to Donald J. Trump and swear fealty to Joseph R. Biden and Kamala Harris.  Of all the Chiefs, only one leapt to his feet in support of Biden. Gen. Daniel R. Hokanson, Chief of the National Guard Bureau, denounced Donald Trump and told Gen. Milley that he and the National Guard would honor their oath to the Constitution He said they were prepared to defend Biden’s presidency with their lives, if necessary.  Our source said Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps David H. Berger, a longtime supporter of Donald Trump, passed Gen. Milley an envelope. The envelope held an arrest warrant issued by the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps. It named Gen. Milley as a traitor to America and its people.  “Except for you and this coward,” Gen. Berger said, pointing at Gen. Hokanson, “we all support this great nation and what it stands for, and we reject the forces of darkness destroying what our Founding Fathers worked so hard to codify. We stand for a nation, not a man. Why are you so eager to say Kamala Harris’s name in every sentence with Biden’s name? We know why.”  Gen. Milley, our source added, shredded the warrant, calling it a joke, and promised Gen. Berger he would hang for treasonous behavior.  “If anyone hangs, it won’t be me,” Gen. Berger reportedly said. “We’ve been expecting this for a long time.”  A dozen armed members of the Pentagon Protection Force entered the conference room and handcuffed Generals Milley and Hokanson.  In closing, our source said Milley and Hokanson have since been shipped to Guantanamo Bay, where they will ultimately answer to a military tribunal.  Asked if Donald J. Trump was at the Pentagon on April 16, our source replied: “I cannot say yes or not. I can tell that what’s happening now is a prelude to his reinauguration on Independence Day.”  (Visited 2 times, 2 visits today)",true/false
125,"The chant “lock her up” has finally seen fruition.  US Navy SEALS loyal to Donald Trump raided Hillary Clinton’s Chappaqua, NY estate and arrested her on charges of treason, destruction of government property, and aiding and abetting the enemy, Real Raw News has learned.  The arrest happened on Tuesday night, according to a source in Trump’s orbit, only hours after Trump had spoken to Rear Admiral Hugh W. Howard at US Special Operations Command and given him a “mammoth trove” of evidence of Clinton’s criminality dating back to her days at the State Department. The evidence allegedly includes thousands of never-before-seen emails, which Clinton acid washed prior to the 2016 presidential election, as well as documents implicating her in plots to assassinate Republican legislators across the country.  The evidence was so compelling, our source added, that Adm. Howard had trouble believing that Clinton wasn’t arrested years ago.  “Trump’s been wanting to get her, and the rest of the Deep State cabal, ever since he set foot in the White House. It has taken him years to dig up the motherload. Once he had military support, he greenlit the operation. Trump’s team, for lack of a better word, had been surveilling Clinton a long time, and he knew she was always alone on Tuesday nights. That’s when the SEALS nabbed her,” our source said.  Under cover of darkness, an eight-man detachment from Naval Special Warfare Group 3 infiltrated the Chappaqua mansion shortly after 2:00am. Mysteriously, Clinton’s two-man Secret Service detail, which normally lives in a guest house on the property, was absent that morning. The SEALS cleared the main building, then silently breached the door to her bedroom, where they found her awake rehearsing a speech before a vanity mirror. They fired a single tranquilizer dart into her neck, our source said, before taping her mouth and sealing a black cloth bag over her head.  The SEALS also seized several laptops and reams of paper, our source said.  “I don’t know where they took her; only Trump knows that. But this is proof that Trump and the military have started taking out the cabal. It took him longer than expected, longer than he wanted, but better late than never. Trump is doing what’s right for America,” our source said.  Trump will soon send her to Guantanamo Bay to face a military tribunal for her crimes against America and its people. GITMO, our source said in closing, is run by the Marine Corps. and the US Navy, both of which have forsaken Joe Biden and instead pledged to help Donald Trump vanquish the forces of darkness that have enshrouded the nation in corruption for decades.

127,"Last month Real Raw News reported on a shocking incident at the Pentagon, the seat of America’s military might: The man who calls himself president, Joseph R. Biden, had visited the Pentagon under the pretense of conducting a surprise presidential inspection. His real impetus was to learn whether a rumor he had heard was true, that Donald J. Trump was in the building meeting secretly with Marine Corps General David H. Berger, which could explain why Pentagon police denied him access to the property. While RRN cannot confirm Trump’s presence, we can now authenticate earlier reports that pointed to a dramatic shift in power at the nation’s most fortified structure.  On April 14, two days before the Pentagon Protection Force turned away a shocked and confused Biden, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley summoned the 7 other Joint Chiefs to the Pentagon for an emergency meeting, according to a confidential source involved in Trump’s mission to eliminate Deep State operatives throughout the nation.  Gen. Milley, our source said, lambasted his colleagues for allowing high-ranking officers from all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces to undermine Biden’s presidency. Gen. Milley said Biden was the democratically elected President of the United States, and that all armed forces personnel, from the lowest private to the highest general, had a patriotic duty to support and protect Democracy, Joseph Biden, and Kamala Harris.  “From what we know, he went off, ballistic-like.

128,"By Peter Andrews , Irish science journalist and writer based in London. He has a background in the life sciences, and graduated from the University of Glasgow with a degree in genetics  It has been revealed that the standard tests being used in the US to diagnose Covid-19 cases are far too sensitive, with the vast majority of people marked down as being positive actually turning out to be negative.  Top US virologists have been stunned by revelations about the laxity of the US Covid testing regimen. It turns out that tests that deliver a simple binary “positive or negative” result are not fit for purpose, as they tell us nothing about the contagiousness of each person.  Data from three US states – New York, Nevada and Massachusetts – shows that when the amount of the virus found in a person is taken into account, up to 90 percent of people who have tested positive should actually have been negative, as they are carrying only tiny amounts of the virus, are not contagious, pose no risk to others, and have no need to isolate.  This means that only a fraction of the daily “cases” being reported so hysterically in the mainstream media are actual, bona fide Covid-19 sufferers, and need treatment and to separate themselves from others.  Also on rt.com White House rejects ‘corrupt’ WHO concerns over Covid-19 vaccine development  It’s a sensitive issue  So how could this have happened? The answer has to do with the sensitivity of PCR Polymerase chain reaction tests for Covid, which it turns out can be ramped up according to the taste of the testing companies. Most testing companies have chosen the outrageously high sensitivity limit of 40 PCR cycles – meaning that the DNA in a sample is exponentially increased 40 times in order to amplify its signal.  Read more  But using such a ridiculously sensitive test means that the faintest traces of a dead virus, or even leftovers from previous infections, can result in a positive. Professor Juliet Morrison, a University of California virologist, said that even a limit of 35 PCR cycles is too high, let alone 40. She said she was “shocked that people would think that 40 could represent a positive.” But apparently, pretty much everyone in the US Covid brain trust took exactly that on faith.  So the scale of the pandemic ‘problem’ is actually much smaller than we’ve been led to believe – about a tenth of what all the politicians and media have been using to justify the lockdowns, the quarantines, the mass testing. Some may be shocked that the scale of the problem is so much smaller than assumed. But for a seasoned ignorer of any and all statistics that contain Covid ‘cases’, there are no surprises here. The truth is, there was never any reason to be confident in such figures. The FDA has only now been forced to concede that they have no idea how different testing companies determine which the positive and negative tests are: they just accept whatever data they are given.  What these findings bring is absolute assurance that the testing to this point has been an utter waste of time, and that not one statistic concerning this pandemic – from cases to deaths to infection rates – can be believed. But it should not have taken some journalist to ask the right question to discover this: a bit of common sense would have been enough. What is it going to take for these professional virologists to drop their assumptions and models, and just start acting based on the facts at hand?  Also on rt.com We might have to wait forever for science to show the Covid threat is over, so let’s use our common sense & get back to normal  Scrap test and trace  It’s a virus so deadly, you need a test to tell whether you have it or not. So goes the refrain of many lockdown skeptics, Covidiots and anti-maskers, of whom I am an indignant supporter. Something has gone… not just wrong, but totally haywire... when the might of the world’s scientific establishment is trained with the zeal of a Witchfinder General on one particular microscopic particle. Not even a particularly dangerous particle; the latest data show it is the eighth most common cause of death in England, and it doesn’t make the top ten in Wales.  Meanwhile, in Wuhan, the original source of this disease, the pool parties are in full swing. They don’t seem to be too worried about PCR tests or contact tracing, or even the virus itself. The Chinese government says that their supreme lockdown was so awesome that they now have zero Covid: a biological impossibility. Maybe they just stopped testing, and decided to get on with their lives. Everyone else should take a leaf out of their book.  Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!",true/false
129,"Do you support Trump YES NO Created with  The man who gave us “The Fall Guy”, “The Six Million Dollar Man” and countless other television and movie roles has left us after complications from a Penuma surgical procedure ended his life. He died peacefully while under anesthesia on the operating table, at the full age of 80.  Majors was best known for his casting as Steve Austin in the popular 70’s television crime drama “The Six Million Dollar Man,” about an accident victim who receives robotic body parts to give him super speed, strength, hearing, and vision. The popularity of this show launched the rest of his very successful career.  Who should become president of USA in 2020? Donald Trump Any other but not trump Create Online  But Majors’ life wasn’t just about acting. He was also a devoted Christian, who supported many religious charities, and a lifelong member of the Republican Party. He never swayed from his support of the GOP, saying that the party’s values were “in line with his own in regard to God, family, religion, and wealth. Republicans are the party Jesus would vote for.”  This loyalty explains the beneficiaries of his last will and testament, namely, his own church as well as the campaign to re-elect President Trump. Majors left 66% of his sizeable $9 million estate to Trump 2020 – a symbolic total of $6 million. An excerpt from his will showed his love for our President:  “President Trump has shown the leadership and strength that this country has lacked for decades. My contribution will go to him but will really be for America. The amount is bionic. I hope it gives the USA power. I know Steve Austin would approve.”  Thank you Lee. RIP",true/false
130,"A new report from Italy’s Higher Institute of Health provides an objective analysis of the nation’s misleading covid-19 death tally. Italy’s official covid death tally rose to 132,161 in October of 2021. This tally is unrealistic because covid-19 was diagnosed in haste and under conditions of financial bribery using non-specific diagnostic criteria.  Covid-19 was often listed as the cause of death when it was merely “suspected” and when “it could not be ruled out.”  After careful review of the medical reports, it turns out that respiratory infections may have been a contributing factor but did not cause most of these covid-19 deaths outright.  Various forms of medical malpractice, withheld treatment, inhumane isolation, undernourishment, and unethical standards of care are at the root of this worldwide medical crisis. The deaths are real, but the causes are skewed.  New medical analysis reduces Italy’s covid-19 death tally by 97.1%  A new analysis reduced Italy’s covid-19 death tally by 97.1 percent and provided a more accurate picture as to why these people died in the hospital. Only 3,783 cases could be directly correlated with a covid-19 diagnosis. Because the PCR test (that was designed to detect covid-19) was fraudulently-calibrated from the start, even these 3,783 cases of covid-19 are suspect.  Symptoms of respiratory infection could have been the result of any number of infections that kill people every year, whether that be influenza, tuberculosis, pneumonia or countless other lower and upper respiratory tract infections. Viral infections do not have the same effect on one person to the next due to several underlying factors including the cellular and microbiome terrain, so it is extremely difficult to accurately diagnose a specific respiratory infection and quantify viral load.  According to this new analysis, only 2.9% of the deaths registered since the end of February 2020 have been caused by the novel SARS coronavirus that has never been isolated from humans and replicated in human tissue samples. The annual respiratory infections, antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, medical errors and other acute medical emergencies that usually cause overcrowding in hospitals were used as propaganda to terrorize and defraud the world into perpetual lock down.  The covid-19 death tally included Italians who suffered from one to five underlying chronic diseases; many were on immune suppressant drugs, and a certain percentage died from medical emergencies that are totally unrelated to covid-19. A total of 67.7% suffered from more than three chronic diseases that had not been resolved through modern medicine. Italians who were already suffering from chronic conditions went on to suffer further from ventilator-associated pneumonia and ventilator-associated lung damage.  One in ten of the deceased patients had a stroke; 65.8% of the Italians had arterial hypertension and were on immune-suppressant drugs; 15.7% suffered from heart failure; 28% had ischemic heart disease; and 24.8% suffered from atrial fibrillation. At least 17.4% already had sick lungs. Many (29.3% had diabetes and other metabolic ailments) that drastically impacted their immune response.  There were several patients (16.3%) who were on their deathbed, struggling on immunosuppressant chemotherapy and radiation drugs known to make people susceptible to any respiratory infection.  These cancer patients had been dealing with cancer for the past five years, with an average three-to-five-year chemotherapy survival rate coming to a close. Another 23.5% were struggling with dementia, their life coming to a close.  Unethical, inhumane practices have been implemented in medical systems worldwide  Ever since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a worldwide pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, medical systems around the world have handled hospitalized patients differently. Patients with any sort of respiratory symptom were isolated and separated from family members.  “Out of an abundance of caution,” hospital systems made vague diagnoses, classifying anyone “suspected of covid” as an official case of SARS-CoV-2. These patients were viewed as highly contagious vectors of disease that should be isolated and put on mechanical ventilation.  Efficacious treatments were bypassed. People dying on ventilators were classified as covid deaths “when covid-19 could not be ruled out as the primary cause of their death.”  As terror and fear were propagated across the media, hospital systems put non-urgent, elective procedures on hold, suspending routine outpatient services that left many chronic patients without adequate medical care.  Industrialized nations like Italy did not implement at-home treatment plans and did not distribute nutraceuticals and prophylactics to help control respiratory disease in the population. This caused populations to be dependent on an already overcrowded system that is not set up to deal with panic, ignorance and helplessness.  As nations continue to put all their stock in retrovirus-contaminated influenza vaccines and experimental gene interference coronavirus vaccines, people continue to suffer and die, even as countless anti-viral, bronco-dilating, anti-inflammatory immune therapies exist.

131,"He was not speaking about heaven or where we or they will go, he said, and this is the most important thing which was overlooked by many, that as far as Russia’s doctrine is concerned, Russia reserves no right to preemptive strike. It other words, our doctrine provides for no right to preemptive strike, Peskov stressed, adding that Russia reserves the right to a nuclear strike only in case it is attacked with the use of nuclear weapons or attacked in a way that jeopardizes the mere existence of the state. It means we will never be the first to attack anyone. This is what the president said. But if we come under attack, then everyone will go where he or she should - either to heaven or to hell, or elsewhere. This is what he meant, the rest was allegory, he said. In his speech at a session of the Valdai International Discussion Club last Thursday, Putin said, among other things, that Russia’s concept is retaliation against the aggressor. An aggressor must know that retaliation is inevitable and it will be destroyed. And we, the victims of the aggression, we like martyrs will get into the heaven while they will simply die immediately because they will even have no time to repent, Putin said.",true/false
132,"Though the whole world relies on RT-PCR to “diagnose” Sars-Cov-2 infection, the science is clear: they are not fit for purpose  Torsten Engelbrecht and Konstantin Demeter  Lockdowns and hygienic measures around the world are based on numbers of cases and mortality rates created by the so-called SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests used to identify “positive” patients, whereby “positive” is usually equated with “infected.”  But looking closely at the facts, the conclusion is that these PCR tests are meaningless as a diagnostic tool to determine an alleged infection by a supposedly new virus called SARS-CoV-2.  Unfounded “Test, test, test,…” mantra  At the media briefing on COVID-19 on March 16, 2020, the WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said:  We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test.”  The message was spread through headlines around the world, for instance by Reuters and the BBC.  Still on the 3 of May, the moderator of the heute journal — one of the most important news magazines on German television— was passing the mantra of the corona dogma on to his audience with the admonishing words:  Test, test, test—that is the credo at the moment, and it is the only way to really understand how much the coronavirus is spreading.”  This indicates that the belief in the validity of the PCR tests is so strong that it equals a religion that tolerates virtually no contradiction.  But it is well known that religions are about faith and not about scientific facts. And as Walter Lippmann, the two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and perhaps the most influential journalist of the 20th century said: “Where all think alike, no one thinks very much.”  So to start, it is very remarkable that Kary Mullis himself, the inventor of the Polymerase Chain Reaction PCR technology, did not think alike. His invention got him the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1993.  Unfortunately, Mullis passed away last year at the age of 74, but there is no doubt that the biochemist regarded the PCR as inappropriate to detect a viral infection.  The reason is that the intended use of the PCR was, and still is, to apply it as a manufacturing technique, being able to replicate DNA sequences millions and billions of times, and not as a diagnostic tool to detect viruses.  How declaring virus pandemics based on PCR tests can end in disaster was described by Gina Kolata in her 2007 New York Times article Faith in Quick Test Leads to Epidemic That Wasn’t.  Lack of a valid gold standard  Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the PCR tests used to identify so-called COVID-19 patients presumably infected by what is called SARS-CoV-2 do not have a valid gold standard to compare them with.  This is a fundamental point. Tests need to be evaluated to determine their preciseness — strictly speaking their “sensitivity”[1] and “specificity” — by comparison with a “gold standard,” meaning the most accurate method available.  As an example, for a pregnancy test the gold standard would be the pregnancy itself. But as Australian infectious diseases specialist Sanjaya Senanayake, for example, stated in an ABC TV interview in an answer to the question “How accurate is the [COVID-19] testing?”:  If we had a new test for picking up [the bacterium] golden staph in blood, we’ve already got blood cultures, that’s our gold standard we’ve been using for decades, and we could match this new test against that. But for COVID-19 we don’t have a gold standard test.”  Jessica C. Watson from Bristol University confirms this. In her paper “Interpreting a COVID-19 test result”, published recently in The British Medical Journal, she writes that there is a “lack of such a clear-cut ‘gold-standard’ for COVID-19 testing.”  But instead of classifying the tests as unsuitable for SARS-CoV-2 detection and COVID-19 diagnosis, or instead of pointing out that only a virus, proven through isolation and purification, can be a solid gold standard, Watson claims in all seriousness that, “pragmatically” COVID-19 diagnosis itself, remarkably including PCR testing itself, “may be the best available ‘gold standard’.” But this is not scientifically sound.  Apart from the fact that it is downright absurd to take the PCR test itself as part of the gold standard to evaluate the PCR test, there are no distinctive specific symptoms for COVID-19, as even people such as Thomas Löscher, former head of the Department of Infection and Tropical Medicine at the University of Munich and member of the Federal Association of German Internists, conceded to us[2].  And if there are no distinctive specific symptoms for COVID-19, COVID-19 diagnosis — contrary to Watson’s statement — cannot be suitable for serving as a valid gold standard.  In addition, “experts” such as Watson overlook the fact that only virus isolation, i.e. an unequivocal virus proof, can be the gold standard.  That is why I asked Watson how COVID-19 diagnosis “may be the best available gold standard,” if there are no distinctive specific symptoms for COVID-19, and also whether the virus itself, that is virus isolation, wouldn’t be the best available/possible gold standard. But she hasn’t answered these questions yet – despite multiple requests. And she has not yet responded to our rapid response post on her article in which we address exactly the same points, either, though she wrote us on June 2nd: “I will try to post a reply later this week when I have a chance.”  No proof for the RNA being of viral origin  Now the question is: What is required first for virus isolation/proof? We need to know where the RNA for which the PCR tests are calibrated comes from.  As textbooks e.g., White/Fenner. Medical Virology, 1986, p. 9 as well as leading virus researchers such as Luc Montagnier or Dominic Dwyer state, particle purification — i.e. the separation of an object from everything else that is not that object, as for instance Nobel laureate Marie Curie purified 100 mg of radium chloride in 1898 by extracting it from tons of pitchblende — is an essential pre-requisite for proving the existence of a virus, and thus to prove that the RNA from the particle in question comes from a new virus.  The reason for this is that PCR is extremely sensitive, which means it can detect even the smallest pieces of DNA or RNA — but it cannot determine where these particles came from. That has to be determined beforehand.  And because the PCR tests are calibrated for gene sequences in this case RNA sequences because SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be a RNA virus, we have to know that these gene snippets are part of the looked-for virus. And to know that, correct isolation and purification of the presumed virus has to be executed.  Hence, we have asked the science teams of the relevant papers which are referred to in the context of SARS-CoV-2 for proof whether the electron-microscopic shots depicted in their in vitro experiments show purified viruses.  But not a single team could answer that question with “yes” — and NB., nobody said purification was not a necessary step. We only got answers like “No, we did not obtain an electron micrograph showing the degree of purification” see below.  We asked several study authors “Do your electron micrographs show the purified virus?”, they gave the following responses:  Study 1: Leo L. M. Poon; Malik Peiris. “Emergence of a novel human coronavirus threatening human health” Nature Medicine, March 2020  Replying Author: Malik Peiris  Date: May 12, 2020  Answer: “The image is the virus budding from an infected cell. It is not purified virus.” Study 2: Myung-Guk Han et al. “Identification of Coronavirus Isolated from a Patient in Korea with COVID-19”, Osong Public Health and Research Perspectives, February 2020  Replying Author: Myung-Guk Han  Date: May 6, 2020  Answer: “We could not estimate the degree of purification because we do not purify and concentrate the virus cultured in cells.” Study 3: Wan Beom Park et al. “Virus Isolation from the First Patient with SARS-CoV-2 in Korea”, Journal of Korean Medical Science, February 24, 2020  Replying Author: Wan Beom Park  Date: March 19, 2020  Answer: “We did not obtain an electron micrograph showing the degree of purification.” Study 4: Na Zhu et al., “A Novel Coronavirus from Patients with Pneumonia in China”, 2019, New England Journal of Medicine, February 20, 2020  Replying Author: Wenjie Tan  Date: March 18, 2020  Answer: “[We show] an image of sedimented virus particles, not purified ones.”  Regarding the mentioned papers it is clear that what is shown in the electron micrographs EMs is the end result of the experiment, meaning there is no other result that they could have made EMs from.  That is to say, if the authors of these studies concede that their published EMs do not show purified particles, then they definitely do not possess purified particles claimed to be viral. In this context, it has to be remarked that some researchers use the term “isolation” in their papers, but the procedures described therein do not represent a proper isolation purification process. Consequently, in this context the term “isolation” is misused.  Thus, the authors of four of the principal, early 2020 papers claiming discovery of a new coronavirus concede they had no proof that the origin of the virus genome was viral-like particles or cellular debris, pure or impure, or particles of any kind. In other words, the existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is based on faith, not fact.  We have also contacted Dr Charles Calisher, who is a seasoned virologist. In 2001, Science published an “impassioned plea…to the younger generation” from several veteran virologists, among them Calisher, saying that:  [modern virus detection methods like] sleek polymerase chain reaction […] tell little or nothing about how a virus multiplies, which animals carry it, [or] how it makes people sick. [It is] like trying to say whether somebody has bad breath by looking at his fingerprint.”[3]  And that’s why we asked Dr Calisher whether he knows one single paper in which SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated and finally really purified. His answer:  I know of no such a publication. I have kept an eye out for one.”[4]  This actually means that one cannot conclude that the RNA gene sequences, which the scientists took from the tissue samples prepared in the mentioned in vitro trials and for which the PCR tests are finally being “calibrated,” belong to a specific virus — in this case SARS-CoV-2.  In addition, there is no scientific proof that those RNA sequences are the causative agent of what is called COVID-19.  In order to establish a causal connection, one way or the other, i.e. beyond virus isolation and purification, it would have been absolutely necessary to carry out an experiment that satisfies the four Koch’s postulates. But there is no such experiment, as Amory Devereux and Rosemary Frei recently revealed for OffGuardian.  The necessity to fulfill these postulates regarding SARS-CoV-2 is demonstrated not least by the fact that attempts have been made to fulfill them. But even researchers claiming they have done it, in reality, did not succeed.  One example is a study published in Nature on May 7. This trial, besides other procedures which render the study invalid, did not meet any of the postulates.  For instance, the alleged “infected” laboratory mice did not show any relevant clinical symptoms clearly attributable to pneumonia, which according to the third postulate should actually occur if a dangerous and potentially deadly virus was really at work there. And the slight bristles and weight loss, which were observed temporarily in the animals are negligible, not only because they could have been caused by the procedure itself, but also because the weight went back to normal again.  Also, no animal died except those they killed to perform the autopsies. And let’s not forget: These experiments should have been done before developing a test, which is not the case.  Revealingly, none of the leading German representatives of the official theory about SARS-Cov-2/COVID-19 — the Robert Koch-Institute RKI, Alexander S. Kekulé University of Halle, Hartmut Hengel and Ralf Bartenschlager German Society for Virology, the aforementioned Thomas Löscher, Ulrich Dirnagl Charité Berlin or Georg Bornkamm virologist and professor emeritus at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Munich — could answer the following question I have sent them:  If the particles that are claimed to be to be SARS-CoV-2 have not been purified, how do you want to be sure that the RNA gene sequences of these particles belong to a specific new virus?  Particularly, if there are studies showing that substances such as antibiotics that are added to the test tubes in the in vitro experiments carried out for virus detection can “stress” the cell culture in a way that new gene sequences are being formed that were not previously detectable — an aspect that Nobel laureate Barbara McClintock already drew attention to in her Nobel Lecture back in 1983.  It should not go unmentioned that we finally got the Charité – the employer of Christian Drosten, Germany’s most influential virologist in respect of COVID-19, advisor to the German government and co-developer of the PCR test which was the first to be “accepted” not validated! by the WHO worldwide – to answer questions on the topic.  But we didn’t get answers until June 18, 2020, after months of non-response. In the end, we achieved it only with the help of Berlin lawyer Viviane Fischer.  Regarding our question “Has the Charité convinced itself that appropriate particle purification was carried out?,” the Charité concedes that they didn’t use purified particles.  And although they claim “virologists at the Charité are sure that they are testing for the virus,” in their paper Corman et al. they state:  RNA was extracted from clinical samples with the MagNA Pure 96 system Roche, Penzberg, Germany and from cell culture supernatants with the viral RNA mini kit QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany,”  Which means they just assumed the RNA was viral.  Incidentally, the Corman et al. paper, published on January 23, 2020 didn’t even go through a proper peer review process, nor were the procedures outlined therein accompanied by controls — although it is only through these two things that scientific work becomes really solid.  Irrational test results  It is also certain that we cannot know the false positive rate of the PCR tests without widespread testing of people who certainly do not have the virus, proven by a method which is independent of the test having a solid gold standard.  Therefore, it is hardly surprising that there are several papers illustrating irrational test results.  For example, already in February the health authority in China’s Guangdong province reported that people have fully recovered from illness blamed on COVID-19, started to test “negative,” and then tested “positive” again.  A month later, a paper published in the Journal of Medical Virology showed that 29 out of 610 patients at a hospital in Wuhan had 3 to 6 test results that flipped between “negative”, “positive” and “dubious”.  A third example is a study from Singapore in which tests were carried out almost daily on 18 patients and the majority went from “positive” to “negative” back to “positive” at least once, and up to five times in one patient.  Even Wang Chen, president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, conceded in February that the PCR tests are “only 30 to 50 per cent accurate”; while Sin Hang Lee from the Milford Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory sent a letter to the WHO’s coronavirus response team and to Anthony S. Fauci on March 22, 2020, saying that:  It has been widely reported in the social media that the RT-qPCR [Reverse Transcriptase quantitative PCR] test kits used to detect SARSCoV-2 RNA in human specimens are generating many false positive results and are not sensitive enough to detect some real positive cases.”  In other words, even if we theoretically assume that these PCR tests can really detect a viral infection, the tests would be practically worthless, and would only cause an unfounded scare among the “positive” people tested.  This becomes also evident considering the positive predictive value PPV.  The PPV indicates the probability that a person with a positive test result is truly “positive” ie. has the supposed virus, and it depends on two factors: the prevalence of the virus in the general population and the specificity of the test, that is the percentage of people without disease in whom the test is correctly “negative” a test with a specificity of 95% incorrectly gives a positive result in 5 out of 100 non-infected people.  With the same specificity, the higher the prevalence, the higher the PPV.  In this context, on June 12 2020, the journal Deutsches Ärzteblatt published an article in which the PPV has been calculated with three different prevalence scenarios.  The results must, of course, be viewed very critically, first because it is not possible to calculate the specificity without a solid gold standard, as outlined, and second because the calculations in the article are based on the specificity determined in the study by Jessica Watson, which is potentially worthless, as also mentioned.  But if you abstract from it, assuming that the underlying specificity of 95% is correct and that we know the prevalence, even the mainstream medical journal Deutsches Ärzteblatt reports that the so-called SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests may have “a shockingly low” PPV.  In one of the three scenarios, figuring with an assumed prevalence of 3%, the PPV was only 30 percent, which means that 70 percent of the people tested “positive” are not “positive” at all. Yet “they are prescribed quarantine,” as even the Ärzteblatt notes critically.  In a second scenario of the journal’s article, a prevalence of rate of 20 percent is assumed. In this case they generate a PPV of 78 percent, meaning that 22 percent of the “positive” tests are false “positives.”  That would mean: If we take the around 9 million people who are currently considered “positive” worldwide — supposing that the true “positives” really have a viral infection — we would get almost 2 million false “positives.”  All this fits with the fact that the CDC and the FDA, for instance, concede in their files that the so-called “SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests” are not suitable for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.  In the “CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel“ file from March 30, 2020, for example, it says:  Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms”  And:  This test cannot rule out diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens.”  And the FDA admits that:  positive results […] do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.”  Remarkably, in the instruction manuals of PCR tests we can also read that they are not intended as a diagnostic test, as for instance in those by Altona Diagnostics and Creative Diagnostics[5].  To quote another one, in the product announcement of the LightMix Modular Assays produced by TIB Molbiol — which were developed using the Corman et al. protocol — and distributed by Roche we can read:  These assays are not intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of coronavirus infection”  And:  For research use only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.”  Where is the evidence that the tests can measure the “viral load”?  There is also reason to conclude that the PCR test from Roche and others cannot even detect the targeted genes.  Moreover, in the product descriptions of the RT-qPCR tests for SARS-COV-2 it says they are “qualitative” tests, contrary to the fact that the “q” in “qPCR” stands for “quantitative.” And if these tests are not “quantitative” tests, they don’t show how many viral particles are in the body.  That is crucial because, in order to even begin talking about actual illness in the real world not only in a laboratory, the patient would need to have millions and millions of viral particles actively replicating in their body.  That is to say, the CDC, the WHO, the FDA or the RKI may assert that the tests can measure the so-called “viral load,” i.e. how many viral particles are in the body. “But this has never been proven. That is an enormous scandal,” as the journalist Jon Rappoport points out.  This is not only because the term “viral load” is deception. If you put the question “what is viral load?” at a dinner party, people take it to mean viruses circulating in the bloodstream. They’re surprised to learn it’s actually RNA molecules.  Also, to prove beyond any doubt that the PCR can measure how much a person is “burdened” with a disease-causing virus, the following experiment would have had to be carried out which has not yet happened:  You take, let’s say, a few hundred or even thousand people and remove tissue samples from them. Make sure the people who take the samples do not perform the test.The testers will never know who the patients are and what condition they’re in. The testers run their PCR on the tissue samples. In each case, they say which virus they found and how much of it they found. Then, for example, in patients 29, 86, 199, 272, and 293 they found a great deal of what they claim is a virus. Now we un-blind those patients. They should all be sick, because they have so much virus replicating in their bodies. But are they really sick — or are they fit as a fiddle?  With the help of the aforementioned lawyer Viviane Fischer, I finally got the Charité to also answer the question of whether the test developed by Corman et al. — the so-called “Drosten PCR test” — is a quantitative test.  But the Charité was not willing to answer this question “yes”. Instead, the Charité wrote:  If real-time RT-PCR is involved, to the knowledge of the Charité in most cases these are […] limited to qualitative detection.”  Furthermore, the “Drosten PCR test” uses the unspecific E-gene assay as preliminary assay, while the Institut Pasteur uses the same assay as confirmatory assay.  According to Corman et al., the E-gene assay is likely to detect all Asian viruses, while the other assays in both tests are supposed to be more specific for sequences labelled “SARS-CoV-2”.  Besides the questionable purpose of having either a preliminary or a confirmatory test that is likely to detect all Asian viruses, at the beginning of April the WHO changed the algorithm, recommending that from then on a test can be regarded as “positive” even if just the E-gene assay which is likely to detect all Asian viruses! gives a “positive” result.  This means that a confirmed unspecific test result is officially sold as specific.  That change of algorithm increased the “case” numbers. Tests using the E-gene assay are produced for example by Roche, TIB Molbiol and R-Biopharm.  High Cq values make the test results even more meaningless  Another essential problem is that many PCR tests have a “cycle quantification” Cq value of over 35, and some, including the “Drosten PCR test”, even have a Cq of 45.  The Cq value specifies how many cycles of DNA replication are required to detect a real signal from biological samples.  “Cq values higher than 40 are suspect because of the implied low efficiency and generally should not be reported,” as it says in the MIQE guidelines.  MIQE stands for “Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments”, a set of guidelines that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating publications on Real-Time PCR, also called quantitative PCR, or qPCR.  The inventor himself, Kary Mullis, agreed, when he stated:  If you have to go more than 40 cycles to amplify a single-copy gene, there is something seriously wrong with your PCR.”  The MIQE guidelines have been developed under the aegis of Stephen A. Bustin, Professor of Molecular Medicine, a world-renowned expert on quantitative PCR and author of the book A-Z of Quantitative PCR which has been called “the bible of qPCR.”  In a recent podcast interview Bustin points out that “the use of such arbitrary Cq cut-offs is not ideal, because they may be either too low eliminating valid results or too high increasing false “positive” results.”  And, according to him, a Cq in the 20s to 30s should be aimed at and there is concern regarding the reliability of the results for any Cq over 35.  If the Cq value gets too high, it becomes difficult to distinguish real signal from background, for example due to reactions of primers and fluorescent probes, and hence there is a higher probability of false positives.  Moreover, among other factors that can alter the result, before starting with the actual PCR, in case you are looking for presumed RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, the RNA must be converted to complementary DNA cDNA with the enzyme Reverse Transcriptase—hence the “RT” at the beginning of “PCR” or “qPCR.”  But this transformation process is “widely recognized as inefficient and variable,” as Jessica Schwaber from the Centre for Commercialization of Regenerative Medicine in Toronto and two research colleagues pointed out in a 2019 paper.  Stephen A. Bustin acknowledges problems with PCR in a comparable way.  For example, he pointed to the problem that in the course of the conversion process RNA to cDNA the amount of DNA obtained with the same RNA base material can vary widely, even by a factor of 10 see above interview.  Considering that the DNA sequences get doubled at every cycle, even a slight variation becomes magnified and can thus alter the result, annihilating the test’s reliable informative value.  So how can it be that those who claim the PCR tests are highly meaningful for so-called COVID-19 diagnosis blind out the fundamental inadequacies of these tests—even if they are confronted with questions regarding their validity?  Certainly, the apologists of the novel coronavirus hypothesis should have dealt with these questions before throwing the tests on the market and putting basically the whole world under lockdown, not least because these are questions that come to mind immediately for anyone with even a spark of scientific understanding.  Thus, the thought inevitably emerges that financial and political interests play a decisive role for this ignorance about scientific obligations. NB, the WHO, for example has financial ties with drug companies, as the British Medical Journal showed in 2010.  And experts criticize “that the notorious corruption and conflicts of interest at WHO have continued, even grown“ since then. The CDC as well, to take another big player, is obviously no better off.  Finally, the reasons and possible motives remain speculative, and many involved surely act in good faith; but the science is clear: The numbers generated by these RT-PCR tests do not in the least justify frightening people who have been tested “positive” and imposing lockdown measures that plunge countless people into poverty and despair or even drive them to suicide.  And a “positive” result may have serious consequences for the patients as well, because then all non-viral factors are excluded from the diagnosis and the patients are treated with highly toxic drugs and invasive intubations. Especially for elderly people and patients with pre-existing conditions such a treatment can be fatal, as we have outlined in the article “Fatal Therapie.”  Without doubt eventual excess mortality rates are caused by the therapy and by the lockdown measures, while the “COVID-19” death statistics comprise also patients who died of a variety of diseases, redefined as COVID-19 only because of a “positive” test result whose value could not be more doubtful.  NOTES:- [1] Sensitivity is defined as the proportion of patients with disease in whom the test is positive; and specificity is defined as the proportion of patients without disease in whom the test is negative.

133,"Trump official revises Statue of Liberty poem to defend migrant rule change Published 14 August 2019 image copyright Getty Images A top US immigration official has revised a quote inscribed on the Statue of Liberty in defence of a new policy that denies food aid to legal migrants. The head of Citizenship and Immigration Services tweaked the passage: ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free"". The official added the words ""who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge"". He later said the poem had referred to ""people coming from Europe"". Ken Cuccinelli, the Trump administration's acting head of Citizenship and Immigration Services, announced on Monday a new ""public charge"" requirement that limits legal migrants from seeking certain public benefits such as public housing or food aid, or are considered likely to do so in the future. image copyright Getty Images image caption The New Colossus was written by New York-born poet Emma Lazarus in 1883 The new regulation, known as a ""public charge rule"", was published in the Federal Register on Monday and will take effect on 15 October. The rule change is intended to reinforce ""ideals of self-sufficiency"", officials said. Critics argue that it will prevent low-income US residents from seeking help. What did the official say? On Tuesday, Mr Cuccinelli was asked by NPR whether the 1883 poem titled The New Colossus at the Statue of Liberty still applied. ""Would you also agree that Emma Lazarus's words etched on the Statue of Liberty, 'Give me your tired, give me your poor,' are also a part of the American ethos?"" asked NPR's Rachel Martin. image copyright Getty Images image caption Ken Cuccinelli, the acting head of US Citizenship and Immigration Services ""They certainly are,"" Mr Cuccinelli responded. ""Give me your tired and your poor - who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge."" ""That plaque was put on the Statue of Liberty at almost the same time as the first public charge [law] was passed - very interesting timing,"" he added. The actual passage reads in part: ""Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"" In the interview, he added that immigrants are welcome ""who can stand on their own two feet, be self-sufficient, pull themselves up by their bootstraps, again, as in the American tradition"". After the host asked if the policy ""appears to change the definition of the American dream,"" he said: ""We invite people to come here and join us as a privilege. ""No one has a right to become an American who isn't born here as an American."" media caption Top immigration official says public charge rule will not target ""any particular group"" Mr Cuccinelli was pressed later on CNN about his comments, and pushed back on claims he was trying to re-write the poem. He insisted he was answering a question and accused people on the left of ""twisting"" his comments. Then asked by anchor Erin Burnett about what America stands for, he said: ""Of course that poem was referring back to people coming from Europe - where they had class-based societies where people were considering wretched if they weren't in the right class."" The two then discussed their own immigrant ancestry, with Ms Burnett pointing out his rule would have ""excluded"" her family. ""I'm here because they were allowed in, and I'm an anchor on CNN,"" she said. Beto O'Rouke, a Democratic presidential hopeful from Texas, shared a clip from the interview and said the comments show his Trump administration ""think the Statue of Liberty only applies to white people"". This administration finally admitted what we’ve known all along: They think the Statue of Liberty only applies to white people. https://t.co/kTLl50yCmw — Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) August 14, 2019 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter Who will be affected by the new rule? Immigrants who are already permanent residents in the US are unlikely to be affected by the rule change. It also does not apply to refugees and asylum applicants. But applicants for visa extensions, green cards or US citizenship will be subject to the change. Those who do not meet income standards or who are deemed likely to rely on benefits such as Medicaid (government-run healthcare) or housing vouchers in future may be blocked from entering the country. Those already in the US could also have their applications rejected. An estimated 22 million legal residents in the US are without citizenship, and many of these are likely to be affected. President Trump has made immigration a central theme of his administration. This latest move is part of his government's efforts to curb legal immigration. What has reaction been? The Democratic led House Homeland Security Committee condemned Mr Cuccinelli's revision in a tweet, calling the words ""vile and un-American"". ""It's clear the Trump Administration just wants to keep certain people out,"" the committee wrote, calling Mr Cuccinelli ""a xenophobic, anti-immigrant fringe figure who has no business being in government"". Others pointed to his background as the attorney general of Virginia, in which he led a conservative campaign against immigration and homosexuality. Asked about Mr Cuccinelli's remarks on Tuesday, President Trump did not directly respond to the Statue of Liberty quote, but said: ""I don't think it's fair to have the American taxpayer pay for people to come into the United States."" ""I'm tired of seeing our taxpayer paying for people to come into the country and immediately go onto welfare and various other things.",true/false
134,"In most discussions of suicide and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — including the online buzz that followed publication of a Times analysis on how young California veterans die — one statistic gets repeated most: 22 veterans kill themselves each day. That number comes from a study published in early 2013 by researchers at the federal Department of Veterans Affairs. But the recent wars were not the study’s primary focus. In fact, they play a minor role in veteran suicides overall. Advertisement The VA researchers used death records from 21 states to come up with a 2010 national estimate for veterans of all ages. As a group, veterans are old. Military service being far rarer than it was in the days of the draft, more than 91% of the nation’s 22 million veterans are at least 35 years old, and the overwhelming majority did not serve in the post-9/11 era. About 72% of veterans are at least 50. It is not surprising, then, that the VA found that people in this age group account for 69% of veteran suicides — or more than 15 of the 22 per day. Many experts believe that the farther a veteran is from military service, the less likely it is that his or her suicide has anything to do with his or her time in uniform. In other words, many older veterans are killing themselves for the same reasons that other civilians in the same age group kill themselves: depression and other mental health problems coupled with difficult life circumstances. The VA analysis does not attempt to determine rates of veteran suicide or how they compare with rates for people who never served. Those are surprisingly difficult questions to answer, mainly because the government does not systematically track service members after they leave the military. Advertisement The Times tackled the problem using data on California deaths from 2006 to 2011, the most recent six years available. Rather than focus exclusively on suicide, the analysis considered all 42,734 deaths of adults under 35, a group that includes those veterans most likely to have served in the recent wars. In addition to the cause of death and a variety of other information, each record includes a box indicating veteran status. In the course of reporting, it became clear that the local coroners and funeral home directors who fill out the forms also use that box for active-duty deaths. The Armed Forces Medical Examiner System provided data on active-duty deaths in California by age, gender and cause, allowing The Times to subtract those figures and arrive at the veteran totals. Advertisement The VA provided the California veteran population estimates that The Times used to calculate overall death rates and break them down by cause. The death rates for other civilians were determined using population data from the U.S. Census Bureau. One more step was required to make the comparisons relevant. California veterans under 35 are about 80% male, and nearly half are over 29. A straight comparison to the general population in that age group would be less than ideal, since suicide and accident rates vary significantly by gender and age. Advertisement The Times adjusted the non-veteran death rates so they reflected the age and gender mix of the veteran population. As the story explained, suicide and accident rates were substantially higher for veterans. Over the six years examined by The Times, 329 California veterans under 35 took their own lives. That amounts to an average annual rate of 27 suicides per 100,000 veterans. Advertisement If that rate were to hold true across the country, about 530 young veterans are committing suicide each year — roughly 1.5 each day. That’s probably an underestimate, because there are regional variations in suicide and California tends to fall on the low side. But in talking about the aftermath of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it’s far closer to reality than 22 each day.

135,"Joseph R. Biden declared last year on the campaign trail that he began his academic career at Delaware State University, a historically Black college, a claim that the school refutes.  Carlos Holmes, director of news service for Delaware State, said that Mr. Biden was never a student, although he has made appearances twice on campus for commencement speeches at the public university in Dover, one of the nation’s historically Black colleges and universities HBCUs.  “Vice President Biden did not attend DSU,” said Mr. Holmes in a Thursday email. “However he was the Commencement keynote speaker in 2003 and [2016], and during the former he was awarded an honorary doctoral degree.”  Mr. Biden made the claim ahead of the South Carolina Democratic primary during a town hall held Oct. 26, 2019, at historic Wilson High School in Florence, which was founded in 1866 by the Freedmen’s Bureau for Black children seeking an education.  “I got started out of an HBCU, Delaware State — now, I don’t want to hear anything negative about Delaware State,” Mr. Biden told the audience, drawing laughter, as shown on video. “They’re my folks.”  Mr. Biden, who went on to win the South Carolina primary on his way to the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, has been long accused of making up the DSU connection, but the university’s denial appears to erase any doubt.  The Washington Times has reached out to the Biden campaign for comment.  Mr. Biden’s 2007 memoir, “Promises to Keep,” proceeds from his years at Archmere Academy, a private Catholic school in Clayton, Delaware, to his enrollment as a freshman at the University of Delaware without mentioning Delaware State.  Biden claims he “got started out of an HBCU, Delaware State” when he did not attend the universitypic.twitter.com/LnBOS1wQlT — Tommy Pigott @TCPigott October 26, 2019  The former vice president has been caught numerous times embellishing his biography, including statements that he was the first in his family to attend college and that his relatives worked as coal miners, both of which he later admitted were false.  Mr. Biden has also been accused of exaggerating his record on civil-rights activism, such as his assertions about participating in marches. During his first presidential run in 1987, for example, he declared that he “marched with tens of thousands,” a claim that has been largely discounted.  The 2010 biography “Joe Biden” by veteran political reporter Jules Witcover described him as someone who was sympathetic to the movement but “was taking no visible part in either the local racial unrest or the war protest.”  “It was not until his exposure to black contemporaries as a lifeguard, he said, that he finally began to understand, and then he saw his best engagement as a lawyer, not a marcher,” the book said.  Earlier this month, the Biden campaign named DSU President Tony Allen, who previously worked as a speechwriter in Mr. Biden’s Senate office, to the Biden transition team advisory council.

136,"William Jefferson Clinton’s military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay began on Friday, following a three-day delay caused by a female panelist whose amorous display of affection toward the former president shocked the Office of Military Commissions.  The joviality and swagger Clinton displayed on Monday had evaporated when uniformed MPs escorted him to GITMO’s south courtroom Friday morning. A much more sullen and forlorn Bill Clinton, head hung low, was seated at the defense table beside the advocate he had chosen to represent him, the venerable David E. Kendall.  Kendall is an American attorney, a graduate of Wabash College, Yale Law School, and Worcester College, Oxford, who clerked with Supreme Court Justice Byron White, worked as associate counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and has been a partner at Williams & Connolly LLP of Washington, DC since 1981, where he has provided legal counsel to individuals and corporations on high-profile business and political matters. He represented Clinton during the 1998-1999 impeachment proceedings stemming from Clinton’s relations with White House intern Monica Lewinski.  At the start of Friday’s proceedings, Kendall boldly asked Rear Adm. John G. Hannink to “dismiss without prejudice” all charges leveled against Bill Clinton. Those charges include murder, sex crimes against minors, treason, theft of government property,  “President Clinton should not have to answer for the crimes of Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has already been sentenced and put to death. For many years, William Jefferson Clinton was largely oblivious to his wife’s transgressions, and once he became aware of them, he had only a peripheral involvement, at best. Make no mistake, she called all the shots. My client was along for the ride,” Kendall said.  “It was all Hillary,” Bill Clinton said.  But Vice Adm. Hannink was unimpressed at Clinton’s refusal to take accountability for his misdeeds. Paraphrasing author Peter Schweizer’s observation in the book Clinton Cash, Vice Adm. Hannink noted that “the couple that steals together, stays together,” and expounded on that theory by telling the tribunal that “apparently, the couple that kills together, stays together too.”  “And there is no statute of limitations on murder, not even for you, detainee Clinton,” Vice Adm. Hannink said.  “My client never killed anyone,” Kendall interjected.  His statement prompted Vice Adm. Hannink to play a taped telephone call for the tribunal. It was a 1993 conversation between Bill Clinton, then-Attorney General Janet Reno, then-ATF chief David Chipman, and former FBI director William Sessions. The call, recorded on day 50 of the Waco standoff between Branch Davidian leader David Koresh and U.S. alphabet agencies, underpinned Clinton’s mounting hatred of not only Koresh but also the women and children sheltered within the compound. Reno, Chipman, and Sessions urged Clinton to swiftly resolve the protracted stalemate, arguing that his indecisiveness would empower future “domestic terrorists” and religious zealots to follow in Koresh’s footsteps. Reno pleaded with Clinton to “burn them out,” and both Chipman and Sessions, after expressing mild trepidations, agreed the situation had become untenable. Clinton gave them “carte blanche,” and encouraged them to eliminate “malcontents” as long as blame was assigned to Koresh and the U.S. government was held harmless for any fatalities.  “I don’t care what happens to them, they didn’t vote for me anyway,” Clinton said on the call. “If they die, they die. Just make sure the finger can’t be pointed back at us, or more importantly, me. Let’s nip this in the bud right now.”  As most know, on day 51 the FBI and ATF launched a siege on the Branch Davidian Compound. A fire consumed the facility, and 76 Branch Davidians, including Koresh, 25 children, and two pregnant women, were reduced to ashes. Janet Reno later claimed that Koresh had burned out his own people, even though video footage of government vehicles and personnel equipped with flamethrowers and other incendiary devices surfaced in pictures and video.  On a recorded telephone call captured three days after the siege, Clinton congratulated Reno, saying the Branch Davidians “got what they deserved.”  In GITMO’s south courtroom, Vice Adm. Hannink replayed the recording several times.  “This was not Hillary; this was all you. You were president, not your wife. Nowhere is she heard on these calls. No one here is saying Koresh was a nice guy. But you, detainee Clinton, ordered those deaths,” Vice Adm. Hannink said.  Kendall objected, claiming the tapes had not been entered into discovery and, thus, he had been given no opportunity to rebut their validity.  “I understand you were an accomplished civilian litigator, Mr. Kendall, but this is a military commission, operating under full force and effect of the insurrection act,” Vice Adm. Hannink replied.  Kendall altered his tone and calmly requested a 72-hour continuance, until Monday morning, to allow him to authenticate the tapes.  “Very well, this commission will grant you your 72 hours, but we’ll tolerate no further delays after this,” Vice Adm. Hannink said.  He put the tribunal in recess until ten hundred hours Monday morning.  (Visited 49,340 times, 13,771 visits today)",true/false
137,"Hannity, Laura, and the whole gang over at Fox News are in for a MAGA surprise! It has just been announced that they are winning one of the most coveted awards in journalism — the Pulitzer.  Oh, the liberal media is going to be kicking dirt about this one.  This accolade is specific to their “fair and balanced” coverage of the crisis. The network has been on the ball through this entire ordeal, making sure the public is educated on the dangers of the current crisis.  Joe Barron, Chairman of the Pulitzer Committee had this to say about the nomination:  “We are pleased to announce that Pulitzer is awarding Fox News with the ‘Illusory Reporting Award.’ This is an honor we reserve only for them, as they have earned their place as leader in this category. Congratulations to the network and their viewership. You are America!”  Specifically, on March 9, Hannity took to the airwaves to dismiss the entire thing and ignore the failure of the Trump administration, obviously intending to calm the masses, no matter how inaccurate the reporting.  Laura Ingrahm obviously got the talking points memo from the White House at that time, also dismissing the emergency and calling all other reporting of the facts as “panic pushers.”  Last but not least, Fox & Friends candidly joked about how empty the airports were and actually told people that, “It’s actually the safest time to fly.”  Just to clear this up, it’s not. No agency on March 13, or since then, says you should be traveling unnecessarily.  Oh, where would we be without these stellar journalists? Some say more prepared.

138,"During the predawn hours on New Year’s Day, Delta Force operators infiltrated a Biden-controlled stronghold in southeast Ukraine near the port city of Mariupol, according to an anonymous White House Source who said President Trump greenlit the operation following a series of telephone calls to US military commanders and to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.  A Delta detachment, known as 1-SFOD in the Special Operations community, flew from Okinawa Japan to the US Embassy in Kyiv and held position there until Trump cleared the incursion with his Ukrainian counterparts.  Reliable sources said the Trump administration had obtained “credible evidence�? that the Biden family, by proxy, owned a 200-acre estate and office building 50km northwest of Mariupol. On paper the property was owned by Paradigm Global Advisors, a hedge fund firm in which the Bidens have controlling interest. In the late summer of 2006 Joe Biden’s son Hunter and Joe’s younger brother, James, bought the firm. On the first day on the job, they showed up with Biden’s other son, Beau, and three large men and fired Paradigm’s president and 95% of staff, according to a Paradigm executive who was present. After that, much of Paradigm’s overseas ventures went dark but continued to rake in hefty profits despite a conspicuous lack of investors.  In June 2009 Washington Free Beacon writer Thomas Breslin opined the following statement: “Paradigm is hardly a reputable company. The Bidens fired everyone and put their own people in place. The company became nothing less than a slush fund for illicit monies that the Bidens laundered through the place.�?  The Trump administration has spent four years ferreting out the truth behind Paradigm Global Advisors, according to our White House informant.  “After years of digging, Trump finally caught a break. A current Paradigm employee—someone the Biden’s fucked over—came forward with enough evidence for Trump to make this move. I don’t know what specific evidence was presented, but it must have been some heavy-hitting stuff for Trump to call on Delta to take care of it.�?  At 3am on New Year’s Day, three Blackhawk helicopters, including decoy aircraft, airlifted Delta from Kyiv to the drop zone. The team found the office building empty, devoid of life. The unit commander described the building as “frigid,�? as if it had been vacant and without heat for a long time.  “The windows were covered in a hoarfrost glaze, and the place had a catacomb chill about it,�? he was quoted as saying. “Every office had been stripped—no chairs, no desks, no computers, no nothing. No electricity.�?  Although the building was long deserted, Delta found evidence of recent activity within the hacienda attached to the compound. In a kitchen were freshly chopped vegetables and a percolator of lukewarm coffee. Outside, fresh tire impressions led away from the compound. It was as if someone had tipped off the occupants.  But in the hacienda Delta hit paydirt. They seized several laptops and 300 million dollars in gold bullion. They also found crates of Chinese-manufactured Type 56 assault rifles and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition. Even more disturbing, they found beneath the hacienda a maze of chambers and tunnels that ran for miles in every direction. Ankle and wrist shackles, bolted to the walls in various locations, held bits of necrotic flesh, and in an antechamber, they discovered twelve duffel bags filled with black tar heroin.  On Trump’s order, Delta coordinated with Ukraine’s SBU, that nation’s security agency in counterintelligence and combatting terrorism, to confiscate evidence and await the arrival of State Department personnel.  This is a developing story and will be updated as is appropriate.  (Visited 165,492 times, 164,962 visits today)",true/false
139,"I attended a dinner party this past weekend and was intrigued by the tone of the conversations that swirled around the room. There were, of course, the typical fluff conversations that were intended to lightly touch the surface of various subjects – but then there were conversations circling around Ebola and an underlying distrust of the government.  This was actually surprising to me, since I was in the heart of Los Angeles and these people were definitely not clinging to their guns and religion. The majority of them were upper middle class – baby boomers and yuppies who would never want to be thought of as conservative, but as more libertarian in their political views.  I sat with two men and a woman who were debating the question of whether or not Ebola was something to really be concerned about, and their comments took me aback. The men were bringing up the fact that in the past few years, everything that has come out of Washington has been misleading or an out and out lie – from Obamacare, if you like your doctor, to the Department of Veterans Affairs allowing vets to die waiting for an appointment. They said that they were viewing the reassurances about Ebola coming from the CDC with a skeptical eye. Their biggest question was: Why is there no urgency to stop the disease from entering the U.S.?  At that point I jumped in with some facts I had just discovered about the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Thomas Frieden, who has been the out front spokesman on the Ebola crisis. I found an article published by the Washington Post on July 16 of this year reporting that Frieden had been called to testify on Capitol Hill about researchers at his agency that had mishandled live anthrax and other deadly pathogens in a number of mishaps over the past year or so. This came on the heels of federal officials finding forgotten smallpox samples in a storage room at the National Institute for Health campus in Bethesda, Maryland. They also discovered 12 boxes and 327 vials with pathogens that included the virus behind dengue and spotted fever. When Frieden testified about the anthrax, his response was: We missed a critical pattern, and the pattern is an insufficient culture of safety. Really? And this is the guy in charge of making decisions on Ebola?  Morgan Brittany teams up with the other PolitiChicks -- Gina Loudon and Ann-Marie Murrell -- in their first blockbuster, What Women Really Want -- order your copy today!  TRENDING: Voters blame Biden for border crisis, ready to punish Democrats, poll says  Upon hearing this latest evidence of the incompetence permeating our government, the conversation veered into conspiracy territory. One of the men brought up the fact that Washington has known for months if not years that we were at risk for some sort of global pandemic. According to a government supplier of emergency products, the Disaster Assistance Response Team was told to be prepared to be activated in the month of October for an outbreak of Ebola. Hmm, that's just like the fact that they knew 60,000 illegal children were going to be coming across our southern border eight months before it happened.  Questions were then brought up about the stockpiling of ammunition and weapons by Homeland Security over the past couple of years and the $1 billion worth of disposable FEMA coffins supposedly stored in Georgia. Why was there preparation being made for FEMA camps to house people in isolation? These were the questions being seriously discussed.  Recent polls show that there is a crisis of confidence among the people. When the people lose all trust in their government because of the lies they have been told over and over again, theories begin to emerge about all sorts of things. We desperately need someone to rebuild the trust and restore faith in this government. The damage that has been done is almost irreparable.  My fear is that this has all been orchestrated from the very beginning. Who knows? Maybe the current administration needs this to happen so martial law can be declared, guns can be seized and the populace can be controlled. Once that happens … game over.

140,"Plastic straws and drink stirrers, and cotton buds with plastic stems will be banned from sale and use in England from next April, the government has confirmed.  The move, which has been in the offing for more than a year, is hoped to vastly reduce the litter and other environmental impacts of the nearly 5bn plastic straws currently used each year in England, along with more than 300m plastic stirrers and close to 2bn cotton buds with plastic stems.  Huge numbers of these items, particularly cotton buds, are flushed down toilets or otherwise end up in litter – surveys have recently found waterways across the UK teeming with plastic, putting wildlife at risk.  Alternatives are available, including serving drinks without straws or stirrers, which is preferable, or using paper straws and biodegradable products in place of plastic stirrers and cotton buds. The only exceptions to the new rule will be for people with a medical need or disability, for whom plastic straws and other materials will be available upon request.  The EU is also moving to phase out plastics in various forms.  A government consultation found that more than 80% of respondents supported a ban on the distribution and sale of plastic straws, while nine out of 10 people wanted a ban on drink stirrers, and a similar number supported a ban on plastic-handled cotton buds.  Registered pharmacies will be permitted to sell plastic straws, over the counter or online, but restaurants, pubs and other catering establishments will not be allowed to display plastic straws or provide them automatically.  Michael Gove, the environment secretary, said: “Urgent and decisive action is needed to tackle plastic pollution. These items are often used for just a few minutes, but take hundreds of years to break down.”  Campaigners welcomed the government’s move. Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of Surfers Against Sewage, which campaigns against plastic pollution, said: “Stopping the production and distribution of these single-use plastic menaces will prevent them from polluting beaches nationwide. It’s a really positive and bold step in the right direction against plastic pollution.”  However, the items expected to be banned were only part of the plastic problem, said Emma Priestland, campaigner at Friends of the Earth. “These three items are just a fraction of the single-use nasties that are used for a tiny amount of time before polluting the environment for centuries to come,” she said.  “Ultimately, we need producers to take responsibility for the plastic pollution caused by all their products, whether it’s bags, balloons, packets, containers or otherwise. That’s why we’re campaigning for legislation to cut back on pointless plastic across the board.”",true/false
141,"A military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay has convicted Microsoft Founder Bill Gates on charges including child trafficking, pedophilia, conspiracy, money laundering, murder, and public health endangerment—the conclusion of five days of heated testimony that repeatedly saw Vice Adm. John G. Hannink of the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps square off against attorney David Baluarte.  The fireworks continued Wednesday morning as Vice Adm. Hannink offered into evidence additional proof of Gates’ illicit ties to the vaccine industry. Documents obtained from Gates’ personal server outlined how he in 2011 distributed vaccines “carrying serious side effects up to and including death” to 41,000 children in poverty-stricken India, after meeting “mild” resistance from vaccine distributors in the U.S. Gates claimed the vaccination granted absolute immunity against a strain of “super polio” that was ravaging the impoverished.  Rather than inoculate recipients against polio, the vaccine exacerbated it and left over 40,000 children crippled or dead. And while cases of polio indeed were on the rise, the mysterious “super polio” was pure fiction, invented by Gates and a consortium of international vaccine distributors. Gates even travelled to India to help administer the product, which was often given orally, as a sign of good faith.  “By his own documents, Gates and his people had waged a massive marketing campaign to convince the people of India that his “super polio” was resilient to current vaccinations and that only his product, which he personally endorsed, could stave off the imaginary, virulent strain. He had the audacity to handfeed his poison to innocent children,” Vice Adm. Hannink addressed the tribunal.  Baluarte objected: “Let’s pretend a moment that this court is just. Let’s further pretend these outlandish tales are true. How, tell me, can an American military court prosecute for crimes against foreigners on foreign soil?”  “If all things were equal, that would be correct,” Vice Adm. Hannink admitted. “But all things are not equal. American missionaries worked alongside medical staff in India. Some of those American missionaries had young children—children who took the Gates vaccine.”  Six of six children, Vice Adm. Hannink said, developed complete and irreversible paralysis, followed by cerebral hemorrhaging and death within 90 days of inoculation.  Since the children were American citizens, born to American parents, the military had authority to prosecute Gates for their deaths, as is stipulated in the Insurrection Act of 1807, which Donald J. Trump activated prior to leaving office.  “Gates’ diabolical ventures didn’t stop with India,” Vice Adm. Hannink told the 3-officer panel. “Four years later, he repeated his so-called humanitarian mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo—that time claiming he’d developed a cure for HIV. And while we can’t prove any Americans died of that drug, we know at least 27,000 Africans did—and this all points to motive.”  Vice Adm. Hannink pivoted to more current events, questioning Gates’ relationship to Dr. Anthony Fauci.  “You met privately with Fauci five times, at his home and yours, between December 2019 and July 2020. Your own documents discussed ‘donating’ tens of millions of dollars to pharmaceutical manufacturers in exchange for getting 10 times your ‘investment’ back once vaccines were marketed. In your own words, Fauci approved of the idea. If you’re such a philanthropist, why were you expecting kickbacks?” Vice Adm. Hannink said.  Gates’ lawyer instructed him to not answer the question.  “And did you not discuss placing what you referred to as a ‘nano-centric biometric recorder’ into vaccines—a chip, as it were, that would send biomedical data of recipients back to the vaccine manufacturers and to the NIH and to the CDC without the recipient’s knowledge?” Vice Adm. Hannink went on. “This invasion of privacy—and we are working to determine if this took place and the scope—is just another of example of Gates’ madness. We believe the Office of Military Commissions has offered enough prove to convict the accused and sentence him to death. But that decision is in your hands,” he told the 3-officer panel.  The officers needed not one minute to reach a unanimous decision; they found Gates guilty on all charges and asked that he be hanged for his atrocities. Vice Adm. Hannink set an execution date of October 5, 2021.  (Visited 273,754 times, 10 visits today)",true/false
142,"Proctor, VT — According to NBC News, a pastor at the Christian Proctor Church in Vermont, has been sentenced to one year in federal prison after refusing to marry gay couples. This comes shortly after the Supreme Court’s 5-4 decisionruling that states must allow gay marriage. The Christian Pastor, 56-year-old Paul Horner, had his lawyer speak to reporters on his behalf. “We are currently disputing the guilty verdict and I am confident my client will be a free man here shortly,” said attorney Tom Downey. “Horner was just using his best judgement according to his rights and religious freedom in this country.” The Honorable Myron Danus handed down the harsh sentence. “Religious freedom goes both ways, Mr. Horner,” Danus told a packed courtroom. “It is not your place to deny individuals the same rights that everyone else has, rights that were passed down and agreed upon in a court of law, the ultimate court, the Supreme Court. It is not your decision whether or not you agree with the law but more importantly that you follow it and enforce it.” According to the criminal investigation, the Christian Proctor Church is registered with the state as a “religious corporation” limited to performing “one-man-one-woman marriages as defined by the Holy Bible.” But the church is also registered as a for-profit business and city officials said that means the owners must comply with state and federal regulations. Steve Shand president of the Vermont Family Research Committee, said it is “open season on Americans who refuse to bow to the government’s redefinition of marriage.” “Homosexuals are gay,” Shand told reporters. “Why should Christian ministers be forced to perform and celebrate any marriage that conflicts with their beliefs? It’s a slippery slope my friend. Pretty soon these same pastors will be forced to wed animals or kitchen appliances. This is not my America!” Gwen Hawkins who is president of the LGBT Pride Center in Vermont said she is happy with the guilty verdict. “We just want the same rights as everyone else and this guilty verdict sets a great precedent,” Hawkins said. “These fanatical Christians base their life on one verse in the Bible but they seem to forget the other 99% of the verses in the book. For example, why can’t we stone to death Bristol Palin for having a baby out of wedlock? And what about her mother, Sarah Palin, breaking the rules of Corinthians 14:34 which clearly state that as a woman, she is not allowed to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet. But no, they like to pick the one verse in the Bible about gay people and build their camp around it.” Proctor is a town in Rutland County, Vermont, United States. The population was 1,741 at the 2010 census. Proctor is home to the Vermont Marble Museum, Wilson Castle and the only marble bridge in America.",true/false

145,"A new report from Italy’s Higher Institute of Health provides an objective analysis of the nation’s misleading covid-19 death tally. Italy’s official covid death tally rose to 132,161 in October of 2021. This tally is unrealistic because covid-19 was diagnosed in haste and under conditions of financial bribery using non-specific diagnostic criteria.  Covid-19 was often listed as the cause of death when it was merely “suspected” and when “it could not be ruled out.”  After careful review of the medical reports, it turns out that respiratory infections may have been a contributing factor but did not cause most of these covid-19 deaths outright.  Various forms of medical malpractice, withheld treatment, inhumane isolation, undernourishment, and unethical standards of care are at the root of this worldwide medical crisis. The deaths are real, but the causes are skewed.  New medical analysis reduces Italy’s covid-19 death tally by 97.1%  A new analysis reduced Italy’s covid-19 death tally by 97.1 percent and provided a more accurate picture as to why these people died in the hospital. Only 3,783 cases could be directly correlated with a covid-19 diagnosis. Because the PCR test (that was designed to detect covid-19) was fraudulently-calibrated from the start, even these 3,783 cases of covid-19 are suspect.  Symptoms of respiratory infection could have been the result of any number of infections that kill people every year, whether that be influenza, tuberculosis, pneumonia or countless other lower and upper respiratory tract infections. Viral infections do not have the same effect on one person to the next due to several underlying factors including the cellular and microbiome terrain, so it is extremely difficult to accurately diagnose a specific respiratory infection and quantify viral load.  According to this new analysis, only 2.9% of the deaths registered since the end of February 2020 have been caused by the novel SARS coronavirus that has never been isolated from humans and replicated in human tissue samples. The annual respiratory infections, antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, medical errors and other acute medical emergencies that usually cause overcrowding in hospitals were used as propaganda to terrorize and defraud the world into perpetual lock down.  The covid-19 death tally included Italians who suffered from one to five underlying chronic diseases; many were on immune suppressant drugs, and a certain percentage died from medical emergencies that are totally unrelated to covid-19. A total of 67.7% suffered from more than three chronic diseases that had not been resolved through modern medicine. Italians who were already suffering from chronic conditions went on to suffer further from ventilator-associated pneumonia and ventilator-associated lung damage.  One in ten of the deceased patients had a stroke; 65.8% of the Italians had arterial hypertension and were on immune-suppressant drugs; 15.7% suffered from heart failure; 28% had ischemic heart disease; and 24.8% suffered from atrial fibrillation. At least 17.4% already had sick lungs. Many (29.3% had diabetes and other metabolic ailments) that drastically impacted their immune response.  There were several patients (16.3%) who were on their deathbed, struggling on immunosuppressant chemotherapy and radiation drugs known to make people susceptible to any respiratory infection.  These cancer patients had been dealing with cancer for the past five years, with an average three-to-five-year chemotherapy survival rate coming to a close. Another 23.5% were struggling with dementia, their life coming to a close.  Unethical, inhumane practices have been implemented in medical systems worldwide  Ever since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a worldwide pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, medical systems around the world have handled hospitalized patients differently. Patients with any sort of respiratory symptom were isolated and separated from family members.  “Out of an abundance of caution,” hospital systems made vague diagnoses, classifying anyone “suspected of covid” as an official case of SARS-CoV-2. These patients were viewed as highly contagious vectors of disease that should be isolated and put on mechanical ventilation.  Efficacious treatments were bypassed. People dying on ventilators were classified as covid deaths “when covid-19 could not be ruled out as the primary cause of their death.”  As terror and fear were propagated across the media, hospital systems put non-urgent, elective procedures on hold, suspending routine outpatient services that left many chronic patients without adequate medical care.  Industrialized nations like Italy did not implement at-home treatment plans and did not distribute nutraceuticals and prophylactics to help control respiratory disease in the population. This caused populations to be dependent on an already overcrowded system that is not set up to deal with panic, ignorance and helplessness.  As nations continue to put all their stock in retrovirus-contaminated influenza jjabs and experimental gene interference coronavirus jjabs, people continue to suffer and die, even as countless anti-viral, bronco-dilating, anti-inflammatory immune therapies exist.

146,"Jeremy Corbyn used his second keynote speech as Labour leader to launch an excoriating attack on wealthy individuals and corporations that avoid UK taxes – and pledged that a Labour government led by him would end the practice forever.  There is nothing more unpatriotic than not paying your taxes, he told delegates in the packed-out conference hall in Liverpool, to loud applause.  It is an act of vandalism, damaging our NHS, damaging older people’s social care, damaging younger people’s education. So a Labour government will make shabby tax avoidance a thing of the past.  HMRC estimates that illegal tax evasion and legal tax avoidance together cost the government about £34 billion a year, though in practice most experts agree much less than this could ever actually be collected. Successive Labour and Conservative governments have pledged to crack down on tax avoidance.  Corbyn also singled out former BHS owner Sir Philip Green for criticism over his tax affairs in a section of the speech attacking the Conservative government.  They’ve cut taxes for the privileged few, sold off our national assets to them, always on the cheap, and turned a blind eye to their chronic tax avoidance, he said of the Conservatives.  They’re so committed to the interests of the very richest they recruited Sir Philip Green into government as something called an efficiency tsar. Well, government might be a bit more efficient if the super rich like Sir Philip actually paid their taxes.  Green, who owns Topshop, was knighted by the last Labour government but was appointed as efficiency tsar by David Cameron in 2010. Green's companies are owned through his wife, who is based in Monaco, which means his family's tax liabilities are legally – but substantially – reduced versus what he would pay if he and his wife were UK-resident.",true/false

149,"Pilots of Southwest Airlines and other major U.S. carriers have good reason for resisting vaccination mandates. Their fellow pilots who had taken the controversial Covid-19 vaccine have been dropping dead on both domestic and international flights.  Two weeks ago, Dr. Jane Ruby claimed on the Stew Peters Show that a Delta Airlines pilot died inflight, shortly after the pilot had received a second dose of the Covid-19 vaccination. The mainstream media, Delta, and the so-called fact-checking agencies quickly dismissed the claim, calling it false and unsubstantiated—mainly because the claimant did not supply the name of the pilot, the flight number, or the points of origin and destination for the flight.  Nonetheless, Real Raw News felt the issue deserved further investigation. Although we cannot authenticate Dr. Ruby’s specific incident, we learned that at least two freshly vaccinated pilots had dropped dead midflight within weeks of having received a Covid-19 vaccination.  An FAA whistleblower speaking under condition of anonymity told RRN that the Biden administration, the FAA, and the airlines are covering up the incidents because the airlines need ticket sales and because the administration wants to maintain the illusion that Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective.  According to him, two American Airline pilots in 14 days have perished in the cockpit.  On October 15, American Airlines Flight 2740, an Airbus A320, was enroute from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport to Fort Meyers (RSW) when the unthinkable happened. As the plane began a gradual decent toward southwest Florida, the pilot in command (PIC) began convulsing and had a cardiac arrest. Fortunately, the aircraft was still on autopilot, giving the co-pilot time to evaluate the situation, unharness himself, pull the PIC from his seat and try to administer CPR. But his efforts were in vain.  The co-pilot returned to his seat and squawked 7700, the international transponder code for “I have an emergency.” The plane landed safely, but the co-pilot was put on administrative leave for having left his seat and endangering the aircraft, our source said.  “It was later determined that the PIC had a fatal heart attack caused by myocarditis, a known side effect of the Covid-19 vaccinations. He had received his second dose of the vaccine two weeks before that flight. His last full physical was three months prior, and his doctor had given him a clean bill of health,” our source said.  The second fatality took place a week later, and it, too was a DFW departure. American Airlines Flight 971, an Airbus A321, departed DFW for LAX at 8:00 a.m. Midway through the flight, the co-pilot complained he had chest pains but chalked it up to having eaten a spicy meal before departure. He told the PIC it was indigestion. As the plane flew at 32,000 ft. over the New Mexico/Arizona state line, the co-pilot started convulsing and vomiting on the flight controls. At that point, the PIC contacted Air Traffic Control, requesting permission to swing around and make an emergency landing in Albuquerque, NM, but ATC, after apparently consulting American Airlines, denied the request and compelled the PIC to complete the flight to LAX.  The co-pilot died in his chair, also from acute myocarditis. He had gotten his second vaccination—Pfizer—21 days ahead of that fateful flight.  “The PIC was put under a gag order and told not to discuss the incident with anyone under threat of losing his job,” our source said. “There is a systematic effort going on right now to prevent the public from knowing about pilots getting very ill or very dead in the air. The airlines don’t want to lose money, and the administration doesn’t want the public to know the true dangers of the vaccine. I know for fact that Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg ordered the airlines to classify incidents involving pilot deaths.”  In closing, he added that he is aware of at least 12 non-fatal incidents involving pilots that had recently taken the jab.

150,"Nation  UPDATED 8:23 PM - K A B O O M! Governor and Secretary of State in Georgia Took Money From China To Steal Election from Trump  UPDATED 8:23 PM EST See Bottom -- Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp and the Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger both allegedly took money from Communist China, perhaps to intentionally THROW or STEAL the November 3 Election in that state, to Joe Biden.  According to very high level sources from my years working National Security Intelligence with the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force, the feds have PROOF of the payments to both Kemp and Raffensperger.  The Trump election legal team forced the President to WAIT before revealing this, until both Kemp and Raffensperger CERTIFIED the Election results.  According to those same sources, once Kemp and Raffensperger CERTIFIED the results, their crime was complete. Both men certified those election results this week. By law, Mr. Raffensperger was obliged to certify the election results before 5 p.m. on Friday. Gov. Kemp, had to then certify the results by 5 p.m. on Saturday. Both men did exactly those acts.  The implications of this revelation are staggering. First, that a sitting REPUBLICAN Governor would stab his Party's President, and our nation, in the back, for a foreign government, is utterly horrifying. People are already asking  My God, what could they have offered that he would sell out his own people? His own country?  That a foreign nation would DARE to pay money in order to rig or steal a U.S. Presidential Election is . . . a casus belli Cause for war. China appears to have tried to STEAL our freedom by STEALING our Elections. War is justified.  Again, the national security intelligence sources with whom I have spoken, assure me this information is solid and the proof is already in government hands.  MORE . . .  Georgia Governor Brian P. Kemp ordered state agencies to buy from Chinese Lenovo and interlocking vendors on Mar. 28, 2019, undermining U.S. sovereignty, the citizens of Georgia, and the 2020 election    The interlocking vendors include members of Obama’s Technology Council and members of the IBM Eclipse Foundation incl. Chinese Tsinghua University that stole the invention of social networking from Columbus-OH-based Leader Technologies, including IBM, Dell, EMC, HP and NetApp.  THESE SYSTEMS WERE USED IN THE 2020 GEORGIA ELECTION!  How did Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger election chief not know this since his election machines ran on this infrastructure?  Kemp’s more than 5% shareholding in First Madison Bank & Trust, now United Community Bank, NASDAQ: UCBI, puts him in direct relationship to Lance F. Drummond TD Canada Trust Rothschild Inc., Aspen Institute.  The Rothschilds are members of the British Pilgrims Society MI6, Privy Council with Lord Mark Malloch-Brown—former UN Dep. Sec. Gen, and CEO of Dominion-Smartmatic election rigging computers with George Soros.  This is a developing story, check back for details . . .  ***** BULLETIN *****  UPDATED 8:23 PM EST --  Intel sources now also confirm that Other Governors, Secretaries of State, State Election officials, County Election officials and even several big city Mayors also allegedly received payments from Communist China and those payments have been tracked as well.

151,"A recent military study shows military personnel evaluated who received the flu vaccine were at 36 percent increased risk for coronavirus with varied benefit in preventing some strains of the flu.  “Examining noninfluenza viruses specifically, the odds of both coronavirus and human metapneumovirus in vaccinated individuals were significantly higher when compared to unvaccinated individuals OR = 1.36 and 1.51, respectively Table 5.”  The flu vaccine studied demonstrated varied benefit in flu prevention – – some strains showed significant benefit while others did not.  Titled, Influenza vaccination and respiratory virus interference among Department of Defense personnel during the 2017–2018 influenza season, the report on the study addresses the phenomena of vaccine virus interference of the influenza vaccine.  Flu Vaccine Interference  Paraphrasing, the study highlights the value of the human body’s ability to fight against viruses. Apparently, by contracting influenza, the body naturally “may reduce the risk of non-influenza respiratory viruses…”  Due to the flu vaccine’s “interference” with the naturally occurring biological process, there may be an increased risk of contracting non-influenza viruses:  “While influenza vaccination offers protection against influenza, natural influenza infection may reduce the risk of non-influenza respiratory viruses by providing temporary, non-specific immunity against these viruses. On the other hand, recently published studies have described the phenomenon of vaccine-associated virus interference; that is, vaccinated individuals may be at increased risk for other respiratory viruses because they do not receive the non-specific immunity associated with natural infection.”  Why This Topic?  I started digging into this topic on the Department of Veterans Affairs’ VA advice two weeks ago when I noticed the agency’s top advice about coronavirus was to “get a flu shot”.  This advice seemed a bit too simplistic when given to a population of largely elderly veterans with significant disabilities, vaccine histories, and exposures to various pathogens worldwide.  After writing about it, one reader sent an email citing this study in PubMed.  I was later provided a copy of the full study and reviewed it with an expert to verify my own conclusions based on the information in that report.  Informed Consent For Flu Vaccine  Now, the feedback I received that really caught my attention was mainly in a question: Is the heightened risk of coronavirus and other pathogens worth the benefit of the influenza vaccine based on this study as broken down in Table 5 above?  The column to focus on is “OR” in Table 5.  Coronavirus is 1.36 meaning 36% higher risk.  The influenza virus overall is 0.57 meaning the risk of contracting the flu was reduced overall. Three variants of flu did not receive a statistically significant reduction in risk.  Three of 8 evaluations noted a statistically insignificant benefit for the flu shot. Meanwhile, shot takers were at increased risk for coronavirus of 36%. I would bet $1 that this year, many Americans would likely rethink taking the vaccine with that bit of information.  If VA has this information, and they likely do, should the agency be required to share this increased risk factor with individuals considering the shot?  Studied Military Population  The study, published in the scientific journal Vaccine January 2020, was conducted by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch Air Force Satellite at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH.  Taken at face value, the study indicates people who receive the flu vaccine are at increased risk for coronavirus pre-COVID-19. Like veterans, current service members, school teachers, and medical professionals, the study population consisted of a population with a history of being heavily vaccinated.  “The DoD provides a unique population for vaccination studies as mandatory vaccination against influenza is required by the DoD for all Active Duty and Reserve Component personnel. This study aims to examine the relationship between specific respiratory viruses and influenza vaccination. The protocol for this study was reviewed and approved as exempt by the Air Force Research Laboratory Institutional Review Board.”  Future § 1151 Claims For Malpractice?  Will veterans who contract the coronavirus after receipt of the flu vaccine based on VA’s top recommendation be eligible for § 1151 claims for malpractice?  How will the US Court of Claims – Vaccine Court handle an influx of US citizens injured by contracting the coronavirus due to the significant risk in the study?  Given that this report was published by DOD researchers in a scientific journal, why is VA telling veterans to get the influenza vaccine?  What is the motive behind their advice?  Veterans, and many disabled veterans, may be at higher risk of contracting coronavirus based on vaccine history alone. That is especially true for veterans who took the flu vaccine at the encouragement of VA doctors.  Who stands to gain with the current recommendation?  There are winners and losers with each of these decisions. The virus itself appears to more severely impact the elderly, of which the veteran population has many.  How about Vietnam veterans exposed to toxic herbicides?  This virus is basically a death sentence for our poorly treated disabled Vietnam veterans who rely on VA to provide safe and effective medical care for their diabetes, cancer, hypertension, etc.  Ask Your Doctor  I encourage all readers to do your own research. Ask your VA medical doctor about this study and whether they agree with the blanket recommendation of the agency to get a flu shot to get ahead of coronavirus.  Is this solid medical advice?  For those interested, the study’s data came from the Department of Defense Global Respiratory Pathogen Surveillance Program DoDGRS is a DoD-wide program established by the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System GEIS.  The individuals included in the study provided respiratory specimens to the DoDGRS for 2017-2018 influenza season. Individuals who were sick prior to receipt of the flu vaccine were excluded from the study:  “All people submitting a respiratory specimen to the DoDGRS for the 2017–2018 influenza season were eligible for the study. The influenza season began 1 October 2017 and ended 29 September 2018. Those who submitted a sample and only tested positive for Chlamydia pneumoniae and/or Mycoplasma pneumoniae were excluded because these illnesses are bacteriological in nature, not viral. People with influenza and non-influenza coinfections were excluded because they could not be uniquely classified as either influenza or non-influenza respiratory virus. Individuals with multiple specimens collected during the season were also removed from the study as they could have had multiple different viruses over the season. Specimens where neither vaccination status could be obtained via databases nor a questionnaire was completed were excluded because vaccination status could not be confirmed. Subjects who were ill before receiving vaccination were excluded as vaccination status would therefore be unrelated to illness. Lastly, those people for whom the laboratory rejected the specimen were not included in the final study population.”  Be Optimistic But Careful  From what I can tell, the odds of being exposed in the US are high. The death rate if you get sick is high enough to warrant concern.  Wouldn’t it be nice to get good advice from the socialized healthcare system managed by the VA that is supposed to provide us with care?  For some non-US centric news about the virus, I wanted to include a YouTube video of 60 Minutes Australia about their perspective on the disease.  Now, this video pushes the narrative that the disease originated from the wet markets in Wuhan that also happened to be located near the level 4 biological laboratory studying the virus. I do not believe we know enough to confirm whether the origin is from such markets or manmade.  Getting Your Flu Shot?  I am personally not getting the flu shot and do not plan on taking any vaccines moving forward beyond what I was forced to take in the military due to vaccine injury.  What are your thoughts? Getting the flu shot to get ahead?",other

153,"The immune system is something that is highly misunderstood not just by everyday people but also by the many conventional doctors who we depend on for health advice.  Most people resort to things like synthetic vitamins and medicines ignoring better natural alternatives to deal with colds and improve immunity, but the cycle of sickness always seems to continue.  For people with compromised immune systems, there are many natural options, and now researchers have discovered what could well be one of the best ways to reset and recharge your immune system; one that happens to be free and is believed to work even in the elderly as well.  White blood cells right help immune response, and they can be recycled through fasting, the study showed.  Three Days to a Whole New Immune System  According to researchers at the University of Southern California, the act of fasting for as little as three days can regenerate the entire immune system, even in elderly people.  The researchers said that fasting helps the body’s stem cells to begin producing new white blood cells, which help to fight off infection.  They added that the discovery could be especially effective for people suffering from damaged immune systems, including chemotherapy patients, who were protected from the toxic impacts of the treatment during the fasting period.  Flipping a “Regenerative Switch”  The researchers said that fasting helps the body’s stem cells to begin producing new white blood cells which help to fight off infection in the body.  “Fasting gives the ‘OK’ for stem cells to go ahead and begin proliferating and rebuild the entire system,” Prof. Valter Longo, Professor of Gerontology and the Biological Sciences at the University of Southern California, told the UK’s The Telegraph.  He added that the body actually removed parts that were damaged, old or inefficient during the fasting process, creating “literally, a new immune system.”  According to Dr. Longo a person’s system recycles unneeded immune cells, especially damaged ones, in order to create energy while they are fasting.  Over the course of his study’s trials, participants were asked to regularly fast between 2-4 days over a 6 month period.  The study was released in June and Dr. Longo said that clinical trials must still be completed, but added that the research looks “very promising.”  sources: telegraph, althealthworks, cell, medicalnewstoday, nationalpost, usc",other
154,"As the giant hydra-armed machine that is the snarling, lurching Biden campaign lumbers on towards the 2020 election, it has begun to drop all pretense of innocent operation. Holding virtual rallies, releasing a slew of negative ads across the airwaves nationwide, and selling facemasks emblazoned with images of the candidate’s face are just a few of the money-making schemes running for its benefit. But now, Joe Barron, head of the FBI’s Department of Detectivity says they’ve gone too far by accepting a check for thirty-one dollars from the organization called “Antifa.”  The donation, which arrived yesterday at campaign headquarters in Floppyballs, California, was confirmed to have been vetted by interns, and deposited into campaign coffers by Democrat volunteer Calypso Soros, a second cousin of the well-known billionaire. Barron detailed the possible actionable offense:  “Anything from Antifa is blood money, because they have been officially labelled an Anti-American organization by both Trumptards International and Diamond and Silk’s ‘Tents Can Be Clothes’ retail outlet stores. Accepting that money is the same as if you picked up a dollar on the street that a serial killer had dropped two days before. Sure, it seems innocent : but you’re still infected with evil. Biden might as well wear satanic cthulu robes and decapitate a chicken on top of Mother Theresa’s grave for what that thirty one dollars has done to his soul.”  So far, representitives of the Vice President’s campaign haven’t commented on what is sure to become a very serious scandal, but just like his rival Donald Trump, it will bloat and fester until one day it will no doubt explode in some Popeye’s chicken restroom.",other

156,"This is one in a series of articles taken from eyewitness testimony before the International Common Law Court of Justice in Brussels. Five international judges are examining evidence of child rape, torture, murder and kidnapping allegedly done by global elite members of the Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult network. Regular Ninth Circle child sacrifices were said to take place in the catacombs of Catholic Cathedrals, the Vatican, on private estates and groves and government military bases in Belgium, Holland, Spain, Australia, Ireland, France, England and the US. At least 34 child mass grave sites were identified in Ireland, Spain and Canada – and refused excavation by the respective governments, Crown of England and Catholic Church. Named as present in Ninth Circle activities were Pope Francis, former Pope Ratzinger;Anglican, United Church of Canada and Catholic Church officials including Cardinals; members of European royalty including Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip; officials of the Canadian, Australian, UK and US military and governments including the USA’s CIA, plus prominent government ministers, judges, politicians and businessmen from the US, Belgium, Holland, Canada, Australia, France, Ireland and the UK.  Teens were drugged, stripped naked, raped, hunted down in the woods and killed by European royals according to this week’s latest eyewitness to testify before the International Common Law Court of Justice in Brussels. The woman was the fourth eyewitness to give accounts about these human hunting parties of the global elite Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult network. A former member of the Netherlands criminal drug syndicate known as Octopus testified that victims were obtained for these human hunting parties from juvenile detention centers in Belgium and Holland.  “In 2004 I was an involuntary witness to torture, rape and murder sessions of drugged children performed for a group of high ranked people of the Netherlands” stated a woman. “I was taken to a hunting party in Belgium close to Brussels where I saw two boys and a girl ages 14 to 16, hunted and killed by global elites. The human hunting party was heavily guarded by the Netherlands Royal Guards. I was told that King Albert of Belgium was present.”  Four eyewitnesses confirmed that as children and youths they were forced to attend human hunting parties where they and other children were raped, with some killed, and deceased boy’s penises were cut off. Allegedly there was a Dutch countryside palace where boys’ penises were displayed like trophies on a wall. Some hunting parties were hosted on the grounds of Belgium Queen Beatrix’s Palace.  Dutch therapist Toos Nijenhuis claimed that as a four year-old she was forced to witness murders of children that involved former Pope Ratzinger, a Dutch Catholic Cardinal, plus the father of Netherlands Belgium Queen Beatrix and Bilderberger Founder, Dutch Crown Prince Alfrink Bernhard. “I saw the former Pope Joseph Ratzinger murder a little girl? another witness confirmed. “It was at a French chateau in the fall of 1987. It was ugly, horrible and didn’t happen just once. Ratzinger and Bernhard were some of the more prominent men who took part.”  In Ireland, Spain and Canada 34 child mass grave sites were discovered and appeared linked to Ninth Circle activities. The largest was the Mohawk Indian Residential School in Brantford Ontario where child remains were identified in 2008 before the Catholic Church, Canadian government and English Crown shut down the dig by professional archeologists. The 2013 ICLCJ Court had found Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip guilty for the Oct. 10 1964 disappearance of ten native children from the Catholic residential school in Kamloops British Columbia. In the first two weeks of the 2014 court witnesses identified Dutch and Belgian royal participants in the rape and killing of Mohawk children and newborns. Named were Bernhard and King Hendrick, consort to Queen Wilhelmina of Holland.  Alleged to be present during the human hunting parties were the late Prince Johan Friso and his wife Mabel Wisse Smit, former ministers, the top man of the Dutch army, the under secretary of the Raad Van State in the Netherlands, the Vice-Roy next to Queen Beatrix and other global business and political leaders including some from the US. “Surely the present King Willem Alexander and King Filip and their wives know about this abuse and murder of children” said one eyewitness.”They do nothing about it and likely are the ones to stop investigations and prosecutions.”  In January 2014 the brother of the king of Holland Prince Johan Friso passed away in a coma after these three Dutch-language websites shown here reached the internet. The websites revealed that Friso was at the human hunting and killing parties.”The story came on the internet after years of trying to move the policy and justice department in the Netherlands to act against the criminals,” an eyewitness said. “Nobody did anything to stop these criminals, probably because Queen Beatrix and King Albert likely interfered with the investigations.”  Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.  Human hunting parties were said to take place on the grounds of Belgium Queen Beatrix’s Palace in the Netherlands. Two witnesses have named former Pope Joseph Ratzinger and Queen Beatrix’s father the deceased Prince Alfrink Bernhard, as being present at child sacrifices. Both were said to be Nazi sympathizers.  The ICLCJ Court received a collection of Jesuit archival records about a child sacrificial cult known as the Knights of Darkness. In 1933 the Knights were established by the Catholic Jesuits and Nazi Waffen S.S. Division. The records showed Ratzinger was identified as a member of the Knights while working as an S.S. Chaplain’s assistant at the Ravensbruck Concentration Camp in Germany. The records also stated that Ratzinger participated in child sacrificial rites using kidnapped children from the camps or political prisoners.  Another court document called the Magisterial Privilege indicated child sacrifice was a regular occurrence at the Vatican. At the tender age of 12 “Svali” of San Diego County California claimed she was brought to catacombs beneath the Vatican to witness the sacrifice of a three year-old drugged boy. In this video her interviewer said that 24 years prior a “Maria” told him she witnessed another satanic child sacrifice rite in the same Vatican Catacombs.  Last week an Irish police investigator reported to the ICLCJ Court that the close to 800 babies buried in a Catholic Nun’s septic tank were dismembered, decapitated and in bits and pieces – signs that they could have been murdered in Satanic child sacrifice rites. In the last two months the ICLCJ Court has heard these heart-wrenching testimonies about the rape, torture and murder of children as recently as 2010 by Catholic leaders, European royal family members and other global elites. Murder sites of the Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult were said to be in the catacombs of Catholic Cathedrals including the Vatican and on private estates, military establishments and groves in Belgium, Holland, Spain, Australia, France, England and the US.  The ICLCJ Court has been overwhelmed with newly discovered evidence and a number of new witnesses coming forward to testify about Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult activities. They have uncovered Ninth Circle Satanic Cult member possible involvement in international child sacrifice, kidnapping, exploitation and drug rings. The five international judges and 27 jury members were expected to remain in session for at least a year due to the complexity of the cases.  Amnesty has been offered to citizens or employees of the Vatican, Crown of England, churches or governments willing to give sworn testimony or evidence that leads to the prosecution of these global elites suspected of committing crimes. Rewards up to 10,000 euros or around 13,660 dollars was available through the ICLCJ court.  The ICLCJ Court had over 450 Common Law Peace Officers in 13 countries, with 51 local chartered groups operating. Local organizing funds were available for common law groups that applied through the International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State.

Preventing is obviously easier than treating severe illness.  But treat serious illness seriously. Do not hesitate to seek medical attention. It is not an either-or choice. Vitamin C can be used right along with medicines when they are indicated.  “I have not seen any flu yet that was not cured or markedly ameliorated by massive doses of vitamin C.” Robert F. Cathcart, MD  The physicians of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service and the International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine urge a nutrient-based method to prevent or minimize symptoms for future viral infection. The following inexpensive supplemental levels are recommended for adults; for children reduce these in proportion to body weight:  Vitamin C: 3,000 milligrams or more daily, in divided doses.  Vitamin D3: 2,000 International Units daily. Start with 5,000 IU/day for two weeks, then reduce to 2,000  Magnesium: 400 mg daily in citrate, malate, chelate, or chloride form  Zinc: 20 mg daily  Selenium: 100 mcg micrograms daily  Vitamin C [1] , Vitamin D [2] , magnesium [3] , zinc [4] , and selenium [5] have been shown to strengthen the immune system against viruses.  The basis for using high doses of vitamin C to prevent and combat virus-caused illness may be traced back to vitamin C’s early success against polio, first reported in the late 1940s. [6] Many people are unaware, even surprised, to learn this. Further clinical evidence built up over the decades, leading to an anti-virus protocol published in 1980. [7]  It is important to remember that preventing and treating respiratory infections with large amounts of vitamin C is well established. Those who believe that vitamin C generally has merit, but massive doses are ineffective or somehow harmful, will do well to read the original papers for themselves. To dismiss the work of these doctors simply because they had success so long ago sidesteps a more important question: Why has the benefit of their clinical experience not been presented to the public by responsible governmental authorities, especially in the face of a viral pandemic?

161,"Net migration could fall by about 100,000 a year if the UK leaves the EU and introduces work permits for EU citizens, a pressure group has said.  Migration Watch says this would cut net migration - the difference between the number of people arriving and leaving - from 180,000 to 65,000 a year.  But James McGrory, from the pro-EU Britain Stronger In Europe campaign, called the report disingenuous.  He said it was another example of fudging the facts.      Follow the latest updates with BBC Politics Live  The UK is set to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether or not it should remain a member of the European Union.  The report from Migration Watch, which advocates tighter immigration controls, looks at possible policies that could be introduced if the UK voted to leave the EU and considers their impact on overall migration figures. lineimage copyrightNot Specified Analysis The Union Jack flag next to the European Flagimage copyrightReuters image captionThe Conservatives have promised to hold an in/out referendum on the EU by the end of 2017  BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw  No-one knows for sure what impact a British exit from the EU would have on immigration.  It would depend on the terms of a new settlement that might take months to negotiate and years to put into place.  But say, as Migration Watch advocates, that it did herald controls on the flow of low-skilled EU migrant labour, would that really work in reducing net migration?  Wouldn't there be an influx of migrants from the EU before the restrictions came into force?  Wouldn't businesses that currently rely on labourers, chambermaids and supermarket shelf-stackers from Europe demand that they be allowed to recruit them from elsewhere?  And wouldn't the EU introduce work permits for British workers, thereby reducing emigration from the UK?  These are questions that need answers in the months leading up to the referendum. lineimage copyrightNot Specified 'Pressure on services'  The report suggested the key change could be the introduction of work permits which would limit EU nationals entering the country to higher-skilled workers, their family members and students, while low-skilled workers would not be granted entry.  Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch, said: It is time to examine possible alternative immigration regimes.  Under the current arrangements, signs indicated migration to Britain would continue at a substantial rate for the foreseeable future, he said.  Indeed, immigrants tend to generate further migration as their friends and relatives join them in their new countries, he said.  Work permits for EU citizens would substantially reduce net migration and its resultant pressure on our population and public services.  The 16-page paper suggests that on average only about 20% of EU migrants who came to Britain between 2004 and 2014 were doing higher-skilled work.  It said: This could substantially reduce the EU inflow for work to perhaps one fifth of its recent level and would, in turn, substantially reduce net migration by perhaps 100,000 a year from the current level of 180,000. Graph showing long-term international migration to the UK  The figures should not be taken as a precise estimate but were intended to illustrate the scale of the potential reduction under the policy outlined, it said.  There would be no need for restrictions on EU citizens coming to the UK as students or tourists, the authors concluded.  Those who are self-sufficient would also be free to live in Britain, including those who are looking for jobs. 'No evidence'  Under the suggested system there would also be no restriction on EU family members of British citizens coming to join them, while relatives of European skilled workers and students would have the right to live and work in the UK.  Those EU citizens already living and working in the UK would retain their existing rights, Migration Watch suggested.  However, pro-EU campaigner Mr McGrory said: Right now, Britain has the best of both worlds. We have an opt-out from the passport-free Schengen area, while still enjoying full access to the single market.  The Leave campaigns haven't produced a shred of evidence to show how they could guarantee a deal that is at least as good if we left.  The Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said if it became harder for employers to recruit EU workers they may try to bring in more migrants from outside Europe.  Most recent estimated net migration to the UK reached a record 336,000 in the year to June 2015 according to Office for National Statistics ONS figures  ",other
162,"May 28, 2020  New Research Study Clarifies Health Outcomes in Vaccinated versus Unvaccinated Children  Print  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE – May 28, 2020  Contact:  Unvaccinated children are less likely to be diagnosed with developmental delays, asthma, and ear infections.  Redding CA— A new peer-reviewed study in the journal SAGE Open Medicine details the health outcomes of vaccinated versus unvaccinated children from three pediatric practices in the United States concludes that unvaccinated children have better health outcomes than their vaccinated peers.  Children in the study were followed continuously for a minimum of 3 years from birth. The study was based on medical records of over 2000 children enrolled in three pediatric practices and born between November 2005 and June 2015. Vaccination status was determined based on any vaccination received prior to one year of age which yielded 30.9% of the children in the unvaccinated group. Results show that vaccination before one year of age led to significantly increased odds of medical diagnoses of developmental delays, asthma and ear infections in children.  In a separate analysis, based on the number of vaccines received by one year of age, children receiving more vaccines were more likely to be diagnosed with gastrointestinal disorders compared to those who received no vaccines within the same timeframe. In temporal analyses, children vaccinated prior to six months of age showed significant risks of each of the disorders studied as compared to unvaccinated children in the same timeframe.  The study, coauthored by Dr. Brian Hooker and Mr. Neil Miller, is unique in that all diagnoses were verified using abstracted medical records from each of the participating pediatric practices. Lead author of the study, Dr. Hooker, stated, “The results definitely indicate better health outcomes in children who did not receive vaccines within their first year of life. These findings are consistent with additional research that has identified vaccination as a risk factor for a variety of adverse health outcomes . Such findings merit additional large-scale study of vaccinated and unvaccinated children in order to provide optimal health as well as protection against infectious diseases.”  ###",other
163,"Dave Janda of Operation Freedom www.DaveJanda.com has unleashed a bombshell story with huge implications for Tuesday’s elections. Janda’s guest in his latest broadcast is a former high-level intelligence official Lt. Gen. Tom McInerney who warns that the Dems and the CIA have put in place a mechanism which can alter the voting results of electronic voting machines in key swing states like Pennsylvania that will determine the outcome of the election.  This covert technology is called Operation Scorecard, and it was built by the CIA to surreptitiously steal elections in targeted countries. Now, that technology is being turned against the United States of America and is about to be activated on Tuesday to steal the election for Biden, explains Janda’s guest.  OmegaManRadio, a pro-liberty, pro-Christian podcast channel, has reposted portions of the Dave Janda interview at this link on Soundcloud.com. Start listening around the 20 minute mark to hear the bombshell segments.  The original interview from Dave Janda is currently available via YouTube but is likely to be blacklisted soon. Here’s the YouTube embed:  As McInerney explains in the video, after the closing of polls in Pennsylvania and other swing states, the voting machines will be intercepted and then altered using complex algorithms to alter the votes in a way that evades detection, handing a victory to the pre-designated “winner” Joe Biden.  Smells like FREEDOM. Order Founders Blend Organic Coffee from Freedom First Coffee. Use NOQ as the promo code for 10% off!  In the interview, he explains that a covert app called “Scorecard” steals votes by making sure Democrats always stay about 3% ahead of their Republican rivals. “Scorecard steals the elections by tampering with the computers at the transfer points,” he adds.  This also explains why Joe Biden recently said, with great clarity, “We have put together I think the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics.”  Here’s the video of Biden bragging about the massive voter fraud system that’s being used to try to to steal the election for him:  This might also help explain why Joe Biden told voters at a recent small rally that he didn’t “need their vote” to become President, and why Nancy Pelosi says Biden will win no matter what the votes say on Nov. 3rd.  The deep state has a plan in place to steal this election by altering votes in key swing states. And if Trump challenges the fraud, he will be condemned for “refusing to accept the outcome” of the rigged election. This is the narrative trap that has been set by the treasonous mainstream media.  Keep in mind that just over the last two days, Trump campaign officials were asking for detailed information about how voting machines are handled in Pennsylvania. According to the anti-Trump Washington Post a deep state propaganda mouthpiece:  …the Trump campaign asked officials in Cumberland County for the names of people who transport ballots and voting machines once polls close, the names of people who have access to the ballots afterward, and the precise locations where the ballots are stored, including room numbers.  It seems that Trump’s people are already aware that Dems are working to fraudulently steal this election by altering votes in Pennsylvania, and they’re trying to stop it.  Be aware that unless Trump receives an overwhelming wave of votes on Tuesday — beyond the margin of Democrat fraud — the Dems have a mechanism in place to steal the election, condemn Trump for challenging the vote theft, and seizing control of the White House from this day forward.  Spread this story far and wide. Everything is now at stake.

Paying the bills has never been my forte, but we’ve survived. We have ads on the site that help, but since the site’s inception this has been a labor of love that otherwise doesn’t bring in the level of revenue necessary to justify it.  When I left a nice, corporate career in 2017, I did so knowing I wouldn’t make nearly as much money. But what we do at NOQ Report to deliver the truth and fight the progressive mainstream media narrative that has plagued this nation is too important for me to sacrifice it for the sake of wealth. We know we’ll never make a ton of money this way, and we’re okay with that.  Things have become harder with the coronavirus lockdowns. Both ad money and donations that have kept us afloat for a while have dropped dramatically. We thought we could weather the storm, but the so-called “surge” or “2nd-wave” that mainstream media and Democrats are pushing has put our prospects in jeopardy.

The second way to help is to become a partner. We’ve strongly considered seeking angel investors in the past but because we were paying the bills, it didn’t seem necessary. Now, we’re struggling to pay the bills. This shouldn’t be the case as our traffic the last year has been going up dramatically. June, 2018, we had 11,678 visitors.

Ginger has helped many a cancer patient fend off nausea and inflammation during treatment. Now it appears it can do even more.  Loading...  In a Georga State University study on the effects of ginger extract on living cells, researchers found that ginger extract induced growth-inhibition and death on cancerous cells, while leaving the healthy cells alone.  Ginger was found found to have virtually no side effects, which separates it from modern-day chemotherapy. Some forms of chemotherapy have actually been found to increase the rate of metastasis, causing cancer to appear in other organs that were unrelated to the organ being treated.  “Whatever manipulations we’re doing to tumors can inadvertently do something to increase the tumor numbers to become more metastatic, which is what kills patients at the end of the day,” said Dr. Raghu Kalluri, working on an unrelated study at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.  At George State, the researchers found that ginger extract shrunk prostate tumors in mice by 56%, while reducing inflammation and providing anti-oxidants.  This study comes in addition to 17 other studies linking ginger to anti-cancer benefits. The plant has also been subjected to peer-reviewed studies that link it to healing when dealing with over 101 other diseases.

165,"To say out-loud that you find the results of the 2020 presidential election odd is to invite derision. You must be a crank or a conspiracy theorist. Mark me down as a crank, then. I am a pollster and I find this election to be deeply puzzling. I also think that the Trump campaign is still well within its rights to contest the tabulations. Something very strange happened in America’s democracy in the early hours of Wednesday November 4 and the days that followed. It’s reasonable for a lot of Americans to want to find out exactly what.  First, consider some facts. President Trump received more votes than any previous incumbent seeking reelection. He got 11 million more votes than in 2016, the third largest rise in support ever for an incumbent. By way of comparison, President Obama was comfortably reelected in 2012 with 3.5 million fewer votes than he received in 2008.  Trump’s vote increased so much because, according to exit polls, he performed far better with many key demographic groups. Ninety-five percent of Republicans voted for him. He did extraordinarily well with rural male working-class whites.  Trump grew his support among black voters by 50 percent over 2016. Nationally, Joe Biden’s black support fell well below 90 percent, the level below which Democratic presidential candidates usually lose.  Trump increased his share of the national Hispanic vote to 35 percent. With 60 percent or less of the national Hispanic vote, it is arithmetically impossible for a Democratic presidential candidate to win Florida, Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico. Bellwether states swung further in Trump’s direction than in 2016. Florida, Ohio and Iowa each defied America’s media polls with huge wins for Trump. Since 1852, only Richard Nixon has lost the Electoral College after winning this trio, and that 1960 defeat to John F. Kennedy is still the subject of great suspicion.  Midwestern states Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin always swing in the same direction as Ohio and Iowa, their regional peers. Ohio likewise swings with Florida. Current tallies show that, outside of a few cities, the Rust Belt swung in Trump’s direction. Yet, Biden leads in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin because of an apparent avalanche of black votes in Detroit, Philadelphia, and Milwaukee. Biden’s ‘winning’ margin was derived almost entirely from such voters in these cities, as coincidentally his black vote spiked only in exactly the locations necessary to secure victory. He did not receive comparable levels of support among comparable demographic groups in comparable states, which is highly unusual for the presidential victor.  We are told that Biden won more votes nationally than any presidential candidate in history. But he won a record low of 17 percent of counties; he only won 524 counties, as opposed to the 873 counties Obama won in 2008. Yet, Biden somehow outdid Obama in total votes.  Victorious presidential candidates, especially challengers, usually have down-ballot coattails; Biden did not. The Republicans held the Senate and enjoyed a ‘red wave’ in the House, where they gained a large number of seats while winning all 27 toss-up contests. Trump’s party did not lose a single state legislature and actually made gains at the state level.  Another anomaly is found in the comparison between the polls and non-polling metrics. The latter include: party registrations trends; the candidates’ respective primary votes; candidate enthusiasm; social media followings; broadcast and digital media ratings; online searches; the number of especially small donors; and the number of individuals betting on each candidate.  Despite poor recent performances, media and academic polls have an impressive 80 percent record predicting the winner during the modern era. But, when the polls err, non-polling metrics do not; the latter have a 100 percent record. Every non-polling metric forecast Trump’s reelection. For Trump to lose this election, the mainstream polls needed to be correct, which they were not. Furthermore, for Trump to lose, not only did one or more of these metrics have to be wrong for the first time ever, but every single one had to be wrong, and at the very same time; not an impossible outcome, but extremely unlikely nonetheless.  Atypical voting patterns married with misses by polling and non-polling metrics should give observers pause for thought. Adding to the mystery is a cascade of information about the bizarre manner in which so many ballots were accumulated and counted.  The following peculiarities also lack compelling explanations:  1. Late on election night, with Trump comfortably ahead, many swing states stopped counting ballots. In most cases, observers were removed from the counting facilities. Counting generally continued without the observers  2. Statistically abnormal vote counts were the new normal when counting resumed. They were unusually large in size hundreds of thousands and had an unusually high 90 percent and above Biden-to-Trump ratio  3. Late arriving ballots were counted. In Pennsylvania, 23,000 absentee ballots have impossible postal return dates and another 86,000 have such extraordinary return dates they raise serious questions  4. The failure to match signatures on mail-in ballots. The destruction of mail-in ballot envelopes, which must contain signatures  5. Historically low absentee ballot rejection rates despite the massive expansion of mail voting. Such is Biden’s narrow margin that, as political analyst Robert Barnes observes, ‘If the states simply imposed the same absentee ballot rejection rate as recent cycles, then Trump wins the election’  6. Missing votes. In Delaware County, Pennsylvania, 50,000 votes held on 47 USB cards are missing  7. Non-resident voters.

The news comes after a landmark ruling in October stated Uber drivers are employees, not self-employed as the company had claimed. The judgment could entitle thousands of “gig economy” workers to holiday pay and a guaranteed minimum wage.  The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain IWGB has demanded recognition from Deliveroo so that the union can bargain for pay and conditions on workers’ behalf. The deal will initially cover Camden in north London and will be rolled out nationwide if successful.  Recommended Read more Uber ordered to pay drivers minimum wage in landmark case  If half of drivers in the area sign up, Deliveroo will be forced to recognise the union. It will be the first collective bargaining agreement in the “gig economy”, setting a precedent for others to demand further rights.  Deliveroo has 10 business days to respond, after which an application will be submitted to the Central Arbitration Committee CAC asking it to force Deliveroo into collective bargaining.  IWGB general secretary Jason Moyer-Lee said: “Of course, for the CAC to entertain our request they will need to decide that Deliveroo drivers are ‘workers’ and not the ‘independent contractors’ you have bogusly deemed them to be,” Moyer-Lee said.  “Deliveroo drivers work for Deliveroo and as such they should be entitled to paid holiday, minimum wage, trade union rights, and all the other rights associated with worker status.”  Please enter your email address Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP Thanks for signing up to the News newsletter {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our privacy notice  Experts said the case could be hugely significant. Aaron Hayward, employment specialist at DJM Solicitors said it was “no surprise” the drivers were taking action after the Uber case.“The explosion of the gig economy means many thousands of workers across the UK are now engaged in temporary, casual work that doesn’t entitle them to paid holiday, minimum wage and other rights, because they are officially classified as ‘contractors’,” he said.  If the drivers are successful, Deliveroo will be the “first app-based employer to recognise a union in the UK. First they must succeed in convincing a tribunal that drivers should be reclassified as employees as opposed to contractors as collective bargaining laws only apply to employees.  “This is an employment case that employers, workers and lawyers alike will be watching with interest. As we move more towards a ‘gig economy’ based on short-term, software-driven casual work, this issue isn’t going to away anytime soon.”  Deliveroo delivers food from thousands of restaurants which do not have their own delivery service such as Pizza Express, Byron and Gourmet Burger Kitchen.  Drivers receive £3.75 per delivery under a new pilot scheme, but some have allege they wait up to an hour for a delivery, meaning their take-home pay is less than minimum wage. This is legal if the workers are self-employed, but many say it amounts to exploitation.

167,"Vaccine manufacturer Merck has abandoned development of two coronavirus vaccines, saying that after extensive research it was concluded that the shots offered less protection than just contracting the virus itself and developing antibodies. The company announced that the shots V590 and V591 were ‘well tolerated’ by test patients, however they generated an ‘inferior’ immune system response in comparison with natural infection. The company stated that instead it will focus on research into therapeutic drugs labeled as MK-7110 and MK-4482. The drugs aim to protect patients from the damage of an overactive immune response to the virus. “Interim results from a Phase 3 study showed a greater than 50 percent reduction in the risk of death or respiratory failure in patients hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19,” the company’s statement noted of the MK-7110 drug. Merck is to receive around $356 million from the US government to fast-track production of the potential treatments under Operation Warp Speed. Chief Marketing Officer Michael Nally recently told Bloomberg that Merck is aiming to produce some 20 million courses of the MK-4482 drug, an oral antiviral which patients will take twice a day for five days.

UK government ministers have suggested that the claim could be related to the ongoing dispute over delivery of the vaccine between the European Union and AstraZeneca.

And, if they are not true, then Merck should sue me. But Merck won’t do that. And they won’t do that because in the United States, truth is an absolute defense against slander.”  This must-watch video details the many problems with the development and safety of Merck’s third-highest grossing product, Gardasil. Children’s Health Defense CHD and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., CHD’s Chairman and Chief Legal Counsel, ask that you watch and share this video so that you, and others, may make an informed decision of whether or not to give your child, boy or girl, a Gardasil vaccine. It can also be a useful tool for pediatricians who are trying to understand how this vaccine, that is actually causing health problems with young people, could have been approved by FDA and then recommended by CDC. The video is full of jaw-dropping facts about Gardasil and the clinical trials leading up to its release upon an unsuspecting public.  Transcript of “The Science” presentation:  Download “The Science” Transcript  Children’s Health Defense and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—Science Day Presentation for Gardasil  Hi, I’m Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and I’m making this video for the sake of parents who are trying to make an informed decision of whether or not to give their child, their boy or girl the Gardasil vaccine.  I’m also making this video as a tool for pediatricians who are trying to understand how this vaccine—if it’s actually causing all of these problems with young girls—could have been approved by FDA and then mandated by CDC.  Virtually all of the things that I’m going to talk about in this video are available to the public on public documents as I’m going to show.  Finally, I want to say this about Merck which is the company that makes the Gardasil vaccine.  Many of the things that I’m going to say today would be slanderous if they were not true. And if they’re not true then Merck should sue me. But Merck won’t do that and they won’t do it because in the United States truth is an absolute defense to slander. And second of all Merck knows that if they sue me, I’m going to immediately file a discovery request, and many, many, more documents are going to emerge that illustrate even more fraud by this company on the American public and the people all over the world.  Finally, as a footnote I’m not going to talk today about the specific biological mechanisms that allow this vaccine to cause harm in human beings. That information is out there it’s in dozens of peer-reviewed, published scientific documents. Many of these are described on our website and I urge people to go to the Children’s Health Defense website to educate themselves on those issues.  Today we’re going to talk about the clinical trial about Merck’s fraud in that process…and this is Merck’s claim:  The HPV vaccine will “eliminate cervical cancers and other HPV associated cancers.”  The danger of dying from HPV cancer in this country is 1 death in 43.5 thousand people.  Imagine you have a deck of cards but instead of 50 cards. There’s 43,500 on a on a big, big table and one of those cards is a black card. If you get that, you die.  So, Merck’s deal is that it’s going to remove that black card from the deck. But in order to play the game and make sure that Merck removes the black card, everybody who participates has to put in $420 because that’s the cost of the three-dose Gardasil vaccine.  So, here’s Gardasil by the numbers. So, the cost of the three-jab series average is about $420. There are 76 million children who essentially have been mandated by CDC to receive these vaccines. A blockbuster product from Merck, and global revenues from this vaccine today are about $2.3 billion dollars. It’s the third largest product in the company’s inventory.  The cost of saving one American life is 18.3 million dollars. People could argue whether or not that’s a reasonable value of a human life. What I would say was is that the criteria that we should use for evaluating reasonableness—is there a cheaper way to save more lives? And people would argue that Pap smears are the most effective way that 80 percent of cervical cancer deaths have already been eliminated by Pap smears. And this is the most effective technology.  Incidentally in another context HHS has already put a value on human life and the value is $250k. That is the maximum number that the vaccine compensation program will pay for killing an American citizen.  Prior to marketing the vaccine, the FDA licenses the vaccine, and in that licensing process Merck had to show that the vaccine was safe. According to Federal regulations the word “safety” means “relative freedom from harmful effects, taking into consideration the character of the product in relationship to the condition of the recipient at that time.”  So, what is the condition of the recipients of that target group for this vaccine. And this vaccine targets millions of preteens and teens, for whom the risk of dying from cervical cancer is practically zero. Cervical cancer’s median age of death is 58. It is first diagnosed at age 50 median.  A teenage girl or boy has zero chance of dying of this illness. Which means the threshold for giving this medication is very, very high.  Secondly it is mandated in some jurisdictions So the government is actually—government officials are actually—coming in and ordering people to take this medical intervention. So, we have to be sure that the threshold for risk, “the risk profile” for that medical intervention should be very, very low.  Third, unlike other medical interventions Gardasil recipients are perfectly healthy. So, when you give medication to a healthy individual you have to make sure that the risk profile is practically zero. And in order to determine risk, there is a standardized protocol. And it’s called double-blind placebo studies. What does that mean?  It means that the drug company that’s trying to license this product gives the medication to one group of people, maybe 5,000 or 10,000 people, and gives a placebo, an inert placebo, either an identical looking pill that is inert—it’s either saline or sugar—to a similarly situated group of 5,000 or 10,000 people and it’s double blind meaning that neither the patients nor the researchers knew who got the placebo and who got the actual medication.  And you can see here, here’s what the NIH says about the National Institute for Health placebos: an inactive substance that looks like a drug.  So here are typical examples:  Lipitor was given during its study phase to about 17k subjects. Half of them received Lipitor half of them received a sugar pill that looked identical to Lipitor and they were observed and studied for up to 3.3 years.  Why for so long? Because many of the injuries that are caused by medication are latent—they don’t show up for two or three or four or five years cancer for example may not show up for four or five years after the exposure. Autoimmune diseases and allergies and these kind of things take a long time to diagnose. Enbrel for that reason was delayed for 6.6 years and against a control group that received a saline injection.  Botox, there was a national emergency to get Botox to market so people could get their wrinkles cured, was studied for 51 weeks and it was studied against a saline injection.  Now I’m going to show you one of the really outrageous frauds that Merck committed during the clinical trials. This is an insert that is part of every vaccine package. And you can go on the Internet right now and look up that Merck product and search and find these two tables.  In the initial table you can see a there are three columns and this is a table that just looks at injuries at the vaccine site for redness and itching and bruising and pain at the vaccine site and they use one…there were 5,000 girls—5,088 girls who got the Gardasil vaccine.  Number two, there were 3,470 girls who got the AAHS control, what is that? That is the adjuvant in the vaccine. That is a toxic neurotoxin, that’s put in the vaccine to make it more long-lasting to provoke an immune response in the subject of the vaccine.  And most people believe that it is that aluminum adjuvant that is causing all of these injuries in the girls who are getting the vaccine. And there were 3,470 people who received just the neurotoxin with no antigens and no other vaccine components.  And you have a third group which is the placebo group. What I want you to look at is at these numbers. That in the Gardasil and AAHS control there is virtually the same number of injuries.  And when you get to the saline placebo, that injury rate is cut in half.  Now let’s go to the table where they talk about real systemic injuries…autoimmune diseases, and instead of showing us real science, which is to show us what happened to the saline group, they hide the saline group as a way of fooling you, your pediatrician and the regulatory agency by compressing it into the aluminum group and they never tell us. They say this is a combination of the aluminum adjuvant and the saline placebo. They don’t tell us how many in each category were compressed there. The real thing that you need to watch here is what happened.  These are all very, very serious injuries. These are injuries that in some cases people would feel were worse than death—and that affect people and debilitate for a lifetime in many cases.  And if you look at the bottom of the Gardasil group an astonishing 2.3 percent of the girls in the clinical study who received the Gardasil vaccine got ill from autoimmune diseases, many within seven months of taking the vaccine.  And look what happened in the aluminum group—the same number exactly. 2.3 percent.  Nobody, no parent would allow their daughter to take a substance that had a one-in-40 chance of giving them a lifetime disability.  World Health Organization says that using a spiked placebo, or a faux-cebo as Merck did with Gardasil, puts you at a methodological disadvantage that “it may be difficult or impossible to assess vaccine safety.”  Dr. Stanley Plotkin, who developed the polio vaccine…who developed the pertussis vaccine, who developed the rotavirus vaccine—the Stanley Plotkin award is the Nobel Prize of vaccinology it’s given to the top vaccinologist every year—and what he says is:  Unless you have a true control group you are in LA LA LAND.  Finally, the American Medical Association says the absence of double-blind placebo testing and short-term studies of chronic disease are “the indicia of marketing masquerading as science.”  And that’s what Merck gave us.  The Cochrane Collaboration—thirty thousand scientists from all over the world who came together to create an independent assessment of medical protocols which they saw as being increasingly controlled by the industry—The Cochrane Collaboration said the use of active comparators probably increased the occurrence of harms and the comparative group thereby masking harms created by the HPV vaccine.  And that indeed was Merck’s point…to hide those harms.  So, if you do the math women are 100 times more likely to suffer serious adverse events from the Gardasil vaccine than they are to be protected from cervical cancer.  So now we have a very different bargain in this card game that we’re playing with Merck.  If 43 thousand cards and the black card—the death card is gone—but now, there are a thousand blue cards which if you pick one of those by mistake you have a good chance of getting an autoimmune disease. Nobody would take that bargain.  So, in order to get the FDA license to market this vaccine Merck did a number of studies, which are called protocols. We don’t know how many they did because they’re not telling us they never disclosed it.  The one we’re most concerned with is protocol 18. The reason protocol 18 is critical is because that was the basis for FDA giving Merck the license to produce and market the vaccine.  Why is that? Because protocol 18 is the only one in which the target audience for this vaccine. 11- and 12-year old girls was actually tested, and had a control group. The other ones looked at big cohorts of women were 16 to 25-year old and 16 to 26-year old women.  Protocol 18 looked at girls and boys from ages 9 to 15. It was a total of 1200 children. and almost 600 controls. That is a very, very, tiny group of people to study in order to determine the safety of a product is going to be marketed to billions of children around the world.  Now I’m going to show you one of the key fraudulent flimflams that Merck used to get this license. FDA said they approved Gardasil based on protocol 18 because protocol 18 was of particular interest because it’s the only protocol in which Merck used a true saline placebo instead of the aluminum adjuvant as a control.  That’s what Merck told FDA and the CDC but Merck was lying. It actually did not use a true saline placebo. It used what Merck called the “carrier solution.” Which is all of the components of the vaccine except for the aluminum and the viral particles the antigen.  Among the compounds that we know were in the carrier solution are Polysorbate 80 which we have no idea what the safety profile is because it’s never been tested for safety independently in vaccines. Sodium borate which is borax which is banned by FDA in food products and all food products in the United States, and is banned altogether in Europe, genetically modified yeast, there’s no safety test ever been done on it in vaccines L-histidine, the same, and possibly DNA fragments.  I say possibly because we know there are DNA fragments in the final vaccine, we don’t know how they got there. And Merck has lied about the DNA fragments from the outset.  And despite these potentially toxic components of compounds that are in the vaccine, the 596 children that were given the carrier solution fared much better in the other than any other cohort in the study. The girls and boys who receive the carrier solution were the only significant cohorts with no serious adverse events for the first 15 days.  And here’s another one of the gravamen of the fraud that Merck committed in its Gardasil trials, but it turns out in the protocol 18 study, it appears Merck cut the amount of aluminum that was given to the vaccine group in half. They tested a completely different formulation. If true, we theorize that they took the aluminum out to reduce the number of injuries and to mask the really bad safety profile of this vaccine.  And since the protocol 18 data are not based on the Gardasil vaccine formulation, the trial itself constitutes rank scientific fraud.  Here’s another bag of tricks that was used by Merck in order to skew the clinical trials results in favor of Gardasil.  Merck and its researchers use what they call exclusion criteria—for example people who had zero allergies, people who had prior genital infections were thrown out of the clinical trials. People who had over four sex partners in their entire lives were excluded from the trials. Anybody who had a history of immunological or nervous system disorders, people with chronic illnesses and seizure disorders, people with other medical conditions, people who had reactions to vaccine ingredients including the aluminum, yeast and the benzonase. or anybody with a history of alcohol and drug abuse.  If you really wanted to know whether the vaccine was helping people—if it was effective—wouldn’t you want those people in your study wouldn’t you want people who had a genetic vulnerability to cancer in your study to see if it actually was capable of preventing cancer.  Then Merck had one catch all exclusion category which was any condition which in the opinion of the investigator might interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives. Well, that gave Merck and its paid investigators complete control to throw people out of the study who they thought might make the study look not successful. All of these exclusionary categories gave Merck the ability to limit the study to people who were like All of these exclusionary categories gave Merck the ability to limit this study to people who were like an elite club of superheroes…the people who get the vaccine are not the same people they tested on. They tested it on the Avengers. They didn’t test it on, you know, Joe Bag-of-Donuts … the people are actually receiving this vaccine in day to day life. And by doing that they were able to mask whatever injury might show up in a larger and more vulnerable population who are actually receiving the vaccine.  Experts used an arsenal of sloppy protocols to again, hide vaccine injuries. Among these, Merck gave report cards—the daily journal report cards— only to 10 percent of the people who they tested the vaccine on and told those people only make reports for 14 days after the injection. And the report cards were only designed to collect jab site information. So, redness, itching, bruising, fever.  And they ignored altogether the autoimmune diseases and menstrual cycle problems and fertility problems and pain and dizziness and seizures and all of the other things that we’ve now seen are associated with the vaccine. In fact, there are numerous girls who report that they were injured that they attempted to report those injuries to Merck, and that Merck rebuffed them.  Furthermore, Merck gave extraordinary discretion to its researchers to determine what was a vaccine injury in what was not a vaccine injury and because there was no inert placebo, it was completely within their discretion. If a girl came back with seizures or autoimmune disease or menstrual cycle problems they could just say to the girl, well that’s not related to the vaccine.  In some cases, we know that Merck actively covered up and lied about injuries that it had a duty to report to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. For example, in the case of Christina Tarsell, a Maryland girl, who died from the Gardasil vaccine, Merck lied about that death in its official reports of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. It told the system that Christina’s doctor had told Merck that her death was the result of a virus.  And the doctor adamantly denies that. Merck has refused to remove the misinformation from the VAERS system.  Furthermore, Merck lied to the girls who participated in these studies, telling them No.1, that the placebo was saline and that it contained no other ingredients. And No. 2, that the study in which they were participating was not a safety study. They were told that there had already been safety studies and that the vaccine had been proven safe.  What did this do for Merck? It made it so the girls were less likely to report injuries associated with the vaccine. Because they believed that the vaccine that they were receiving had already been proven safe and that any injuries they did experience maybe a month or two months or three months after the vaccine must be simply coincidental and had nothing to do with the vaccine.  Despite all of these efforts by Merck to discourage those from reporting vaccine injuries during the clinical trials, half of the girls in the Gardasil group and half of them in the aluminum adjuvant group reported serious injuries after receiving the vaccine.  In order to conceal the link between these injuries and the vaccine, Merck invented a brand new medical metric that had never been heard of before called “new medical conditions” and it dismissed all of these new injuries which affected 50 percent of the girls who received the vaccine and the adjuvant as “new medical conditions”, unrelated to the vaccines, simply sad coincidences.  Many of these diseases were serious diseases—blood lymphatic diseases, anemia, endocrine diseases, autoimmune diseases, G.I., Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, vaginal infections musculoskeletal injuries, arthritis, neoplasm, Hodgkin’s disease, neurological diseases, psychiatric diseases, depression, reproductive and breast disorders, menstrual irregularities, and pain. Over 3 percent of the girls—1 in 30—in both groups required surgical and medical procedures.  So, this card game that we’re playing with Merck has now become a really bad bet.  Merck has removed the one black card but you now have a 1 in 40 chance of drawing a blue card and getting an autoimmune disease that may afflict you for the rest of your life and you have a 1 in 2 chance of having some other serious medical condition.  So now let’s look at Merck’s central claim which is that the Gardasil vaccine will prevent cervical cancer.  Merck’s in a sweet position here, let’s face it because the target group vaccine is 11-year olds, and the median age of death for cervical cancer is age 58. Merck essentially is making this bargain.  It’s telling the 11-year old girl if you take our vaccine 47 years from now you won’t die of cervical cancer. And of course, that truth is you can’t make a vaccine that proves that it’s going to prevent cancer 47 years from now. There’s no way to test for that.  So, Merck used a shortcut. It said we’re going to prove that it prevents these what it called surrogate end points. The best thing that Merck had come up with was CIN2 and CIN3 lesions which it called precancerous lesions even though most of those lesions never mature into cancer.  So how can you call something precancerous when it was never going to turn into cancer?  And here’s what a study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology said about Merck’s scheme: CIN3 is an imperfect diagnosis of precancer, and an intermediate surrogate for cancer.  Their own attorneys told them for these products, the indication is the surrogate, not the ultimate. Promotion cannot make any claim, vis-a-vis the ultimate end point, based upon the fate of a surrogate endpoint.  Merck has another problem. Recent peer reviewed scientific studies indicate that perhaps only a third of cervical cancer cases are even associated with the HPV vaccine. That would completely put the lie to Merck’s claims that Gardasil is going to eliminate cervical cancer altogether.  So now we have a really dubious deal because we need to put that black card back in the deck because now, we have doubts about whether or not this vaccine can prevent cervical cancer at all.  But the news gets worse. Gardasil may actually cause cancer. Gardasil’s insert states Gardasil has never been evaluated for potential to cause carcinogenicity or genotoxicity. And Gardasil’s ingredients include possible carcinogens including human DNA.  And look at this…This is Merck’s own pre-clinical trial records and those records show that girls or women, who already had HPV—had been exposed at some point in their life to it—actually had a negative efficacy of 44.6 percent.  What is negative efficacy? It means those girls had a 44.6 increased risk of getting those precancerous lesions. To make things even worse, there are recent scientific studies that suggest a phenomena of what is known as type replacement—some 200 different strands of HPV, some of them are more cancerous than others, and the current HPV vaccine goes after 9 of those 200 viral types. What these studies indicate is by eliminating those particular strains of the virus it opens up an ecological niche in the woman so that more lethal and virulent viruses can actually colonize that spot and dramatically increase the risk of cervical cancer.  So now Merck’s deal is looking really grim. Not only do we have a one-in-40 chance of getting an autoimmune disease and a 50 percent chance of getting some serious medical condition but now the cancer risk has been reinserted and actually amplified.  And now let’s look at some of the non-cancer injuries that Merck found in its preclinical studies.  The miscarriage rate in the preclinical studies after Gardasil doubled the background rate. The birth defects in the Gardasil group were five times the rate of birth defects from the control group. As to reproductive disorders an astonishing 10.9 percent of the women in the pool group reported reproductive disorders within seven months of receiving Gardasil compared to 1.2 percent in the placebo group. The death rate in the Gardasil group and the clinical trials was 8.5 per 10 thousand.  Death risk from this vaccine according to Merck’s own studies is 37 times the risk of dying from cervical cancer.  Oh, now look at the deal that Merck has offered us they’ve actually increased our risk of dying by 37 times.  So now let’s look at post-licensing surveillance. So, Merck can argue that we might have missed something in our pre-licensing studies but surely if there were any injuries being caused by this vaccine we would see them in post-licensing surveillance.  And the problem with that is that the post-licensing surveillance system, the principle one, is called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. The system is a voluntary system that simply does not work. It’s broken. In fact, in 2010 HHS hired another federal agency the agency for healthcare research quality and a group of Harvard researchers to study Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and those researchers found fewer than 1 percent of adverse events of vaccines are ever reported.  But even under that system, Gardasil has distinguished itself as the most dangerous vaccine ever invented.  In fact, when you compare it to Menactra which is a meningitis vaccine that’s given to the same age group—teenagers—Gardasil had an 8.5 times more emergency room visits, 12.5 times more hospitalizations, 10 times more life-threatening events and 26.5 times more disabilities than Menactra.  The vaccine court which is within HHS has made awards for numerous deaths and very, very serious injuries from the Gardasil vaccine. So, HHS itself admits that this vaccine kills people and it’s given compensation to the families that were injured.  The same wave of serious injuries and deaths that have been seen in nations around the globe, when they adopt mandates for the Gardasil vaccine. Even Gardasil’s own insert, the package insert that the company provides, acknowledges that the injuries that can be caused by this vaccine include death, pancreatitis, fatigue, malaise, immune system disorders, autoimmune diseases, anaphylaxis, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, nervous system disorders, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, that’s brain injuries, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and other neuron diseases, paralysis, seizures, Transverse myelitis, and vascular disorders.  In Australia, in 2015, the Australian Department of Health Therapeutic Goods Administration reported that the adverse rates in girls is 17 times the incidental rate for cervical cancer throughout their lifespan. The country only looked at a handful of conditions including demyelinating disorders, complex regional pain syndrome and premature ovarian failure. There are many, many other injuries that included hospitalizations that were not subject to that study.  India suspended its Gardasil trials after numerous deaths and serious injuries.  A south Asian Journal of Cancer found that “a healthy 16-year old is at zero immediate risk of dying from cervical cancer but is faced with a small, but real risk of death or serious disability from a vaccine that has yet to prevent a single case of cervical cancer.”  Japan de-recommended Gardasil three months after it had added the vaccine to the immunization schedule. Japan’s health ministry discovered adverse events reported after Gardasil’s approval were many times higher than other vaccines on the recommended schedule—these included seizures severe headaches partial paralysis complex regional pain syndrome and an undeniable causal relationship between persistent pain and the vaccination.  Japanese researchers found that the adverse event rate for the HPV vaccine was as high as nine percent and that pregnant women injected with the vaccine aborted or miscarried 30 percent of their babies.  In 2015 the Japanese Association for Medical Sciences issued official guidelines for managing symptoms of injuries caused by the Gardasil vaccine and the association announced there was no proof that this vaccine even prevents cervical cancer.  Alarmingly Merck’s own studies indicate that the Gardasil vaccine may disproportionately impact Asian women. For example, in protocol 19 there were 8 deaths among 3800 women and 7 those were Asians. That was 87 percent for Asian women, while only 31 percent of study participants were Asian.  Denmark in 2015 announced the opening of five new HPV clinics to treat women who were injured by the Gardasil vaccine. The day that they announced that opening there were 1300 applicants for treatment in those clinics.  In Colombia in 2014 800 girls in the town Carmen de Bolivar were grievously injured by Gardasil vaccine. Protests erupted all over Columbia. The attorney general of Colombia ordered the National Health Service of that country to immediately begin treating girls who were injured by the Gardasil vaccine and 2017 Colombia’s highest Constitutional Court ruled that the HPV vaccine would no longer be considered mandatory in Colombia and ordered that girls who showed symptoms after receiving the vaccine be given appropriate medical care.  Pompilio Martinez, who now teaches at the National University of Colombia, described the HPV vaccine as “a crime against humanity.”  Recent studies have shown that in nations with robust HPV vaccination programs and heavily vaccinated populations—in the UK and Sweden and Australia—were actually seeing dramatic upticks rises in the rate of cervical cancer rather than the downtrends that Merck promised everybody.  Now I’m going to show you some of the reasons why your pediatrician is insisting despite all of this evidence that your daughter or son gets the HPV vaccine. And the reason is the pediatrician is getting his information from agencies that have compromised through financial entanglements with Merck.  This is what the FDA is telling the public about vaccine safety: it says that vaccines are regulated by FDA and undergo a rigorous review of laboratory and clinical data to ensure the safety efficacy and purity and potency of these products.  But this is a very different story the FDA is acknowledging in-house, and this comes from a 2007 document—this is the year that Gardasil got its license from the FDA, FDA’s inability to keep up with scientific advances mean that American lives are at risk. FDA is evaluations and methods have remained largely unchanged over the last half century. The world looks to FDA as a leader today. Not only can the agency not lead, it cannot even keep up with the advances in science.  But, the most troubling problem at FDA is it has nothing to do with incompetence. It has to do with corruption. The panel within FDA that licenses new vaccines and anoints them as safe is called the Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, the acronym is VRBPAC. And in 2000 Congress investigated VRBPAC because of charges of corruption from outside the agency.  And here’s what the congressional committee found: the overwhelming majority of members, both voting members and consultants have substantial ties to the pharmaceutical industry.  Conflicts of interest rules employed by FDA have been weak enforcement has been lax. Committee members with substantial ties to pharmaceutical companies are given waivers to participate in committee proceedings. In many cases significant conflicts of interest are deemed to be in conflict at all.  And here are some specific examples of the conflict of the advisory committee that approves vaccines:  Three out of five FDA advisory committee members who voted to approve the rotavirus vaccine in December of 1997 had financial ties to the pharmaceutical companies that were developing different versions of the vaccine.  One of the five voting members had a 9 plus million dollar contract for a rotavirus vaccine.  One of the five voting members was the principal investigator for a Merck grant to develop the rotavirus vaccine.  One of the five voting members received approximately a million dollars from vaccine manufacturers toward vaccine development.  Once they get by FDA, vaccine companies then go to CDC, where another committee, which is called ACIP Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, will then take that vaccine that FDA has licensed and they will put it on the recommended list which means it becomes essentially mandatory for 76 million American children.  A listing on CDC’s recommended list is the holy grail for vaccine companies. It ",other
170,"There’s not much to laugh about these days, but the news that smokers might be protected from Covid-19 is certainly one of them. With study after study showing that smokers are under-represented in coronavirus wards, the renowned French neuroscientist, Jean-Pierre Changeux, is working on a randomised control trial to test the effect of nicotine patches on Covid-19 patients.  These groups are so used to lying with impunity that they wasted no time in asserting that smoking caused coronavirus complications when the pandemic began. In the US, newspapers have been filled with reports that smokers and vapers ‘may’ be at greater risk from Covid-19, a weasel word that requires no evidence. A group of doctors in New York urged governor Andrew Cuomo to ban the sale of all tobacco and e-cigarette products on the false premise that ‘mounting evidence demonstrates the link between tobacco use and increased risk for progressive Covid-19’. Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation has been taking occasional breaks from flattering the Chinese Communist Party to make evidence-free assertions about smokers being ‘likely’ to suffer more from the coronavirus.  This is far from being a crackpot theory. Changeux has explained his hypothesis at length here . In simple terms, he says that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors play a key role in the development of the disease and that nicotine can put a brake on it. If he is right – and the banter heuristic says he is – it would not only save thousands of lives but would also be one in the eye for the ‘public health’ groups who have been claiming that smoking and vaping are risk factors for Covid-19.  Three weeks ago, Public Health England fished around in the emerging literature and found a study from China involving a grand total of five smokers hospitalised with Covid-19, of whom three suffered severe symptoms. From this crumb of evidence, they made the astounding claim that ‘smokers with Covid-19 are 14 times more likely to develop severe respiratory disease’.  A few days earlier, a group of doctors from the Royal Glamorgan Hospital had written to the British Medical Journal to point out that nicotine protects against the kind of acute inflammatory reactions seen in Covid patients and that ‘the simple use of nicotine patches should be urgently considered and discussed’. Nobody paid much attention, but evidence supporting the smoking hypothesis continued to slip out.  Dr Konstantinos Farsalinos of the University of Patras in Greece noticed this phenomenon early on and put a preliminary study online in late March. It noted the ‘unusually low prevalence of current smoking was observed among hospitalised Covid-19 patients’, which ‘does not support the argument that current smoking is a risk factor for hospitalisation for Covid-19, and might suggest a protective role’.  The most comprehensive epidemiological study appeared a week later. Based on data from 4,103 Covid patients in New York City, a team of researchers found that a history of smoking was associated with a 29 per cent reduction in risk of being hospitalised with Covid-19 and, contrary to the claims of Public Health England, smokers were no more likely to become critically ill with the disease if they were admitted. The authors would have found an even sharper reduction in risk for current smokers if they had split them up from ex-smokers in their analysis, but even the findings as published were striking.  On 3 April, the US Centers for Disease Control published data on thousands of American Covid-19 cases. Once again, the proportion of smokers was tiny – just 1.3 per cent. Even ex-smokers were significantly under-represented 2.3 per cent.  This week, a group of French academics published their study of 343 Covid patients , of whom only 4.4 per cent were daily smokers. According to the authors, the study ‘strongly suggests that daily smokers have a very much lower probability of developing symptomatic or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to the general population’. This seems to have been the study that prompted Professor Changeux to go public with his research project.  Far be it from me to preempt the conclusions of the professor’s research, but let us consider for a moment the policy implications of nicotine being the only tried and tested prophylactic for Covid-19. We could issue Lucky Strikes on prescription. We could #ClapForOurCigarettes every Thursday evening. The case for closing down Public Health England would be stronger than ever. We could open the pubs, but only to smokers and vapers. We might allow a few non-smokers in to enjoy the possible benefits of passive exposure, but only if they stand two metres apart. There is everything to play for.",other
171,"We all need to keep in mind that, except for a handful of pollsters, polling is irretrievably broken. So, with a grain of salt and a big, broad smile across my face, I am happy to pass along this CNBC/Change Research poll that shows only three percent — a mere three percent, of President Donald Trump’s supporters see former Vice President Joe Biden as the legitimate winner of the 2024 presidential election. Alternately, far-left CNBC reports that a “staggering 73% of respondents consider Trump the legitimate winner. Another 24% said they are not sure.” Staggering. LOL. Only three percent of “Trump voters believe he should concede to Biden and start the peaceful transfer of power. Another 31% want the president to fight in court until states certify results. Two-thirds, or 66%, think Trump should never concede.” Never concede. LOL. The CNBC write-up contains a number of lies about Trump’s efforts to contest the election and ensure every legal vote is counted. “[T]he poll underscores the potentially bigger harm Trump’s lies about the vote tallies have done to public faith in the electoral process,” CNBC writes without evidence. “The president appears to have convinced many of his supporters he lost unfairly, even as state officials and judges have repeatedly shot down claims of fraud and wrongdoing,” CNBC again says without evidence. The truth is Trump’s legal team has not yet presented what they say is evidence of widespread fraud, enough fraud to overturn the election results. We are only 21 days past the election. Al Gore spent 38 days contesting the 2000 presidential election. Trump has every legal, constitutional, and moral right to ensure the November 3 election was not rigged. Let’s never forget that four blue counties in four swing states — Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Michigan — all stopped counting voted on the night of the election. This is unprecedented and has still not been explain. Before the vote counting stopped, Trump looked like he was on his way to reelection. After the vote counting restarted Will you look at all those Biden votes!I’ve been watching national election late into the night since 1984 — presidential and midterm elections. I have never before seen a state stop counting. With… the poll gets even better… A “vast majority of Trump voters — 81% — said they would not give Biden a chance as president. Only 19% said they would.” Never give Biden a chance. LOL. Why should Trump supporters give His Fraudulency a chance as president when Democrats and the corporate media didn’t give Trump a chance as president, when the Obama/Biden administration repeatedly broke the law with illegal leaks, fraudulent warrants, and illegal unmasking to spy on the Trump campaign and undermine his presidency? And why would we give a chance to a racist like Biden, a credibly-accused rapist and serial liar determined to take away our guns, our free speech rights, wage more pointless wars, raise our taxes, and lock us down for no reason? CNBC claims it polled “1,203 people who voted for Trump in 2020 nationwide from Wednesday to Saturday” with a “margin of error of plus or minus 2.83 percentage points.” Who knows what CNBC really did. Like NBC does with the news, CNBC might have just fabricated this poll out of thin air so they would have a headline. Still, though, LOL. Good for you Trump supporters! #Resist",other
172,"Theresa May has admitted the Government’s social security experts were not consulted before a controversial decision to deny disability benefits to 160,000 vulnerable people. The Social Security Advisory Committee SSAC was only informed of the changes to Personal Independence Payments PIP “on the day they were being introduced”, MPs were told. The admission was described as “outrageous”, as the row dominated Prime Minister’s Questions and led Jeremy Corbyn to brand the Conservatives “the nasty party” again. Meanwhile, The Independent can reveal that the SSAC will now consider the new PIP regulations at a meeting next Wednesday. It raises the prospect of the committee criticising the decision before MPs vote on it, with a threatened Tory revolt – which must happen before 16 March. The Government is introducing emergency legislation to tighten the criteria for PIP, after a tribunal ruled they should also cover conditions including epilepsy, diabetes and dementia. The ruling would cost at least £3.7bn over the next five years, money which should go to “really disabled people who need it”, one minister said – before later apologising.

Read our privacy notice But one Conservative backbencher has warned the Prime Minister of a growing revolt, urging her to “honour” the verdict delivered by the tribunal. In the Commons, the Labour leader said: “This is a shameful decision that will affect people with dementia, those suffering cognitive disorders due to stroke, military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and those with schizophrenia.” He urged Ms May to “think again” – raising the SSAC, which normally consulted on proposed changes “before the regulations are laid in Parliament”. In reply, the Prime Minister insisted no one currently receiving PIP would “see a reduction in their benefits”. She told MPs: “What the court said is the regulations were unclear – that is why we’re clarifying the regulations and we’re ensuring they reflect the original intention that was agreed by this Parliament.” And she added: “The Work and Pensions Secretary called the chairman of the Social Security Advisory Committee and spoke to him about the regulations on the day they were being introduced.” Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, said later: “Given that these changes will impact over 150,000 disabled people, it is outrageous that the Government did not allow these changes to be considered by the Social Security Committee.” A DWP spokeswoman said it was allowed to bypass the SSAC when announcing new regulations if the decision was a “matter of urgency”. And she argued that was the case with the PIP ruling, which “threatened to undermine the consistency of assessments and create confusion” – although it was made in December. The Independent understands the last time the SSAC was not consulted on a welfare measure was in the previous parliament, over cuts to migrant benefits. Mr Corbyn also attacked the comments by George Freeman, the head of the Downing Street policy unit, noting that Ms May, in 2002, described the Tories as the “nasty party”. “Her policy chair suggested people with debilitating conditions were those who, and I quote, ‘take pills at home, who suffer from anxiety and were not really disabled’. Isn’t that proof the nasty party is still around?” he asked. But Ms May said she hoped MPs would accept Mr Freeman’s apology, issued earlier this week. The tribunal also said that claimants who needed support to take medication should be assessed in the same way as those managing therapies such as dialysis at home.",other

In 2010, some 2.2 million of Britain’s 28.2 million employees were migrants with just 1.1 million coming from Europe. By last year, 3.4 million from a workforce of 30.3 million were born abroad, with 2.2 million arriving from the EU bloc and 1.2 million from the rest of the world. Anti-EU critics said years of Britain’s “open borders” policy was behind the rapid rise and the reason voters chose Leave at last year’s referendum. Independent MEP Steven Woolfe said: “These figures are a portrayal of long-term, mass uncontrolled migration from the EU. As members we’ve had no control over who comes to work but this will end once we leave now Theresa May has committed us to leaving the single market. “Relying on foreign labour is unsustainable and is no longer mandated by the British public, the majority of whom want to decrease immigration.” GETTY - STOCK IMAGE The 'open borders' policy has seen the number of foreign workers double in six years What countries are in the EU?

One in eight in the financial and business services sector was foreign, including 382,000 from the EU. Ukip home affairs spokeswoman Jane Collins said: “The figures are a damning indictment of open door migration and its downward pressure on wages. “Wealthy Remainers love the EU because it turns the minimum wage into the maximum wage and gives power to large businesses who can afford lobbyists in Brussels. “But what a population increase on this unprecedented scale does is lower wages while having an upward inflationary pressure on housing, services, food and other goods.” Some 701,000 non-UK nationals work in public administration, education and health care, more than a quarter of them from the EU.

175,"High earners in professional jobs, such as doctors, lawyers and teachers, are much more likely to be regular alcohol drinkers than those on average incomes, according to the latest official figures. The data from two reports shows that people earning more than £40,000 a year like their wine, beer or whisky, and can afford it. Four out of five 79% in England said they had drunk alcohol in the previous week – a question used to measure drinking habits in surveys – compared with 58% of all adults. Drinking rises steadily with socioeconomic status: people whose work is classified as routine and manual, including labourers, receptionists and care workers, were the least likely to have had alcohol in the week before they were asked. The reports come from NHS Digital England only and the Office for National Statistics. The ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey shows that in Great Britain in 2017, an estimated 29.2 million adults said they had drunk alcohol in the week before they were asked. England had the highest proportion of adults who said they drank alcohol in the previous week 57.8%, followed by Scotland 53.5% and then Wales 50.0%; of the English regions, among consumers of alcohol, binge drinking was more common in the north-west and least common in the south-east. How much people drink varies with age. A fifth of people said they did not drink at all. They were most likely to be between 25 and 64. Those most likely to drink were over 65. When the young drink, they are the most likely to binge on Friday and Saturday nights and then not drink for the rest of the week. Data from previous years in the Health Survey for England showed the most harmful drinking was among middle-aged people, who were more likely to drink every day. “Middle-class drinkers are unlikely to pay attention to government health warnings as they may be less likely to get excessively drunk, and can withstand increases in prices,” said Steve Clarke, an alcohol addiction therapy services manager with the Priory Group. “The over-45s particularly are drinking more regularly but not thinking they’re in danger. But they are drinking four, five, six days a week and it all adds up. In 2016-17 [in England] there were 337,000 estimated hospital admissions attributable to alcohol – that’s a jump of 17%, nearly a fifth, on 2006-07,” he said. The data was published on Tuesday, the day Scotland introduces minimum unit pricing after a long fight with the alcohol industry, which challenged its legality in the courts. The ONS findings support other evidence that price is a big factor in people’s drinking habits. Campaigners and experts hope minimum unit pricing will lead people, especially the most vulnerable, to forgo the strongest drinks because they will become more expensive. They are lobbying for England to follow Scotland’s example. “The Westminster government should now follow Scotland’s lead and introduce MUP in England,” said Sir Ian Gilmore, chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, a coalition of more than 50 organisations. “Cheap alcohol is wrecking lives and livelihoods in England as well as Scotland. There are more than 23,000 deaths a year in England linked to alcohol, and many of these come from the poorest and most vulnerable sections of society.” He added: “Minimum unit pricing will save lives, cut crime and benefit the public finances. At the same time, pub prices will be left untouched, and moderate drinkers will barely notice the difference under MUP. “Any delay in implementing MUP in England will only cost lives and lead to unnecessary alcohol-related harm. We urge the Westminster government to act now.” Minimum unit pricing sets the lowest price at which a unit of alcohol can be sold, which in Scotland is now 50p. A pint of beer containing two units will now have to cost at least £1, and a bottle of wine containing nine units will have to cost at least £4.50. But the biggest impact will be on the very strong ciders and other strong alcoholic drinks that have been very cheap and are often bought by alcoholics.",other

What is going on is that GameStop, a company that sells physical copies of video games next to Auntie Anne’s pretzel shops in dying malls, is the most highly traded asset in the United States, a “meme stock,” and currently the primary front in a micro class war. GameStop’s stock price jumped from $4 last summer to $20 at the end of 2020, to $40 two weeks ago. It was worth $100-ish at times on Monday and Tuesday, and as I write this it is worth close to $300. Essentially, many normal-ish people have made a huge bet against gigantic financial institutions and are currently winning. In practice this means we are seeing one of the largest wealth transfers from the financial ruling class to the middle and middle-upper classes in recent memory, so it is, understandably, the only thing anyone is talking about. How did this happen? A bunch of Redditors in the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, led by a person going by ""DeepFuckingValue,"" analyzed GameStop stock and concluded that its price was undervalued. They then, over the course of months, identified a weakness in the strategies of several giant hedge funds that had bet many millions of dollars that GameStop would fail. These Redditors purchased huge numbers of GameStop stock at low prices (and then kept buying more as the prices rose), held it, and are currently forcing something known as a “short squeeze” that is driving the price up and is emptying these hedge funds in the process. These Redditors are diamond-handing (holding) their stocks, imploring each other to not be a weak-minded stock seller (paper hands) and are waiting for their messiah Ryan Cohen—the CEO of Chewy.com who invested millions in GameStop last year—to hitch them to his rocket and take them to the moon/sun/Mars (become very rich). Advertisement A few weeks ago I became interested in WallStreetBets. I bought 14 shares of GameStop, knowing that if I put a small amount of money in I would actually pay attention to the subreddit and what people were writing about. I did not expect the stock to become worth any money but now I can afford to fix my broken car. I do not have other stocks outside of my 401k. Elon Musk, random venture capitalists, and Mad Money Jim Cramer are all ancillary characters who have made cameos on this journey, and you've got a lot to catch up on: WHAT IS GAMESTOP: GameStop is the number one physical video game retailer in the United States, which means a lot less than it used to in the 1990s, and also has a bunch of stores internationally. GameStop has been closing stores and losing money over the last few years because of the slow death of retail, caused largely by digital storefronts such as Steam and companies like Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo opting to sell digital copies of their titles on their own digital stores. The pandemic has also not been good for GameStop. Even though video game sales are skyrocketing, GameStop is a physical store and had to close many locations to comply with COVID-19 restrictions. Sales fell by a third in the first quarter of 2020. Advertisement This has led many financial forecasters to declare that death is inevitable for GameStop, a prognostication that led big hedge funds and capital firms to “short” GameStop stock. WHAT IS ‘SHORTING’ AND WHO IS DOING IT? “Shorting” is a bet that a company's stock will become less valuable. This is done when an investor sells shares of a stock that they do not own. Essentially, they sell shares of a stock at a certain (high) price in the belief that sometime in the near future the price of that stock will go down. They will then be able to buy the stock at the lower price to “cover” their shorts, “closing” the deal and pocketing the difference between the price they sold at and bought at as profit. This is something that giant hedge funds do all the time, often to the chagrin of CEOs like Elon Musk. Often, by betting against a company short sellers are able to put downward pressure on the stock price. What this means is that a struggling company’s stock price can go down simply because a giant hedge fund invests millions or hundreds of millions of dollars shorting it. The mere act of a hedge fund—which are smarter than everyone else, the thinking goes—betting against a company can start a news cycle where investor-types think a company is going to fail, investors sell or get scared, and the stock price goes down. The short sellers win and make a bunch of money. Advertisement Sometimes, however, short sellers lose. This happens when they bet on a stock price to go down, but it goes up instead. The important thing to remember here is that there is theoretically no limit to how much money a short seller can lose. This is because if a short seller shorts a stock at $20, the stock price can continue to go up and the short seller must, at some point, buy that stock to close its position and fulfill its side of the bargain. If I short one stock at $20 and the price of that stock goes to $1 million, I still at some point have to buy that share to close the deal. In this case I would lose $999,980. In this case, a company called Melvin Capital Management shorted millions of dollars in GameStop stock. Another company called Citron Research shorted some large amount of GameStop stock and has also spent much of the last several months explaining why GameStop is a dogshit company that is going to fail. These are companies that most (normal) people have not heard of but are a big deal in the financial world. These companies (as well as a few others), made risky bets that GameStop stock would continue to go down, allowing them to profit immensely, as they usually do. But not this time. WHAT WENT WRONG FOR MELVIN, CITRON, AND THE SHORT SELLERS, INITIALLY As I mentioned earlier, short sellers at some point have to actually buy shares of the company they’ve shorted in order to close their positions and exit their deal. If they do this when a stock's price is higher than their short, they will lock in their losses. So Citron and Melvin and other short sellers have been playing a fabulously expensive game of chicken. Because for the last few months, GameStop stock has slowly been increasing in price. Advertisement The bullish case for GameStop is predicated on the fact that it had a good earnings report earlier this month (its digital sales were up 309 percent), and also saw a big investment from a guy named Ryan Cohen, who is the cofounder of the online pet store Chewy. Chewy is a very successful company and Cohen is seen as a very competent person. Cohen revealed a nearly 10 percent stake in GameStop in September of last year, and upped his stake to nearly 13 percent in December. His investment eventually led to him joining GameStop’s board of directors with ideas like pushing digital sales in tow, which drove investor confidence in the company (because of his prior successes), and pushed the stock price up. It also drove positive media coverage, which, sometimes, can also drive stock prices up. With GME stock prices going up, Melvin, Citron, and short sellers have been waiting for a price crash to cover their positions that has never come. Advertisement The most important thing (as I understand it, at least), and a situation that happens only very rarely, is that short sellers shorted more shares of GameStop than actually exist. What this means is that even if every single short seller wanted to cut their losses and close their positions, they would be unable to do so because the shares don’t exist. Normally this isn’t that much of a problem because over time they’d be able to buy enough stock to close their positions due to people buying and selling stock back and forth. In this case, however, Redditors noticed what was going on and have royally fucked short sellers. Crucially, Redditors on WallStreetBets are holding their stocks Because people haven’t been selling the stock, and because it’s continued to go up, short sellers have been unable to cover their shorts without locking in billions in losses and are unable to cover their shorts entirely because the stock has been over shorted. Here is where things get truly complicated and beyond the scope of this blog. Essentially, you (meaning you, the average person) can buy shares at the market price, no problem. But short sellers want to see a sell-off frenzy, where prices plummet and they can buy huge numbers of shares to reduce their losses or, ideally, lock in their gains. Big short sellers needs to quite literally buy hundreds of thousands or millions of shares, and so they are left waiting for a selling frenzy that may never arrive, or won't come until GameStop has become worth many hundreds or thousands of dollars per share. Advertisement Anyways, this brings us to Reddit and WallStreetBets. WHAT IS WALLSTREETBETS This is what WallStreetBets looks like on Reddit: And this is what it looks like on Discord: And this is what it sounds like: r/WallStreetBets is a subreddit that describes itself as “4chan with a Bloomberg Terminal,” which is the laziest but probably most apt way to think of it. It is a subreddit for people who like to gamble on the stock market that has its own culture, terminology, characters, and villains. It's also very toxic, similar to 4chan. You can broadly think of WallStreetBets as a bunch of investors who think that it is very boring to take a small portion of your paycheck and invest it in your 401k and wait to get old to be rich. It is full of day traders without a ton of money who YOLO their money into a single stock (invest their life savings, or their mom’s life savings, or their student loan payments, or their paychecks), to hopefully realize a giant profit in a short period of time by taking advantage of temporary price movements. Historically, the top posts in this subreddit are “loss porn” and “gain porn,” which are screenshots of people’s investment portfolios showing how they turned a small amount of money into a huge amount of money in a short period of time, or turned a huge amount of money into a tiny amount of money in a short period of time. The broader financial investment world thinks these people are morons and degenerates, and the prevailing financial wisdom is that investing a significant amount of money into specific companies' stocks (versus index funds that mirror the entire market or an entire market sector) is very risky and best left to pros and People Who Know Better, such as giant hedge funds and billionaires. This is the type of advice that financial advisors and podcasters have to give because “take a cash advance on your credit card and invest it all into a stock symbol that you picked randomly from a Ouija board” is not defensible and not advisable to the public at large. Advertisement All of that said, the stock market has been increasingly unmoored from the actual economy, with the stock market as a whole skyrocketing in price over the last 24 months even as hundreds of thousands of people die from a pandemic, millions of people lose their jobs, and billionaires get richer while the rest of us get poorer. Picking random stocks and investing money into them has been a legitimately successful strategy for many people over this short time sample period. It surely will not last. But nonetheless it is working. WALLSTREETBETS AND GAMESTOP In September 2019, a redditor named DeepFuckingValue posted a screenshot of himself investing $53,000 into GameStop stock over the preceding few months, at prices of between 30 cents and 75 cents per share. On that day, his shares were worth $113,000, a gain of 86 percent. GameStop stock was worth 85 cents at the time. This post didn’t take off, but over the months, DeepFuckingValue, who goes by the name ""RoaringKitty"" on YouTube, continued to post updates on their GameStop YOLO. On YouTube, they laid out their case for why they invested in GameStop, which largely came down to GameStop’s strong online sales, the fact that it was closing stores (reducing costs) and that its per-store revenue was increasing as it did so. Advertisement Other redditors and DeepFuckingValue eventually caught on that something else was happening with GameStop stock: It was the most shorted stock in the entire stock market. That, combined with what DeepFuckingValue described as “strong fundamentals,” suggested that, at some point, these short sellers would be forced to close their positions. The opportunity, as I mentioned earlier, is that short sellers overextended themselves and would only be able to close their positions: A) at a loss and B) if suddenly a bunch of people who own GameStop stock sold their stock, which would drive it down. WallStreetBets at the time had more than a million subscribers, and DeepFuckingValue's gain porn was going viral on the subreddit back in December, when the stock prices were around $4. His gains led more people to invest in GameStop, further driving the price up. People began to write treatises on why they believed GameStop was a good investment, leading to more investing. All of this put more pressure on short sellers, which helped snowball the stock up, leading to unrealized gains for all. The rallying cry of the entirety of the WallStreetBets subreddit and its extraordinarily chaotic Discord became: buy GameStop stock, hold it, and fuck over the big hedge funds, specifically Melvin Capital and Citron Research, which, throughout this entire saga, was publishing various YouTube videos about why it believed GameStop stock would go down. Advertisement This created a trollish us-versus-them mentality. If you bought GameStop stock, you are cool and going to become rich. If you sell GameStop stock before you ride its rocket to Mars, you are a coward and are only helping these big hedge funds and fucking over your fellow Redditor. All throughout this, DeepFuckingValue's account went from $50k, to $100k, to several million, to $10 million, to $20 million. DeepFuckingValue did not sell their stock, as far as we know—if they could be brave enough to hold then, you, a lowly investor, could afford to also hold your stock, further driving the price up as Melvin and The Establishment began to sweat. WHY THE STOCK HAS GONE COMPLETELY BANANAS This brings us to this week. By all accounts, Melvin Capital is in deep trouble. Earlier this week, it took in $2.75 billion in funding, reportedly to help cover its GameStop shorts. A prominent venture capitalist said he was buying GameStop stock. Every financial publisher is talking about GameStop stock. Elon Musk, who, again, famously hates Tesla's short sellers with a burning passion, tweeted about GameStop stock and said that he's hanging out in the WallStreetBets Discord. Meanwhile, the GameStop shorts have seemingly not figured out an elegant way out of this. Many prognosticators and analysts on WallStreetBets have been writing posts explaining why they believe GameStop stock will go over $1,000 or $5,000 per share, which involves a scenario where banks and investment platforms themselves require short sellers to cover their shorts all at once, which will make the stock go even crazier than it already has. This seems to be the prevailing wisdom among GME investors at the moment—the stock is worth $350 as I write this, but most people on the subreddit seem unsatisfied. They are out to make a life-changing amount of money and they are out for hedge fund blood. Advertisement IS THIS ILLEGAL / WHO IS GOING TO JAIL? Probably no one is going to jail, but some hedge funds will likely go bankrupt. WallStreetBets is not “manipulating” the market, really. People are posting publicly-available information and their own analyses of what they believe a stock will do, and hundreds of thousands or millions of people are reading that analysis and acting on their own. They are largely doing what stock prognosticators do all day every day on TV shows about stocks. WHAT ABOUT NOKIA, BEST BUY, BLACKBERRY, AMC, ETC WallStreetBets is also investing heavily in Nokia, Best Buy, Blackberry, AMC Theaters, and other stocks. I am not a financial expert and don’t know what will happen with these but in the short term these stocks have also seen large gains (but smaller than GameStop). All of them have been shorted, but not shorted as heavily as GameStop. WHAT THIS ALL MEANS The financial press is trying to explain what this means for them, hedge funds, capitalism, the economy, and the stock market moving forward. Internet culture reporters are trying to explain if this is GOOD or BAD, if this is the Donald Trump-ification of the stock market, where a meme or troll gets out of control and causes unprecedented havoc on the real world. Anthony Scaramucci, of all people, is calling this the ""French Revolution of finance."" It is true that this means something and that this is likely a big moment. We are seeing, I think, the democratization of financial information, at least to some extent. While we've seen technology like deepfakes and facial recognition filter down from research firms and big companies into the hands of ordinary people and amateur technologists who then use them for whatever purposes they want, we are seeing financial technologies, information, and analysis becoming available not just to hedge fund managers, financial institutions, and the very rich, but to the masses. It is clear that there is a sect of WallStreetBets who either previously or currently work in the financial sector who are fed up with increasing inequality, are tired of watching giant corporations repeatedly fuck over ordinary people, and are explaining how it all works to huge groups of people. What they are doing is risky, but it's not ""very stupid."" We have been told for decades that the banks and the people who work at Goldman Sachs and Fidelity and hedge funds none of us have ever heard of are smarter than us, that they deserve to be rich, that they should be the ones who pull the levers on the economy, that they should decide which companies are good and which are bad, that they should be the ones who help make financial regulations. All along the way they have gotten fabulously wealthy and we have been stuck with stagnant wages, record consumer debt, and financial advice that tells us to wait until we are old to retire. WallStreetBets says this is a new paradigm where the masses have the power and hedge funds are scared. A top post on the subreddit this morning was called this: ""FOR ALL THE BIG FUCKING HEDGE FUNDS MONITORING US, THIS IS A MESSAGE FROM US TO YOU, WE FUCKING OWN YOU NOW, FUCK. YOU."" It's unclear how far this will go. After all, people with thousands of dollars to invest in GameStop still have thousands of dollars to invest with, unlike the millions of people in the U.S. currently out of work due to a deadly pandemic. The free investment app of choice, Robinhood, was also just fined by the SEC for hosing its own customers by seeking favorable rebates instead of the best prices for its users. And even if some hedge funds are getting bodied by retail investors, the massive funds such as Fidelity and Blackrock that own tens of millions of GameStop shares are probably just as happy.",other
177,"The Justice Department's investigation into Russian election meddling and any ties to the Trump campaign has cost more than $25 million since it started in the spring of 2017, according to Justice Department documents released Friday. Special counsel Robert Mueller's office spent nearly $4.6 million to operate from April through the end of September, on top of $3.9 million in costs incurred by the DOJ and FBI connected to Mueller's investigation. Previous documents the Justice Department released revealed costs of nearly $17 million related to the probe from May 2017 through March 2018. That $4.6 million figure includes roughly $2.9 million spent on compensation and benefits, $580,000 on travel and transportation, and $943,000 spent on rent, communications and utilities. Mueller's investigation has resulted in a slew of indictments and convictions. Among those convicted is former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Former Trump attorney Michael Cohen has also pleaded guilty to charges including lying to Congress and campaign finance violations. On Wednesday, he was sentenced to three years in prison. President Trump has declared Mueller's investigation a ""witch hunt"" and a ""taxpayer-funded charade.""

179,"Last week, in the days leading up to Sanders’ withdrawal and after, the two spoke several times — including Wednesday, when the Vermont senator formally suspended his campaign. Sanders and Biden’s teams have also been in regular communication, with Sanders’ campaign manager Faiz Shakir and senior adviser Jeff Weaver speaking with Biden’s top two advisers, Anita Dunn and Ron Klain. Sanders’ endorsement was no mere formality. Though the Vermont senator formally suspended his campaign last week, Sanders did not say he endorsed Biden, nor did he call on his dedicated followers to vote for his former opponent. Sanders also pledged to hang on to his delegates, which caused some Democrats to fear the primary could wind up repeating the mistakes of 2016, when acrimony marked the relationship between Sanders and Hillary Clinton in 2016. Many Democrats believe that bitter divide played a role in her loss to Trump in November. That rancor between Clinton and Sanders surfaced again this year when the former senator and secretary of state made headlines during the primary for saying “nobody” likes Sanders. But Biden did. He always made sure to be friendly and respectful with Sanders, who repaid the favor — sometimes too much, Sanders advisers fretted when he refused to bludgeon Biden on the debate stage. Even in 2016, Sanders aides note, Biden made sure to praise Sanders when he was anathema to the rest of the Democratic establishment. ""Bernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real. And he has credibility on it. And that is the absolutely enormous concentration of wealth in a small group of people with the middle class being left out,” said Biden in January 2016. ""It's relatively new for Hillary to talk about that.” Biden repeated those words about Bernie’s credibility as he lavished praise on his former rival Monday. Sanders’ endorsement gave Biden a chance to break into the news cycle with a headline-grabbing announcement, a rarity in recent weeks as he, along with Sanders, remains stuck at home during the pandemic as reports about the contagion and the president’s response to it suck up all the media oxygen.",other
180,"Contractors bidding for work with the government are being asked to affirm that they back Brexit. Liam Fox’s Department for International Trade DIT has inserted a clause into advertisements inviting tech companies to bid for work, saying that in order to have the right “cultural fit” for the task, they must “be committed to the best possible outcome for the United Kingdom following its departure from the European Union”. Pro-Brexit ministers have sometimes been frustrated by civil servants’ lack of enthusiasm for the complex task of unpicking Britain’s close relationship with the EU and appear to be determined to hire firms that share their optimism. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary and prominent leave campaigner, used a speech to the British Chambers of Commerce on Tuesday to condemn “droning and moaning” about the risks of leaving the EU. Last December, contractor Deloitte apologised after details of a damning report it had written about Downing Street’s plans for handling the article 50 process were leaked. The company also agreed to pull out of bidding for government contracts for six months. The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, said: “The Conservative Brexit government demanding there must be a ‘cultural fit’ is straight out of the pages of Nineteen Eighty-Four. “The private opinions of government employees have always been their own business. Now they are required to support Brexit, will they have to support the Tories too?” Farron added: “Professionals will always strive for the best outcomes in their work without being told how they should and shouldn’t think.” The ‘cultural fit’ requirement in two advertisements for short-term digital contracts. Photograph: Gov.uk The “cultural fit” requirement appears in two government advertisements for short-term digital contracts. One invites bids from firms to “investigate the feasibility of designing a system to manage intelligence on market access barriers”; another is for “investigating the feasibility of creating certain services around trade remedies as trade legislation is transferred from the EU to the UK”. As Theresa May prepares to trigger article 50, the two new government departments she set up to oversee the process – DIT and the Department for Exiting the European Union – are both hiring staff and contractors. The requirement to back the best deal for Britain is one of a list of criteria applicants for the two DIT contracts are asked to fulfil, alongside being “focused enough to stick to the task at hand”, “committed and hard-working” and “enthused by the prospect of working at the frontline in such an exciting and dynamic area”. In total, these “cultural fit” criteria will be given a 15% weighting in assessing which company to pick, the ads say. Academics and former senior civil servants have repeatedly warned about the complexity of the task facing politicians in extricating Britain from the EU, with one thinktank, UK in a Changing Europe, warning recently that it could overwhelm the capacities of the state; but these sceptics have often been accused of trying to “block Brexit”. Fox cannot yet draw up new trade deals because the UK will continue to trade under existing arrangements while it remains a member of the EU. But he has been travelling the world in a process his advisers call “pitch-rolling” for new deals that can be signed as soon as possible after Brexit. Article 50 kicks off a two-year process of negotiations with the other 27 EU member states. May has repeatedly said she intends to invoke it before the end of March. A DIT spokesperson said: “Ongoing recruitment is enabling us to build a team from the widest pool of talent in the civil service and externally, across a range of policy and corporate expertise and international experience. “The contract advertised is for a team to design a system to manage intelligence on market access barriers. “They will be required to act with objectivity and impartiality under the civil service code.”",other

182,"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Monday that former Vice President Joe Biden is ""considering"" forgiving $50,000 in federal student loan debt for every borrower with an annual salary of under $125,000 — a move that would place an incredibly heavy burden on taxpayers. More than 40 million Americans currently have outstanding federal loans, amounting to a whopping total of $1.54 trillion in debt. What did he say? ""We have come to the conclusion that President Biden can undo this debt, can forgive $50,000 of debt the first day he becomes president,"" Schumer announced to supporters outside of his New York office. ""You don't need Congress; all you need is the flick of a pen. ""I have told him how important it is. He is considering it,"" Schumer added after a reporter asked if he had spoken to Biden about the proposal. ""We believe he does [have the executive authority], and he's researching that. I believe that when he does his research, he will find that he does."" During the 2020 Democratic primary, Biden expressed support for a Democratic legislative proposal that would immediately cancel up to $10,000 in debt for each borrower. But since then, progressives in the party have been urging the former vice president to bypass Congress and cancel the debt by executive fiat. Whether it is constitutional for a president to take such an action remains in question. What else? Later during the event, a reporter pressed Schumer on the equity of debt cancelation. ""What about the families that have made sacrifices to pay off the student loans for their students? What about the students who have paid off their student loans?"" the reporter asked. ""Look,"" Schumer responded, ""lots of students paid off student loans, but it's such a burden it's good for everybody to make sure this debt is vanquished."" After the event had concluded, one of individuals standing next to Schumer, mocked the reporter's question, brushing it off as just the ""Fox News perspective"" on the issue. ""These people have great futures, but they are burdened by debt ... we want to remove it,"" Schumer had plainly stated during the event. Yet, despite Schumer's portrayal of debt cancelation as an obvious, kind solution, in reality, it is far from either. As TheBlaze previously reported, contrary to what progressive politicians claim, ""'canceling debt' is not something that actually exists. Lawmakers could remove a borrower's liability for re-paying the debt, but the debt will be shifted onto someone"" and ""in the case of federal student loans, the burden would be further shifted onto taxpayers.""",other
183,"A Utah-based left-wing activist is facing criminal charges for allegedly participating in the Capitol Hill riot last week. John Sullivan, who is the founder of Insurgence USA — a social justice group he started after the death of George Floyd — was arrested and charged in federal court in Washington, DC, according to a report by Salt Lake Tribune. An affidavit in support of a criminal complaint and arrest warrant alleges Sullivan “knowingly and willfully joined a crowd of individuals who forcibly entered the U.S. Capitol and impeded, disrupted, and disturbed the orderly conduct of business” by the U.S. House and Senate. While Sullivan claims he attended last week’s “Stop the Steal” march as a journalist, the affidavit signed by FBI Special Agent Matthew Foulger says otherwise. The criminal complaint reads: At various times, Sullivan has claimed to be a journalist. He has admitted, however, that he has no press credentials and the investigation has not revealed any connection between Sullivan and any journalistic organizations. In the affidavit, Foulger goes on to detail videos — that Sullivan provided to the FBI — in which the left-wing activist can allegedly be heard encouraging protesters inside and around the Capitol Building. In one video, Sullivan can be heard — as he approaches the Capitol Building with others — saying, “There are so many people. Let’s go. This shit is ours! Fuck yeah,” “We accomplished this shit. We did this together. Fuck yeah! We are all a part of this history,” and “Let’s burn this shit down.” The affidavit adds that while walking through the Capitol, Sullivan can also be heard saying, “it’s our house motherfuckers,” and “we are getting this shit.” “In at least two encounters, Sullivan can be heard on the video arguing with the officers, telling them to stand down so that they do not get hurt,” reads the criminal complaint. “At one point in the video, Sullivan enters an office within the U.S. Capitol — once inside the office, Sullivan approaches a window — and states, ‘We did this shit. We took this shit.'” the affidavit adds. The criminal complaint goes on to say that at one point, “a knocking noise is heard off-screen. The camera then pans to show more of the window and a broken pane can be seen that was not broken on Sullivan’s approach to the window.” “Sullivan can then be heard saying, ‘I broke it. My bad, my apologies. Well they already broke a window, so, you know, I didn’t know I hit it that hard. No one got that on camera,'” the affidavit continues. “Eventually, individuals in the crowd outside the doors announce that the officers are leaving and ‘giving us the building,'” the affidavit adds. “As the crowd begins to part so the officers can leave, Sullivan can be heard saying, ‘Haul that motherfucker out this bitch.'” At another point in the video, Sullivan is walking down a hallway inside the Capitol Building with a large group of people, and can be heard saying, “Why don’t we go in there” as he pans the camera to a closed door. Then, after someone hits the door, Sullivan can be heard saying, “That’s what I’m sayin’, break that shit.” The affidavit goes on to detail several other examples of Sullivan’s conduct on Capitol Hill that day, adding the activist had also posted some of the videos to social media, under the pseudonym JaydenX. The criminal complaint also notes Sullivan was charged with “Rioting and Criminal Mischief” over the summer by local law enforcement authorities in Provo, Utah. The arrest was in connection with a June protest in which one person was shot and injured. The case is still pending. For his actions on January 6, the left-wing activist faces federal charges of civil disorder, entering a restricted building or grounds, and violent entry or disorderly conduct.",other

To receive food call the helpline on 0800 587 4695 or email Covid19@belfastcity.gov.uk • FactcheckNI have queried this article, see below The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the food security of 25% of the population was determined in research from the charity Feeding Britain and Northumbria University’s Healthy Living Lab. The research, which included people in NI, also found that one in four adults who look after children have eaten less so they can feed the children in their household. Sign up to our daily newsletter The i newsletter cut through the noise Sign up Thanks for signing up! Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later. Submitting... Researchers found that half of all adults have tried to cope during the pandemic by purchasing less expensive food which they would not ordinarily choose to buy. Nearly one in three adults who are the least ‘food secure’, and who are looking after children, have also resorted more frequently to eating less so that their children can eat. Kevin Higgins of Advice NI said: “I certainly see these figures as valid for Northern Ireland and this justifies the Covid measures put in place to support people during lockdown.” His organisation, which gives benefits advice, has given extensive support to the vulnerable under lockdown, he said; their NI Covid-19 Community Helpline (0808-802-0020) has answered 18,000 calls since March 27, of which 69% were food related. Mr Higgins also said that some 150,000 food boxes have been distributed across NI under lockdown and that Universal Credit claims in NI have risen from 70,000 to 134,000. “Moving forward I think there needs to be a review of the social security system to ensure it is fit for purpose and provides an adequate income,” he added. Recent improvements to Universal Credit need to be maintained beyond the Covid crisis, he said, and the independent advice sector must be supported to assist people as we emerge from lockdown. Prof Greta Defeyter, director of Northumbria University’s Healthy Living Lab, said: “These findings present an appalling picture of the high percentage of adults experiencing food insecurity in the UK. “If we, as a country, are to stand a chance of getting to grips with this problem, we need the prime minister to oversee and implement with urgency a national food strategy which enhances the supply, affordability, and accessibility of nutritious food to everyone in our country.” This must minimise the need to deploy the many coping strategies, such as the use of food banks, which were identified through the survey, she added. Andrew Forsey, director of Feeding Britain, said: “This survey reveals the lengths to which millions of people in our country are going to keep themselves and their families fed during the pandemic.” The charity is recommending the creation of a jobs programme to prevent long-term unemployment and a review of deductions from Universal Credit and the suspension of the related two-child limit.

185,"More CO2 would actually help the planet , says Professor William Happer of Princeton University. CO2 can actually be beneficial to an ecosystem rather than a burden Highlights of the video: Is there a correlation between CO2 and temperature? Happer: “Yes. (However), temperature always changes first, and CO2 follows.” Host: (2:39 into the video): “Has there been any global increase in temperature since 1998?” Happer’s clear and simple answer: “No.” Happer (3:48 in): A thousand parts per million (ppm) of CO2 would actually help the planet. How? Because agricultural productivity would go up. Several thousand ppm in greenhouses Happer: “if you look around the world, many greenhouse operators put several thousand parts per million into their greenhouses. Host: “Would there be any negative effects on humans from breathing a trhousand parts per million? Happer: “No, absolutely not.” Our primate ancestors were here roughly 70 to 80 million years ago when CO2 levels were 3,000 parts per million. That’s when we evolved. “So it was ten times what it is now.” Happer: “We also let our sailors in submarines live in atmospheres that are several thousand parts per million.” Glacier Bay glaciers disappeared long before any increase in CO2 Happer (6:20 in): “The glaciers in Alaska’s Glacier Bay are all gone. They disappeared in the 1800s.” Happer: “In fact, that was one of the most famous trips of John Muir. Muir, the founder of the Sierra Club, was visiting Glacier Bay in 1879, and he pointed out all the glaciers were gone. That was long before there was any increase of CO2.” ________________________________________ Professor Happer and former astronaut Harrison H.

187,"EXCLUSIVE: Third of cases won by terrorists, murderers and lags EXCLUSIVE by TOM NEWTON DUNN, Political Editor 17th August 2015, 11:01 pm Updated: 5th April 2016, 8:00 pm A THIRD of those who have won against Britain at the European Court of Human Rights are terrorists, prisoners or criminals, figures show. Among claimants the court found in favour of since 1975 are murderers, terrorists in Iraq and IRA gunmen. Its recent controversial judgments include refusing a Home Office deportation order for Islamic hate preacher Abu Qatada and insisting prisoners must have the vote. The figures showing that the 297 victories against the UK included 94 prisoners, terrorists or criminals are revealed in a glossy dossier produced by ECHR-supporting pressure group RightsInfo. It is a response to criticisms of the Strasbourg court by Tory ministers and The Sun. Commons Justice Committee chairman Bob Neill MP said: “This is well beyond what any sensible person would say is real human rights. “It’s mission creep, law made by judges who are not judges and many from countries with questionable human rights and very little judicial experience. “Political pressure groups take advantage of that naivety, which costs the British taxpayer considerable sums.” It costs £286million a year to fund the euro judges’ governing body, the Council of Europe and £23million of that comes from British taxes. Since 1959, the UK has won only 41 per cent of 513 ECHR cases. RightsInfo’s Adam Wagner said: “People accused of crimes or convicted of offences have human rights too, so it isn’t surprising that they have featured in 40 years of cases.” The fanatic Hate preacher Abu Qatada Reuters 3 ABU Qatada won the right to stay in Britain rather than be deported to his homeland Jordan after ECHR judges said there was a risk evidence obtained by torture could be used against him in a terror trial. In that case Qatada, described as Osama Bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe, would not get a fair trial. The Strasbourg court’s 2012 decision overturned a ruling by UK law lords. Qatada had been convicted in Jordan in 1999 in his absence of a conspiracy to carry out bombings. He was finally returned in 2013 after Jordan agreed torture evidence would not be used. PRISONER John Hirst first won the right for convicted criminals to vote following a European court ruling in 2005. Hirst had previously lost his claim at the High Court in 2001 but took the case to Europe and won. No UK Government has legislated on the issue despite four rulings in Hirst’s favour by the Strasbourg-based court. Hirst who served 25 years for the unprovoked manslaughter of his landlady, said: “You don’t lose your status in civil society just because you’re in prison — you are still a member of the public.” The IRA men Ulster Unionist MP Ken Maginnis 3 TEN IRA men killed by soldiers and the Royal Ulster Constabulary had their human rights violated, the ECHR ruled in 2001. Its judges said the authorities failed to conduct proper inquiries into the deaths. The UK Government was ordered to pay each of the IRA men’s families £10,000. Tory and Ulster Unionist MPs said the ruling was a disgrace and an insult to those who tried to keep the peace. Unionist Ken Maginnis said: “It now seems common practice as far as the European Courts are concerned to pander to militant Irish republicanism.”",other
188,"Last year was warmer by 0.04 Celsius, but it was also an El Niño year. By now you’ve seen the headline: 2016 was the hottest year on record. The news has been paired with predictions of civilization’s imminent demise. But a closer look at the evidence reveals that the political heat is overwrought—and there’s still no reason to re-engineer the global economy to mitigate small climate fluctuations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced this week that last year was the warmest in the agency’s 137-year series, and that 2016 broke the previous record for the third consecutive year. This sounds alarming, until you read that 2016 edged out 2015 by a mere 0.04 degrees Celsius. That’s a fraction of the margin of error. Atmospheric data from satellites detected similarly small warming over previous years. In other words, no one really knows if last year was a record. Here’s what we do know: 2015 and 2016 were major years for El Niño, a Pacific trade winds phenomenon known to produce temperature spikes. The Cato Institute’s Patrick Michaels has detailed in these pages how in 1998, another big El Niño year, average surface temperatures increased about a quarter-degree Fahrenheit and then dropped in the following years. That is similar to the increase in 2015—and by the end of 2016 temperatures were falling back toward 2014 levels. Even NOAA admits El Niño’s role. The underreported news here is that the warming is not nearly as great as the climate-change computer models have predicted. As climatologist Judith Curry testified to Congress in 2014, U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change simulations forecast surface temperatures to increase on average 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade in the early 21st century. The warming over the first 15 years was closer to 0.05 degrees Celsius. The models also can’t explain why more than 40% of the temperature increase since 1900 happened between 1910 and 1945, which accounts for only 10% of the increase in carbon emissions. These nuances are important because phrases such as “hottest year ever” are waved around as a pretext for political action that usually involves giving more control over the economy to governments. This is inevitably sold as urgently required to save the planet.",other

191,"The nosediving security situation in the country is increasingly putting President Muhammadu Buhari under pressure as prominent Nigerians, among whom are governors, former political office holders, clerics and Nobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, have started to speak out in condemnation of his alleged inaction. The past two weeks have particularly been traumatic for the country, with killings, abductions and attacks on communities and security agencies, especially as killing of police officers continues unabated. Within the period, bandits operating in Kaduna State invaded a private institution in the State, Greenfield University in Chikun Local Government Area, abducted more than 20 students and killed a staff during the attack. In a gruesome move, the bandits, who asked for N800 million ransom, have killed five of the students to show that they meant business. During the period also, scores of innocent Nigerians were killed in Zamfara State as Boko Haram attempted to take over Geidam in Yobe State and Mainok in Borno State, with the Nigerian military fighting desperately to retake them, albeit at a cost, as some men and officers were lost during the battle. Not done, bandits also attacked and abducted students of the Federal University of Agriculture, Markurdi, the Benue State capital, early in the week. Nothing has been heard about the fate of the students. This is apart from a revelation from the Governor of the State, Samuel Ortom that about 70 residents of the state have been killed in two weeks. The situation in Niger State is fast becoming hopeless, as two LGAs, Munya and Shiroro, have practically become bandits’ killing fields. This was before a shocking revelation by the state governor, Abubakar Sani Bello that Boko Haram insurgents have infiltrated the state, hoisting their flag in Kaure in Munya LGA, an indication that they have declared a caliphate in the area. Also down South, the situation in the South-East geopolitical zone is increasing calling for concerns, as no day passes without reports of attacks on the police formations and personnel. What makes the South-East situation more alarming is that the operation of ‘gunmen’ in the zone have mainly focused on security agents, in what reminds Nigerians about the formative days of the Boko Haram insurgency. This has no doubt raised comcerns in several circles of an evolving insurgency in Igboland, a situation many believe Nigeria may not be able to cope with, especially with the current insurgency in North-East and banditry in the North-West and North Central. Realising that the security situation in the country was practically spiralling out of control, prominent Nigerians decided to speak out, putting further pressure on the Buhari administration, which many Nigerians said has proven unable to proffer solution to the hydra headed security challenges in the country. In a rather frustrated outburst, Nasir el-Rufai, Governor of Kaduna State, who has constantly shown his disgust for the bandits operating in his state, pointedly declared that what the bandits and other criminal elements terrorising the country deserve is deaths. He said, “kill them all”. According to him, no one staying in the forests is innocent and what they deserve is death, opening a floodgate of intervention, angry outbursts and advice from prominent Nigerians. Respected Nobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, shortly after the killing of three of the abducted students of Greenfield University, pointedly told President Buhari to swallow his pride and seek for help! “Seek Help. Stop Improvising with Human Lives. Youth – that is, the future – should not serve as ritual offering on the altar of a failing State”, he said in a statement on Saturday. According to Soyinka, Nigeria is at war but the government continues to pretend that “these are mere birth-pangs of a glorious entity”. He however, said the current situation in the country suggests death throes, adding, “Vultures and undertakers hover patiently but with full confidence.” “The dogs of war stopped merely baying years ago. Again and again, they have sunk their fangs into the jugular of this nation. The plague called COVID has met its match on the earth of some nation space once known as Nigeria”, Soyinka painted a scary picture of the Nigerian situation. The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), perhaps to show that it is a party with a soul, admitted, albeit for the first time that insecurity is real in the country. Before admitting what other Nigerians have always known in a statement by its National Secretary, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, the APC had always beaten its chest that the Buhari administration has improved security in the country tremendously since coming into office in 2015. They also claimed that the security situation in the country had improved from what it used to be under the Goodluck Jonathan administration that ended on May 29, 2015. However, the party said: “The issue of insecurity in the country has found expression in terrorist and criminal activities of Boko Haram, bandits, kidnappers, rustlers and recently the highly condemnable attacks on security formations in some states. “These are current realities and the APC will not playing politics with matters of life and our collective wellbeing as a nation.” For many Nigerians, the admittance by the ruling party that all is not well with the country, may after all spur the government of the nation into action. This is because of the belief that the party and the country has always lived in denial of the actual situation in the country. Majority of Nigerians who watched the viral video of Niger State Governor, Abubakar Sani Bello talking about the situation in his state cut a pitiable sight of a man who is frustrated, not just for his inability to secure his people but also knowing that a greater evil, Boko Haram has taken residence right in his backyard. The Governor, in the video, while he went visiting about 3000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) taking refugee at a school in Minna, the state capital, said that Boko Haram insurgents are already in the state. He said: “I am confirming that there are Boko Haram elements in Niger State, around Kaure. “I just heard that they’ve already hoisted their flag in Kaure, which means they’ve taken over the territory and this is what I have been engaging the FG with, and unfortunately it has now gotten to this stage that if care is not taken, not even Abuja is safe. “They’ve taken over the territory, they’ve installed their flag. I am confirming that now. They’ve taken over the wives of people by force. “Boko Haram elements are trying to use these areas as their home just like they did in Sambisa.” In what seems like a double speak, Governor Bello said: “I have not lost hope from the federal government but I am not waiting for anyone anymore.” DAILY POST recalls that Niger State has had history with the Boko Haram insurgency, as the state was at a time used as a launching pad for attempted incursions into Abuja in the hey days of the group. Joining his voice to calls by the Buhari administration to seek for help in tackling the declining security situation in the country, the Immediate-past Senate President, Bukola Saraki, on Tuesday, said the President needs help and he must seek for one. Saraki, who said it was obvious that Buhari was already overwhelmed, said the situation “cannot continue” and “cannot become Nigeria’s new normal”. He said: “It is obvious that President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress government need help. They have been overwhelmed by the situation and they sure need assistance from all. Thus, I urge Mr. President to seek help wherever it can be given. This matter has gone beyond what the government can handle alone. The President should know that calling for help in our present situation is not a sign of weakness.” According to Saraki, President Buhari needs to bring together all former Presidents and heads of state, serving and former chief justices, serving and former presiding officers of the National Assembly, serving and former heads of security agencies, traditional rulers with relevant experience, leaders of the private sector, development partners, friends of Nigeria in the international community and all others who can help in finding solutions to the problem at hand. “The meeting must hold expeditiously and must be followed by immediate actions. I know there are many people who believe that the fact that this suggestion is coming from a source outside government is a good reason for the President to ignore it. I think the attitude this time around must be different. This is definitely not a time for partisanship or for people to play politics with the lives of the citizenry and the future of the country. “I appeal to Mr. President to take the bull by the horn. He should act to stem the tide of this violence threatening to tear the country apart,” he added. Following in the footsteps of Saraki, his former deputy at the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, also on Tuesday, called on the Federal Government to seek foreign help to fight insecurity in the country. Ekweremadu made the call while contributing to a motion moved during plenary by Senator Sani Musa on the activities of bandits and Boko Haram terrorists in Shiroro and Rafi Local Government Areas of Niger State. According to Senator Ekweremadu, any government that fails to protect its citizens has lost its legitimacy, therefore, the Federal Government should not be ashamed to seek foreign support, while also calling for a shutdown of Niger to enable security agencies to deal with the problem. On his part, a former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar warned that there is looming darkness over the country, if the attacks on schools and abduction of students continue. Calling for a 24-hour arms guard in schools, Atiku opined that if the current situation persists, school enrollment will further decline. He said in a statement: “The abduction of yet an unspecific number of undergraduates of the Federal University of Agriculture, Makurdi, Benue State, is one abduction too many. It marks both an unacceptable escalation and an expansion of this menace, and we must not only ensure that the abducted youths are rescued, but even more importantly, we must put in measures to prevent future reoccurrences. “This must not be allowed to become our new normal. It is time for us as a nation to face the reality that we have an emergency on our hands. A catastrophe that must be decisively dealt with before it snowballs into an existential crisis. “We must stop treating these acts of criminality with kid gloves. Enough is enough! There must be safety of lives and property in our citadels of learning, because without it, there would be loss of confidence in the sector, which will result in low enrolment rates in a country that is amongst the highest statistically for out-of-school children. “I renew the call I made on Monday, March 15, 2021, for a state of emergency to be declared on the education sector, and for 24 hour armed guards to be posted at all schools in the affected states. “Yes, it is an expensive venture. Nevertheless, we must accept that whatever we invest in preserving the lives of Nigerian youths is worth the price, as nothing is, or can be more valuable to us than our youths, who will take up the baton after we are gone.” To put the icing on the cake, the usually blunt Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, on Tuesday accused President Muhammadu Buhari of working for Fulanis to take over Nigeria. The Governor said: “What is happening now, to me, is very clear; Mr President is just working for these Fulanis to take over the whole country. “His body language is what is being played out. The body language, the action and inaction of Mr President shows that he is only the President of Fulani people; I have known this. “We are becoming a Banana Republic. If we have a President who gave the security agencies order to shoot at sight whosoever is having AK-47 and the Minister of Defence came out to say that they cannot shoot at sight. So who is the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces?” According to Ortom, the people of Benue are being overstretched and running out of patience due to the incessant attacks on their communities. “Mr President must rise up. He is the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and over the 250 nationalities that are in this country; Mr President is their President, we all voted him. “He has taken oath of office to secure the country and provide security for lives and property; this is unacceptable, this cannot continue,” he said.",other
192,"A Powell River, B.C., man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) opted for a medically assisted death last Tuesday after years of struggling to fund 24-hour care that kept him close to his son. Sean Tagert, 41, leaves behind an 11-year-old son. Tagert had been diagnosed with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, in March 2013. ""For years he endured the steady deterioration of his abilities, until suffering cardiac arrest in late October 2017,"" read a post on his Facebook profile written after his death. The disease had cost Tagert his ability to breathe on his own, speak, walk and feed himself. Speaking to CBC last year, Tagert shared his frustration trying to get 24-hour care at home. Vancouver Coastal Health offered him 15.5 hours of home care under the Choice in Supports for Independent Living program but not the 24-hour care he needed. Tagert was later offered as much as 20 hours per day, which his doctor said was still not enough. Relocation was not an option as that would have taken him away from his son, of whom he had partial custody. ""It would be a death sentence,"" Tagert told CBC News last September. Sean Tagert and his son Aidan watching television. (Tagert family ) At the time, Tagert said he needed an extra $263.50 per day to remain in his home. ""Ensuring consistent care was a constant struggle and source of stress for Sean as a patient,"" read the Facebook post in his honour. ""The few institutional options on hand, Sean pointed out, would have offered vastly inferior care while separating him from his family, and likely would have hastened his death,"" the post read. Sean Tagert gets a kiss from his mother Trish Mennitti. Tagert pieced together a suitable care facility in his own home, which included an expensive saliva-suction machine that was needed to prevent him from choking, according to the post. ""We would ask, on Sean's behalf, that the government recognize the serious problems in its treatment of ALS patients and their families, and find real solutions for those already suffering unimaginably,"" read the post. 'Funny, active and vibrant' In the post, Tagert's family remembers him as ""particularly funny, active and vibrant."" Tagert was born in Texas but spent most of his life in Canada. He grew up in Mackenzie, B.C., before moving to Powell River. ""Above all else Sean was devoted to his son, Aidan,"" read the post. ""Sean often said that Aidan was his reason for living, and had a close relationship with him right to the end.""

193,"In January, freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) claimed the world ""is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change."" But according to new data from NASA, one of the previously fastest shrinking glaciers in the world is growing again, calling into question the narrative that rapid climate change — i.e., global warming — poses a significant threat to the existence of the human race, let alone the entire planet. What are the details? For the last 20 years, the Jakobshavn Glacier in Greenland was one of the fastest shrinking ice sheets in the world, losing on average 1.8 miles of ice annually while thinning 130 feet per year, according to The Associated Press. But in 2016 something changed: The glacier began growing again, at about the same rate it was previously retreating, researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said in a newly published Nature Geoscience journal article. ""At first we didn't believe it. We had pretty much assumed that Jakobshavn would just keep going on as it had over the last 20 years,"" Ala Khazendar, the study's lead author, said, according to USA Today. More from the AP: A natural cyclical cooling of North Atlantic waters likely caused the glacier to reverse course, said study lead author Ala Khazendar, a NASA glaciologist on the Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) project. Khazendar and colleagues say this coincides with a flip of the North Atlantic Oscillation — a natural and temporary cooling and warming of parts of the ocean that is like a distant cousin to El Nino in the Pacific. The water in Disko Bay, where Jakobshavn hits the ocean, is about 3.6 degrees cooler than a few years ago, study authors said. In fact, the study said the waters in the region have cooled to temperatures not seen in more than 30 years. What does this mean for the future? While the development seems positive on the surface, it could spell bad news for the overall direction of the climate. NASA climate scientist Josh Willis, who participated in the study, noted that while the glacier's growth is positive, the study proves that glaciers are more sensitive to ocean temperature changes than previously thought, which could mean disaster in the future if the oceans experience sudden warming. ""All this is an indicator of how sensitive glaciers are to ocean temperatures,"" Khazendar explained to National Geographic. Meanwhile, University of Washington ice scientist Ian Joughin compared NASA's latest findings to that of the stock market. ""[The glacier's growth is] to a large extent, a temporary blip. Downturns do occur in the stock market, but overall the long-term trajectory is up. This is really the same thing,"" he told the AP.",other
194,"Iran Parliamentarians have moved a bill in order to protect the rights of children which includes a clause that lets a man marry his own adopted daughter considering the fact that she is 13 years old. However, activists of the country have expressed alarm that the bill sanctioned by parliament, gives an opportunity for the caretaker of a family to marry his or her adopted child if a court orders it is in the best interests of the individual child. Credits: Care2.com Iran’s Guardian Council, a body of clerics and jurists which reviews all parliamentary bills before the constitution and the Islamic law, has yet to give its final verdict on the controversial legislation. To the shock of rights campaigners, girls in the Islamic republic can marry as young as 13 years old if they seek permission from their father. On the other hand, boys can marry only after the age of 15. In Iran, a girl under the age of 13 can still marry but needs a judge’s permission. As of now, however, marrying stepchildren is prohibited under any circumstances. 42,000 children aged between 10 and 14 got married in the year 2010, as per the Iranian news website Tabnak. At least 75 children under the age of 10 were married in Tehran alone. Shadi Sadr who is a human rights lawyer with the London-based group Justice for Iran, told the Guardian website that she feared the council would feel safe and secure to put its stamp of acceptance on the bill while Iran’s moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, grabs the attention of the press during his UN visit to New York. “This bill is legalising paedophilia,” she alerted. “It’s not part of the Iranian culture to marry your adopted child. Obviously, incest exists in Iran more or less as it happens in other countries across the world, but this bill is legalising paedophilia and is endangering our children and normalising this crime in our culture.” She added: “You should not be able to marry your adopted children, full stop. If a father marries his adopted daughter who is a minor and has sex, that’s rape.” As per Sadr, Iran officials tried to play down the sexual part of such marriages, adding that it is in the bill to fix the issue of hijab [head scarf] complications when a child is adopted. An adopted daughter is likely to wear the hijab in front of her dad, and a mother should wear it only in front of her adopted son if he is old enough, Sadr said. “With this bill, you can be a paedophile and get your bait in the pretext of adopting children,” Sadr said. Some experts reckon that the new bill is opposed to Islamic beliefs and would not pass the Guardian Council. However, an initial draft of the bill, which totally banned marriage with adopted children, was not sanctioned by the council and it is feared that MPs introduced the condition for marriage only to satisfy the jurists and clergymen. This is the reason why Sadr fears it can pass the council this time. The bill drew huge backlash in Iran with the reformist newspaper, Shargh, posting an article warning about its consequences. “How can someone be looking after you and at the same time be your husband?” the article asked. Shiva Dolatabadi who is the head of Iran’s society for protecting children’s rights gave a warning that the bill implies that the parliament is legalising incest. “You cannot open a way in which the role of a father or a mother can be mixed with that of a spouse,” she said, according to Shargh. “Children can’t be safe in such a family.” Though the bill was passed in 2013 as per media report, the news is getting unnecessary attention on social media in 2019. Some netizens are still protesting on social media against the very bill.",other

197,"On Tuesday, radio show host John Fredricks stated that multiple voters in Georgia had called into his show to tell him that they were unable to cast their votes in the Georgia runoff election because they were told the voting machines were malfunctioning. The callers claimed the poll workers told them to put their ballots in a box and they would be scanned later in the day. Keep in mind the malfunctions were reportedly in deep red counties. The comments from Fredricks came during an interview with Steve Bannon on War Room Pandemic. ""Dominion machines in... 3 of the largest Republican precincts...are down...They are told they can't scan their ballots because the machines don't work...The pole workers are saying 'When it's fixed we'll scan it for you'...There's all kinds of red flags,"" said Fredricks. More voters on Twitter also sounded the alarm. “Just voted in Newton County Georgia,"" said one Twitter user. ""Heavy republican district.. When I went to place my printed ballot into the dominion machine, the poll worked said the scanner was broken and someone was coming to fix it, I placed it in the machine slot but not in the scanner."" The voter later followed up, tweeting, “UPDATE. I called @GaRepublicans hotline and the guy said they are already hearing about these types of problems!”

During the hearing, inventor Jovan Pulitzer stated that he could easily audit Georgia's election results with special techniques that would identify fraudulent ballots. Pulitzer explained how he has “no regard for the smoke and mirrors of how the machines work"" and would be solely focusing on the paper ballots. “I don’t care about the machine,"" he explained. ""I don’t even care about the code that was written in the machine. What I care about is that physical artifact [ballot] and that physical artifact has material differences district to district that should not be there.” Pulitzer shockingly claimed he could analyze 500,000 in just two hours.

198,"After 35 days of being replaced for vandalism, the memorial sign of Emmett Till has been filled with bullet holes again. What We Know: The Emmett Till memorial was put up by the Emmett Till Interpretive Center, and resides outside of Glendale, Mississippi. According to TIME Magazine, this is the third time that the sign has been vandalized. To drive up and see it like that, I was sad,” said Patrick Weems, a founder of the Emmett Till Interpretive Center in Sumner, Miss. “When we finally replaced it, it was an amazing feeling that this sign that had been obliterated was finally restored.” The memorial was placed in honor of 14-year-old Till who was lynched, beaten and tortured by two white men, and then thrown in the Tallahatchie river. He was accused by a white woman, Carolyn Bryant, of whistling at her. The men where acquitted of his murder, and she recanted her story decades later after Till’s death. It was not until 2007, 52 years after Till’s death that he received his first memorial sign. It only lasted one year, before the sign was stolen and never returned, New York Times reports. Several signs have been replaced since the first one was stolen. Another was also shot, and the newest sign was replaced in June. No one has ever been caught for vandalizing the signs, but Mr. Weems says, “My sense is that it only takes one person to do this.” Mr. Weems says that there are talks of a new sign being being designed and made out of steel to be better than before. The Emmett Till foundation continues it’s journey to preserve his legacy.",other
199,"MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin oversaw a test Wednesday of a new hypersonic glide vehicle, declaring that the weapon is impossible to intercept and will ensure Russia’s security for decades to come. Speaking to Russia’s top military brass after watching the live feed of the launch of the Avangard vehicle from the Defense Ministry’s control room, Putin said the successful test was a “great success” and an “excellent New Year’s gift to the nation.” The test comes amid bitter tensions in Russia-U.S. relations, which have sunk to their lowest level since the Cold War times over the conflict in Ukraine, the war in Syria and the allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Putin's hopes for repairing ties with Washington under President Donald Trump have fizzled amid investigations into allegations of Trump's campaign ties with Russia, and tensions have escalated as the U.S. administration slapped Russia with new waves of sanctions. The Avangard was among the array of new nuclear weapons that Putin presented in March, saying that Russia had to develop them in response to the development of the U.S. missile defense system that could erode Russia’s nuclear deterrent. From the left, Sergei Ivanov, Russian special representative on questions of ecology and transport, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Chief of General Staff of Russia Valery Gerasimov, oversee the test launch of the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle from the Defense Ministry's control room in Moscow, Russia, Wednesday, Dec. 26, 2018. Mikhail Klimentyev, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP In Wednesday's test, the weapon was launched from the Dombarovskiy missile base in the southern Ural Mountains.

201,"Chinese scientists believe the deadly coronavirus may have started life in a research facility just 300 yards from the Wuhan fish market. A new bombshell paper from the Beijing-sponsored South China University of Technology says that the Wuhan Center for Disease Control WHCDC could have spawned the contagion in Hubei province. 'The possible origins of 2019-nCoV coronavirus,' penned by scholars Botao Xiao and Lei Xiao claims the WHCDC kept disease-ridden animals in laboratories, including 605 bats. It also mentions that bats - which are linked to coronavirus - once attacked a researcher and 'blood of bat was on his skin.' Workers in protective gear carry a bag containing a giant salamander that was reported to have escaped from the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan in central China's Hubei Province in January The report says: 'Genome sequences from patients were 96% or 89% identical to the Bat CoV ZC45 coronavirus originally found in Rhinolophus affinis intermediate horseshoe bat.' It describes how the only native bats are found around 600 miles away from the Wuhan seafood market and that the probability of bats flying from Yunnan and Zhejiang provinces was minimal. In addition there is little to suggest the local populace eat the bats as evidenced by testimonies of 31 residents and 28 visitors. Instead the authors point to research being carried out withing a few hundred yards at the WHCDC. One of the researchers at the WHCDC described quarantining himself for two weeks after a bat's blood got on his skin, according to the report. That same man also quarantined himself after a bat urinated on him. 'The WHCDC was also adjacent to the Union Hospital Figure 1, bottom where the first group of doctors were infected during this epidemic.' The report says. And he also mentions discovering a live tick from a bat - parasites known for their ability to pass infections through a host animal's blood. 'The WHCDC was also adjacent to the Union Hospital Figure 1, bottom where the first group of doctors were infected during this epidemic.' The report says. 'It is plausible that the virus leaked around and some of them contaminated the initial patients in this epidemic, though solid proofs are needed in future study.' And as well as the WHCDC, the report suggests that the Wuhan Institute of Virology could also have leaked the virus, as has previously been reported by MailOnline. 'This laboratory reported that the Chinese horseshoe bats were natural reservoirs for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS-CoV which caused the 2002-3 pandemic,' the report says. members of staff of the Wuhan Hygiene Emergency Response Team drive their vehicle as they leave the closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city of Wuhan, in Hubei on January 11 The seafood market after it was locked off by police at the beginning of January 'The principle investigator participated in a project which generated a chimeric virus using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, and reported the potential for human emergence 10. A direct speculation was that SARS-CoV or its derivative might leak from the laboratory.' The report concludes that 'the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan.' It comes as the outbreak has infected more than 69,000 people globally, with 1,665 deaths in China - most of these in the central province of Hubei.",other
202,"Funding to help vulnerable children in England has been cut by nearly £2bn over the last five years, say charities. Early help by local authorities has been a casualty of government spending cuts, say the Children's Society and National Children's Bureau NCB. They say failure to intervene early means a greater cost to taxpayers later and will damage young lives. The government said it had increased early intervention funding. Early intervention funding - previously called the early intervention grant - enables local authorities to step in and help a child or young person who is vulnerable or at risk. The help includes advice on teenage pregnancy or drugs and alcohol, and help from children's centres and early years services. In a report - Cuts that cost: Trends in funding for early intervention services - research suggests that government funding for a range of early help services in England fell from £3.2bn in 2010 to £1.4bn in 2015. The charities say there are early indications, from a Freedom of Information request by the publication Children & Young People Now, that reductions in spending are set to continue for children's centres and services in 2015-16. A fund set up for the most vulnerable families in society, the Troubled Families programme, is expected to increase or remain stable. Preventing crises Experts in social work and child protection have suggested a potential link between the rise of child protection cases and the reduction in spending on early intervention services. Levels of demand on the child protection and care systems can provide some indication of the effectiveness of services that work to support families struggling to care for their children and prevent them reaching crisis point, says the report. Small child left aloneimage copyrightThinkstock image captionEarly intervention can turn around a child's life, says the report Matthew Reed, chief executive of the Children's Society, said: Early intervention and help for children of all ages improves their lives, stops damage, and prevents more costly remedial solutions in the subsequent few years. That's why we are calling on government to prioritise funding for early intervention and help for teenagers and children to make sure councils can maintain these essential services as we enter another period of austerity. If we keep cutting early help now it will cost us all dearly in the long run. A government spokesman said: Ensuring every child, regardless of their background, is given the opportunity to fulfil their potential is at the heart of this government's drive to provide real social justice. We have invested more than £2bn in early intervention services, including 15 hours of free childcare for the most disadvantaged two-year-olds and enough funding to retain a national network of children's centres, which are helping a record number of parents. We have given councils the freedom to use their funds on those services most needed by their communities.

203,"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has yet again been caught exaggerating ‘global warming’ by fiddling with the raw temperature data. This time, that data concerns the recent record-breaking cold across the northeastern U.S. which NOAA is trying to erase from history. If you believe NOAA’s charts, there was nothing particularly unusual about this winter’s cold weather which caused sharks to freeze in the ocean and iguanas to drop out of trees. Here is NOAA’s January 2018 chart for Northeast U.S. – an area which includes New England along with NY, PA, NJ, DE and MD. You’d never guess from it that those regions had just experienced record-breaking cold, would you? That’s because, as Paul Homewood has discovered, NOAA has been cooking the books. Yet again – presumably for reasons more to do with ideology than meteorology – NOAA has adjusted past temperatures to look colder than they were and recent temperatures to look warmer than they were. We’re not talking fractions of a degree, here. The adjustments amount to a whopping 3.1 degrees F. This takes us well beyond the regions of error margins or innocent mistakes and deep into the realm of fiction and political propaganda. Homewood first smelt a rat when he examined the New York data sets. He was particularly puzzled at NOAA’s treatment of the especially cold winter that ravaged New York in 2013/14, which he describes here: The cold weather really began on Jan 2nd, when an Arctic front descended across much of the country, and extended well into March. The NWS wrote at the end of the winter: The winter of 2013-14 finished as one of the coldest winters in recent memory for New York State. Snowfall across Western and North Central New York was above normal for many areas, and in some locations well above normal. This winter comes on the heels of two previous mild winters, making the cold and snow this winter feel that much harsher. Temperatures this winter finished below normal every month, and the January through March timeframe finished at least 4 degrees below normal for the two primary climate stations of Western New York (Buffalo and Rochester)….. Relentless cold continued through the month of January across the region. So why, he wondered, did NOAA have this marked down as only the 30th coldest winter (since 1895) on its New York State charts, with a mean temperature of 16.9F? Homewood compared the local records for January 1943 and January 2014 – months which, according to NOAA’s charts, had very similar average temperatures. What he found was that NOAA’s charts were deeply inaccurate. The 2014 local temperatures had been adjusted upwards by NOAA and the 1943 local temperatures downwards. He concludes: On average the mean temperatures in Jan 2014 were 2.7F less than in 1943. Yet, according to NOAA, the difference was only 0.9F. Somehow, NOAA has adjusted past temperatures down, relatively, by 1.8F. Now, Homewood has given the same treatment to the most recent Big Freeze – the winter of 2017/2018. Yet again, he has found that NOAA’s arbitrary adjustments tell a lie. They claim that January 2018 was warmer in the New York region than January 1943, when the raw data from local stations tells us this just isn’t true. So at the three sites of Ithaca, Auburn and Geneva, we find that January 2018 was colder than January 1943 by 1.0, 1.7 and 1.3F respectively. Yet NOAA say that the division was 2.1F warmer last month. NOAA’s figure makes last month at least 3.1F warmer in comparison with 1943 than the actual station data warrants. He concludes: Clearly NOAA’s highly homogenised and adjusted version of the Central Lakes temperature record bears no resemblance at all the the actual station data. And if this one division is so badly in error, what confidence can there be that the rest of the US is any better? Well indeed. The key point here is that while NOAA frequently makes these adjustments to the raw data, it has never offered a convincing explanation as to why they are necessary. Nor yet, how exactly their adjusted data provides a more accurate version of the truth than the original data. One excuse NOAA’s apologists make is that weather stations are subject to changing environmental conditions. For example, when the station sited at Syracuse in 1929 was located at what was originally just a sparse aerodrome. Since then, however, as Homewood notes, it has grown into a large international airport with two runways servicing two million passengers a year. Its weather station readings therefore will certainly have been corrupted by the Urban Heat Island effect: that is, its temperature readings will have been artificially elevated by the warmth from the surrounding development and aircraft engines. So you’d think, wouldn’t you, that to compensate for this NOAA would adjust the recent temperatures downwards. Instead, for no obvious reasons, it has adjusted them upwards. This is a scandal. NOAA’s climate gatekeepers are political activists not honest scientists and the U.S. taxpayer has no business funding their propaganda. Drain the swamp!",other

Contrary to what economists and big banks like Goldman Sachs said, Brexit has heralded a new wave of growth as Britain prepares to unshackle itself from Brussels Craig Mackinlay The verdict was a major reversal following earlier expectations that the country’s decision to leave the EU would deliver a massive shock to the economy. Instead, the data suggests that the historic vote had no significant impact on growth at all. The u-turn was being seen last night as yet another devastating blow to the “Project Fear” scaremongering campaign run by the defeated and embittered supporters of Britain’s EU membership. GETTY Forecasts for Chancellor Philip Hammond showed that national output will continue growing this year GETTY Craig Mackinlay said in just three months 'Project Fear had descended to Project Farce' And it came amid growing expectations in the City that the Government is preparing for a “hard Brexit” that will mean quitting the EU single market and imposing full border controls.

205,"If you needed any more proof that the migrant caravans at our Southern border are NOT what they appear to be, now these invaders are making a new demand. Now these “migrants” are saying “give us $50,000 each to return home, or else we’ll bust down your border,” as Fox News reports: Two groups of Central American migrants marched to the U.S. Consulate in Tijuana on Tuesday with a list of demands, with one group delivering an ultimatum to the Trump administration: either let them in the U.S. or pay them $50,000 each to go home, a report said. Among other demands were that deportations be halted and that asylum seekers be processed faster and in greater numbers, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. The first group of caravan members, that included about 100 migrants, arrived at the consulate around 11 a.m. Alfonso Guerreo Ulloa, an organizer from Honduras, said the $50,000 figure was chosen as a group. “It may seem like a lot of money to you,” Ulloa told the paper. “But it is a small sum compared to everything the United States has stolen from Honduras.” Now the solution is clear. Protect our border with deadly force, force these folks back home without a penny. Under no circumstances should these invaders be let in. A letter from the second group of about 50 migrants arrived at the consulate around 1:20 p.m. asking the U.S. to speed up the asylum process and to admit up to 300 asylum seekers each day at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in San Diego. Currently, around 40 to 100 are admitted. “In the meantime, families, women and children who have fled our countries continue to suffer and the civil society of Tijuana continue to be forced to confront this humanitarian crisis, a refugee crisis caused in great part by decades of U.S. intervention in Central America,” the letter states. Of the roughly 6,000 migrants who’ve traveled from Central America to Tijuana, around 700 have returned home, 300 have been deported and 2,500 have applied for humanitarian visas in Mexico, according to Xochtil Castillo, a caravan member who met with Mexican officials Tuesday. Now it’s time to use maximum force to remove these invaders from our Southern Border. Maybe the President should shut it completely until such time as Mexico deals with it.",other

207,"Historians may look to 2015 as the year when shit really started hitting the fan. Some snapshots: In just the past few months, record-setting heat waves in Pakistan and India each killed more than 1,000 people. In Washington state’s Olympic National Park, the rainforest caught fire for the first time in living memory. London reached 98 degrees Fahrenheit during the hottest July day ever recorded in the U.K.; The Guardian briefly had to pause its live blog of the heat wave because its computer servers overheated. In California, suffering from its worst drought in a millennium, a 50-acre brush fire swelled seventyfold in a matter of hours, jumping across the I-15 freeway during rush-hour traffic. Then, a few days later, the region was pounded by intense, virtually unheard-of summer rains. Puerto Rico is under its strictest water rationing in history as a monster El Niño forms in the tropical Pacific Ocean, shifting weather patterns worldwide. On July 20th, James Hansen, the former NASA climatologist who brought climate change to the public’s attention in the summer of 1988, issued a bombshell: He and a team of climate scientists had identified a newly important feedback mechanism off the coast of Antarctica that suggests mean sea levels could rise 10 times faster than previously predicted: 10 feet by 2065. The authors included this chilling warning: If emissions aren’t cut, “We conclude that multi-meter sea-level rise would become practically unavoidable. Social disruption and economic consequences of such large sea-level rise could be devastating. It is not difficult to imagine that conflicts arising from forced migrations and economic collapse might make the planet ungovernable, threatening the fabric of civilization.” Eric Rignot, a climate scientist at NASA and the University of California-Irvine and a co-author on Hansen’s study, said their new research doesn’t necessarily change the worst-case scenario on sea-level rise, it just makes it much more pressing to think about and discuss, especially among world leaders. In particular, says Rignot, the new research shows a two-degree Celsius rise in global temperature — the previously agreed upon “safe” level of climate change — “would be a catastrophe for sea-level rise.” Hansen’s new study also shows how complicated and unpredictable climate change can be. Even as global ocean temperatures rise to their highest levels in recorded history, some parts of the ocean, near where ice is melting exceptionally fast, are actually cooling, slowing ocean circulation currents and sending weather patterns into a frenzy. Sure enough, a persistently cold patch of ocean is starting to show up just south of Greenland, exactly where previous experimental predictions of a sudden surge of freshwater from melting ice expected it to be. Michael Mann, another prominent climate scientist, recently said of the unexpectedly sudden Atlantic slowdown, “This is yet another example of where observations suggest that climate model predictions may be too conservative when it comes to the pace at which certain aspects of climate change are proceeding.” Since storm systems and jet streams in the United States and Europe partially draw their energy from the difference in ocean temperatures, the implication of one patch of ocean cooling while the rest of the ocean warms is profound. Storms will get stronger, and sea-level rise will accelerate. Scientists like Hansen only expect extreme weather to get worse in the years to come, though Mann said it was still “unclear” whether recent severe winters on the East Coast are connected to the phenomenon. And yet, these aren’t even the most disturbing changes happening to the Earth’s biosphere that climate scientists are discovering this year. For that, you have to look not at the rising sea levels but to what is actually happening within the oceans themselves. Water temperatures this year in the North Pacific have never been this high for this long over such a large area — and it is already having a profound effect on marine life. Related: Apocalypse Soon: 9 Terrifying Signs of Environmental Doom Eighty-year-old Roger Thomas runs whale-watching trips out of San Francisco. On an excursion earlier this year, Thomas spotted 25 humpbacks and three blue whales. During a survey on July 4th, federal officials spotted 115 whales in a single hour near the Farallon Islands — enough to issue a boating warning. Humpbacks are occasionally seen offshore in California, but rarely so close to the coast or in such numbers. Why are they coming so close to shore? Exceptionally warm water has concentrated the krill and anchovies they feed on into a narrow band of relatively cool coastal water. The whales are having a heyday. “It’s unbelievable,” Thomas told a local paper. “Whales are all over the place.” Last fall, in northern Alaska, in the same part of the Arctic where Shell is planning to drill for oil, federal scientists discovered 35,000 walruses congregating on a single beach. It was the largest-ever documented “haul out” of walruses, and a sign that sea ice, their favored habitat, is becoming harder and harder to find. Marine life is moving north, adapting in real time to the warming ocean. Great white sharks have been sighted breeding near Monterey Bay, California, the farthest north that’s ever been known to occur. A blue marlin was caught last summer near Catalina Island — 1,000 miles north of its typical range. Across California, there have been sightings of non-native animals moving north, such as Mexican red crabs. No species may be as uniquely endangered as the one most associated with the Pacific Northwest, the salmon. Every two weeks, Bill Peterson, an oceanographer and senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Oregon, takes to the sea to collect data he uses to forecast the return of salmon. What he’s been seeing this year is deeply troubling. Salmon are crucial to their coastal ecosystem like perhaps few other species on the planet. A significant portion of the nitrogen in West Coast forests has been traced back to salmon, which can travel hundreds of miles upstream to lay their eggs. The largest trees on Earth simply wouldn’t exist without salmon. But their situation is precarious. This year, officials in California are bringing salmon downstream in convoys of trucks, because river levels are too low and the temperatures too warm for them to have a reasonable chance of surviving. One species, the winter-run Chinook salmon, is at a particularly increased risk of decline in the next few years, should the warm water persist offshore. “You talk to fishermen, and they all say: ‘We’ve never seen anything like this before,’ ” says Peterson. “So when you have no experience with something like this, it gets like, ‘What the hell’s going on?’ “ Atmospheric scientists increasingly believe that the exceptionally warm waters over the past months are the early indications of a phase shift in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a cyclical warming of the North Pacific that happens a few times each century. Positive phases of the PDO have been known to last for 15 to 20 years, during which global warming can increase at double the rate as during negative phases of the PDO. It also makes big El Niños, like this year’s, more likely. The nature of PDO phase shifts is unpredictable — climate scientists simply haven’t yet figured out precisely what’s behind them and why they happen when they do. It’s not a permanent change — the ocean’s temperature will likely drop from these record highs, at least temporarily, some time over the next few years — but the impact on marine species will be lasting, and scientists have pointed to the PDO as a global-warming preview. “The climate [change] models predict this gentle, slow increase in temperature,” says Peterson, “but the main problem we’ve had for the last few years is the variability is so high. As scientists, we can’t keep up with it, and neither can the animals.” Peterson likens it to a boxer getting pummeled round after round: “At some point, you knock them down, and the fight is over.” Attendant with this weird wildlife behavior is a stunning drop in the number of plankton — the basis of the ocean’s food chain. In July, another major study concluded that acidifying oceans are likely to have a “quite traumatic” impact on plankton diversity, with some species dying out while others flourish. As the oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, it’s converted into carbonic acid — and the pH of seawater declines. According to lead author Stephanie Dutkiewicz of MIT, that trend means “the whole food chain is going to be different.” The Hansen study may have gotten more attention, but the Dutkiewicz study, and others like it, could have even more dire implications for our future. The rapid changes Dutkiewicz and her colleagues are observing have shocked some of their fellow scientists into thinking that yes, actually, we’re heading toward the worst-case scenario. Unlike a prediction of massive sea-level rise just decades away, the warming and acidifying oceans represent a problem that seems to have kick-started a mass extinction on the same time scale. Jacquelyn Gill is a paleoecologist at the University of Maine. She knows a lot about extinction, and her work is more relevant than ever. Essentially, she’s trying to save the species that are alive right now by learning more about what killed off the ones that aren’t. The ancient data she studies shows “really compelling evidence that there can be events of abrupt climate change that can happen well within human life spans. We’re talking less than a decade.” For the past year or two, a persistent change in winds over the North Pacific has given rise to what meteorologists and oceanographers are calling “the blob” — a highly anomalous patch of warm water between Hawaii, Alaska and Baja California that’s thrown the marine ecosystem into a tailspin. Amid warmer temperatures, plankton numbers have plummeted, and the myriad species that depend on them have migrated or seen their own numbers dwindle. Significant northward surges of warm water have happened before, even frequently. El Niño, for example, does this on a predictable basis. But what’s happening this year appears to be something new. Some climate scientists think that the wind shift is linked to the rapid decline in Arctic sea ice over the past few years, which separate research has shown makes weather patterns more likely to get stuck. A similar shift in the behavior of the jet stream has also contributed to the California drought and severe polar vortex winters in the Northeast over the past two years. An amplified jet-stream pattern has produced an unusual doldrum off the West Coast that’s persisted for most of the past 18 months. Daniel Swain, a Stanford University meteorologist, has called it the “Ridiculously Resilient Ridge” — weather patterns just aren’t supposed to last this long. What’s increasingly uncontroversial among scientists is that in many ecosystems, the impacts of the current off-the-charts temperatures in the North Pacific will linger for years, or longer. The largest ocean on Earth, the Pacific is exhibiting cyclical variability to greater extremes than other ocean basins. While the North Pacific is currently the most dramatic area of change in the world’s oceans, it’s not alone: Globally, 2014 was a record-setting year for ocean temperatures, and 2015 is on pace to beat it soundly, boosted by the El Niño in the Pacific. Six percent of the world’s reefs could disappear before the end of the decade, perhaps permanently, thanks to warming waters. Since warmer oceans expand in volume, it’s also leading to a surge in sea-level rise. One recent study showed a slowdown in Atlantic Ocean currents, perhaps linked to glacial melt from Greenland, that caused a four-inch rise in sea levels along the Northeast coast in just two years, from 2009 to 2010. To be sure, it seems like this sudden and unpredicted surge was only temporary, but scientists who studied the surge estimated it to be a 1-in-850-year event, and it’s been blamed on accelerated beach erosion “almost as significant as some hurricane events.” Possibly worse than rising ocean temperatures is the acidification of the waters. Acidification has a direct effect on mollusks and other marine animals with hard outer bodies: A striking study last year showed that, along the West Coast, the shells of tiny snails are already dissolving, with as-yet-unknown consequences on the ecosystem. One of the study’s authors, Nina Bednaršek, told Science magazine that the snails’ shells, pitted by the acidifying ocean, resembled “cauliflower” or “sandpaper.” A similarly striking study by more than a dozen of the world’s top ocean scientists this July said that the current pace of increasing carbon emissions would force an “effectively irreversible” change on ocean ecosystems during this century. In as little as a decade, the study suggested, chemical changes will rise significantly above background levels in nearly half of the world’s oceans. “I used to think it was kind of hard to make things in the ocean go extinct,” James Barry of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California told the Seattle Times in 2013. “But this change we’re seeing is happening so fast it’s almost instantaneous.” Thanks to the pressure we’re putting on the planet’s ecosystem — warming, acidification and good old-fashioned pollution — the oceans are set up for several decades of rapid change. Here’s what could happen next. The combination of excessive nutrients from agricultural runoff, abnormal wind patterns and the warming oceans is already creating seasonal dead zones in coastal regions when algae blooms suck up most of the available oxygen. The appearance of low-oxygen regions has doubled in frequency every 10 years since 1960 and should continue to grow over the coming decades at an even greater rate. So far, dead zones have remained mostly close to the coasts, but in the 21st century, deep-ocean dead zones could become common. These low-oxygen regions could gradually expand in size — potentially thousands of miles across — which would force fish, whales, pretty much everything upward. If this were to occur, large sections of the temperate deep oceans would suffer should the oxygen-free layer grow so pronounced that it stratifies, pushing surface ocean warming into overdrive and hindering upwelling of cooler, nutrient-rich deeper water. Enhanced evaporation from the warmer oceans will create heavier downpours, perhaps destabilizing the root systems of forests, and accelerated runoff will pour more excess nutrients into coastal areas, further enhancing dead zones. In the past year, downpours have broken records in Long Island, Phoenix, Detroit, Baltimore, Houston and Pensacola, Florida. Evidence for the above scenario comes in large part from our best understanding of what happened 250 million years ago, during the “Great Dying,” when more than 90 percent of all oceanic species perished after a pulse of carbon dioxide and methane from land-based sources began a period of profound climate change. The conditions that triggered “Great Dying” took hundreds of thousands of years to develop. But humans have been emitting carbon dioxide at a much quicker rate, so the current mass extinction only took 100 years or so to kick-start. With all these stressors working against it, a hypoxic feedback loop could wind up destroying some of the oceans’ most species-rich ecosystems within our lifetime. A recent study by Sarah Moffitt of the University of California-Davis said it could take the ocean thousands of years to recover. “Looking forward for my kid, people in the future are not going to have the same ocean that I have today,” Moffitt said. As you might expect, having tickets to the front row of a global environmental catastrophe is taking an increasingly emotional toll on scientists, and in some cases pushing them toward advocacy. Of the two dozen or so scientists I interviewed for this piece, virtually all drifted into apocalyptic language at some point. For Simone Alin, an oceanographer focusing on ocean acidification at NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle, the changes she’s seeing hit close to home. The Puget Sound is a natural laboratory for the coming decades of rapid change because its waters are naturally more acidified than most of the world’s marine ecosystems. The local oyster industry here is already seeing serious impacts from acidifying waters and is going to great lengths to avoid a total collapse. Alin calls oysters, which are non-native, the canary in the coal mine for the Puget Sound: “A canary is also not native to a coal mine, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a good indicator of change.” Though she works on fundamental oceanic changes every day, the Dutkiewicz study on the impending large-scale changes to plankton caught her off-guard: “This was alarming to me because if the basis of the food web changes, then . . . everything could change, right?” Alin’s frank discussion of the looming oceanic apocalypse is perhaps a product of studying unfathomable change every day. But four years ago, the birth of her twins “heightened the whole issue,” she says. “I was worried enough about these problems before having kids that I maybe wondered whether it was a good idea. Now, it just makes me feel crushed.” Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist and evangelical Christian, moved from Canada to Texas with her husband, a pastor, precisely because of its vulnerability to climate change. There, she engages with the evangelical community on science — almost as a missionary would. But she’s already planning her exit strategy: “If we continue on our current pathway, Canada will be home for us long term. But the majority of people don’t have an exit strategy. . . . So that’s who I’m here trying to help.” James Hansen, the dean of climate scientists, retired from NASA in 2013 to become a climate activist. But for all the gloom of the report he just put his name to, Hansen is actually somewhat hopeful. That’s because he knows that climate change has a straightforward solution: End fossil-fuel use as quickly as possible. If tomorrow, the leaders of the United States and China would agree to a sufficiently strong, coordinated carbon tax that’s also applied to imports, the rest of the world would have no choice but to sign up. This idea has already been pitched to Congress several times, with tepid bipartisan support. Even though a carbon tax is probably a long shot, for Hansen, even the slim possibility that bold action like this might happen is enough for him to devote the rest of his life to working to achieve it. On a conference call with reporters in July, Hansen said a potential joint U.S.-China carbon tax is more important than whatever happens at the United Nations climate talks in Paris. One group Hansen is helping is Our Children’s Trust, a legal advocacy organization that’s filed a number of novel challenges on behalf of minors under the idea that climate change is a violation of intergenerational equity — children, the group argues, are lawfully entitled to inherit a healthy planet. A separate challenge to U.S. law is being brought by a former EPA scientist arguing that carbon dioxide isn’t just a pollutant (which, under the Clean Air Act, can dissipate on its own), it’s also a toxic substance. In general, these substances have exceptionally long life spans in the environment, cause an unreasonable risk, and therefore require remediation. In this case, remediation may involve planting vast numbers of trees or restoring wetlands to bury excess carbon underground. Even if these novel challenges succeed, it will take years before a bend in the curve is noticeable. But maybe that’s enough. When all feels lost, saving a few species will feel like a triumph.

209,"Global Hot Air: Here's a United Nations climate report that environmentalists probably don't want anybody to read. It says that even if every country abides by the grand promises they made last year in Paris to reduce greenhouse gases, the planet would still be ""doomed."" X When President Obama hitched America to the Paris accords in 2016, he declared that it was ""the moment that we finally decided to save our planet."" And when Trump pulled out of the deal this year, he was berated by legions of environmentalists for killing it. But it turns out that the Paris accord was little more than a sham that will do nothing to ""save the planet."" According to the latest annual UN report on the ""emissions gap,"" the Paris agreement will provide only a third of the cuts in greenhouse gas that environmentalists claim is needed to prevent catastrophic warming. If every country involved in those accords abides by their pledges between now and 2030 — which is a dubious proposition — temperatures will still rise by 3 degrees Celsius by 2100. The goal of the Paris agreement was to keep the global temperature increase to under 2 degrees. Eric Solheim, head of the U.N. Environment Program, which produces the annual report, said this week that ""One year after the Paris Agreement entered into force, we still find ourselves in a situation where we are not doing nearly enough to save hundreds of millions of people from a miserable future. Governments, the private sector and civil society must bridge this catastrophic climate gap."" The report says unless global greenhouse gas emissions peak before 2020, the CO2 levels will be way above the goal set for 2030, which, it goes on, will make it ""extremely unlikely that the goal of holding global warming to well below 2 degrees C can still be reached."" Not to worry. The UN claims that closing this gap will be easy enough, if nations set their collective minds to it. But this is a fantasy. The list of what would need to be done by 2020 — a little over two years from now — includes: Boosting renewable energy's share to 30%. Pushing electric cars to 15% of new car sales, up from less than 1% today. Doubling mass transit use. Cutting air travel CO2 emissions by 20%. And coming up with $1 trillion for ""climate action."" Oh, and coal-fired power plants would have to be phased out worldwide, starting now. According to the report, ""phasing out coal consumption … is an indispensable condition for achieving international climate change targets."" That means putting a halt to any new coal plants while starting to phase out the ones currently in use. Good luck with that. There are currently 273 gigawatts of coal capacity under construction around the world, and another 570 gigawatts in the pipeline, the UN says. That would represent a 42% increase in global energy production from coal. Does anyone really think developing countries who need coal as a cheap source of fuel to grow their economies will suddenly call it quits? So, does this mean the planet is doomed? Hardly. As we have noted in this space many times, all those forecasts of global catastrophe are based on computer models that have been unreliable predictors of warming. And all of the horror stories assume the worst. What the report does make clear, however, is that all the posturing by government leaders in Paris was just that. Posturing. None of these countries intended to take the drastic and economically catastrophic steps environmentalist claim are needed to prevent a climate change doomsday. As such, Trump was right to stop pretending. Whether you believe in climate change or not, the Paris climate accord amounted to nothing, or pretty close to it. Even the UN admits that now.

210,"According to NOAA’s own historical data, of the 50 U.S. state all-time record high temperatures, 23 were set during the 1930s, while 36 occurred prior to 1960 — climate change proponents are feeding us a fairy tale, and I’m sick of it… The maniacal sociopaths of the world may have won control of the narrative, but they seemingly have little sway over the will of the people. You need only browse the comment section below any “climate change” article or social media post to see the wave of folks resoundingly rejecting the scam-of-a-world-view assembled before them (one of the few positives of SM). The man-made global warming rejection is likely down to two things: the first being that the so called “scientific consensus” has been failing for far too long — you can’t start warning people in the 1980s that we have 10 years left to save the planet, only to keep repeating that prophecy for the next 4 decades. This is probably the reason our youth have become the new target — kids don’t have this history of failure to draw-upon when browsing the bullet points of the latest IPCC report -for example- meaning they’re far easier to manipulate. The second reason is likely the availability of climate information these days–namely historical data. Thanks to the internet, researching past climate catastrophes and comparing them to what’s happening today is a simple task. I’m talking about raw historical data, such as the number of deaths caused by a certain natural disaster, or the year and decade of the highest U.S. state temperature records: The raw data ALWAYS speaks for itself — out of the 50 U.S. state record high temperatures, 23 were set during the 1930s, while 36 occurred prior to 1960. But the powers that be have constructed a rather tenacious, loud, and bullish narrative–as on top of the world burning to a crisp, the story also warns that droughts and floods are becoming more extreme. Comfortably crushing that assertion, however, is another NOAA nugget named the Palmer Drought Index — a century+ dataset plotting the portion of the continental U.S. that is either very wet or very dry. What the index reveals is that there is no significant trend of increasing drought or flood: An uptick in hurricanes is another li(n)e we’re fed, it’s actually listed as one of the main results of human-caused global warming. But again, there is no dataset out there that supports either an increase or an intensification of severe storms. In fact, quite the opposite is true, with 9 of the 13 strongest hurricanes to make U.S. landfall occurring prior to 1965. NOAA data shows both the number of hurricanes and the number of “strong” hurricanes making U.S. landfall declining since 1900. NOAA data also reveals that the number of strong tornadoes has been declining since the 1970s. When folks are permitted to look at climate data prior to 1980, natural cycles ALWAYS reveal themselves. There are ups & there are downs, and there are ups & downs within the ups & downs — and not a single scientist on the planet fully understands the mechanisms involved, no matter what you’re told. Saying that, however, sensible and tested “guesswork” is the basis of science. Recognizing the climate works in cycles means certain things can be predicted — the Grand Solar Minimum is one such cycle. Warmth is good for life on Earth, for biodiversity — the peaks of past human civilizations have ALWAYS coincided with Grand Solar Maximums (Minoans & Romans, for example), while their downfalls have ALWAYS been marked by Minimums and the coinciding temperature drops low solar activity brings. We humans should only ever be concerned with the COLD. If only man-made global warming was real… but as with ALL OTHER fairy tales to have ever done the rounds, these fabricated worries are put in place to control you, to have you lose sleep over something you can’t quite understand, and to have you pay, in one way or another, for your sins… Social Media channels are restricting Electroverse’s reach — be sure to subscribe to receive new post notifications by email (the box is located in the sidebar >>> or scroll down if on mobile).

211,"Bois State University told The Daily Wire Thursday that despite Wilson identifying himself as a student and an associate professor at the school, he is “not a current student nor employee of the university.” Original story: A Black Lives Matter activist in Boise, Idaho, has been arrested in connection to a vandalized statue of former President Abraham Lincoln. Terry Joe Wilson, 37, was arrested late Tuesday night after a warrant was issued for his arrest last week, The Idaho Statesman reported. Wilson has identified himself online as an associate professor at Boise State University and has been described by the press as the Boise Black Lives Matter chapter spokesman. Both physical and electronic evidence were reportedly used to identify suspects in the vandalism incident, which occurred in February. “[T]he bronze statue of Lincoln in Julia Davis Park — known as ‘Seated Lincoln’ — vandalized with feces, paint and signs,” The Idaho Statesman reported. “Parks and recreation staff were able to clean the statue, which was not permanently damaged.” The suspect fled from officers when he was first approached for his arrest, the Boise Police Department said. When he was tracked down, Wilson was found in possession of a firearm, marijuana, and drug paraphernalia. “Officers chased after Wilson and were able to stop him and take him into custody, at which time Wilson was found to be in possession of a firearm, marijuana and drug paraphernalia,” said a press release from the department. “Wilson was taken to the hospital and was medically cleared before being booked into the Ada County Jail.” “Wilson was charged with several misdemeanor counts, including injuring monuments, ornaments and public improvements, resisting and obstructing officers, possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia,” The Idaho Statesman reported. An account for Wilson describes himself as an associate professor at Boise State University.On Wilson’s Instagram page, one captioned photo from November railing against “fascist Donald Tump and neoliberal Joe Biden” identifies himself as “a student & faculty” at the university. The post, which also includes support for Black Lives Matter, reads as follows: Like the fascist @realdonaldtrump, the neoliberal @joebiden wants to increase police funding despite decades of research to support the position that police do not prevent crime. In-fact policing perpetuates crime & criminality with the support of the courts and corrections. As a student & faculty, I take matters on campus very seriously, not only for the safety of our students, but staff and faculty. The discussion around contemporary policing needs endless improvement, b/c the decision not to impeach current ASBSU President over concerns of anti-blackness under the guise of public safety is an absolute travesty.

The outlines had red smears over where the hearts would be.” The report added: “Terry Wilson II, the spokesperson for the Boise chapter, said in a phone call the demonstration at Clegg’s home was because she was one of the four council members who voted to approve Mayor Lauren McLean’s 2021 budget. The 2021 budget allocates more money for the Boise Police Department, even though the overall budget decreased from 2020. … Wilson said the chapter wanted to hold Clegg accountable for her vote, which he called ‘bad policy.'” More arrests in connection to the vandalism incident are expected to be forthcoming.",other

According to EBC Dongsen News, the patient reluctantly admitted she had drank a bubble tea five days earlier; however, the doctor who treated her said it would have taken a lot more boba to get to this point. The doctor prescribed laxatives for the girl to get the undigested pearls out of her system. As EBC Dongsen News reports, the director of Zhuji People’s Hospital’s emergency department said that boba, being made of tapioca starch, are already difficult to digest, but some makers also use thickeners and preservatives, the significant consumption of which may lead to gastrointestinal problems.

US constitutional experts responded that she would have to renounce her title if she wanted to hold public office in the States, because it would cut across the US oath of allegiance. Buckingham Palace tried to distance the Royal Family from the remarks made during the US election by issuing a statement saying that 'the Duke is not a working member of the Royal Family' and describing his comments as 'made in a personal capacity'.

215,"It was an accurate and judicious answer, so naturally it sent climate alarmists into paroxysms of condemnation. The Washington Post slammed Pruitt as a “denier” driven by “unreason.” Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii called Pruitt’s views “extreme” and “irresponsible” — proof of his unfitness to head the EPA. Gina McCarthy, who ran the agency under President Obama, bewailed the danger global warming poses “to all of us who call Earth home,” and said she couldn’t “imagine what additional information [Pruitt] might want from scientists” in order to understand that. Replied Pruitt: “No. I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact. So no — I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. But we don’t know that yet. We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis.” ‘Do you believe,” CNBC’s Joe Kernen asked Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency’s new director, in an interview last Thursday, “that it’s been proven that CO2 is the primary control knob for climate?” Yet for all the hyperventilating, Pruitt’s answer to the question he was asked — whether carbon dioxide is the climate’s “primary control knob” — was entirely sound. “We don’t know that yet,” he said. We don’t. CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases. By contrast, carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere: about 400 ppm (parts per million), or 0.04 percent. Moreover, its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm. Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red. A second coat of paint has much less of an effect, while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all. Advertisement There is a popular theory that atmospheric CO2 amplifies the creation of water vapor, thereby increasing warming through a “positive feedback loop.” But that theory so far is mostly speculative; climate projections using models based on it have consistently failed, nearly always predicting far more warming than has occurred. It should go without saying that if scientists cannot yet make accurate predictions about future climate change, then their understanding of climate science remains highly incomplete. Advertisement Earth’s climate system is unfathomably complex. It is affected by innumerable interacting variables, atmospheric CO2 levels being just one. The more variables there are in any system or train of events, the lower the probability of all of them coming to pass. Your odds of correctly guessing the outcome of a flipped coin are 1 in 2, but your odds of guessing correctly twice in a row are only 1 in 4 — i.e., ½ x ½ Extending your winning streak to a third guess is even less probable: just 1 in 8. Apply that approach to climate change, and it becomes clear why the best response to the alarmists’ frantic predictions is a healthy skepticism. The list of variables that shape climate includes cloud formation, topography, altitude, proximity to the equator, plate tectonics, sunspot cycles, volcanic activity, expansion or contraction of sea ice, conversion of land to agriculture, deforestation, reforestation, direction of winds, soil quality, El Niño and La Niña ocean cycles, prevalence of aerosols (airborne soot, dust, and salt) — and, of course, atmospheric greenhouse gases, both natural and manmade. A comprehensive list would run to hundreds, if not thousands, of elements, none of which scientists would claim to understand with absolute precision. Advertisement But for the sake of argument, say there are merely 15 variables involved in predicting global climate change, and assume that climatologists have mastered each one to a near-perfect accuracy of 95 percent. What are the odds that a climate model built on a system that simple would be reliable? Less than 50/50. (Multiplying .95 by itself 15 times yields 46.3 percent.) Is it any surprise that climate-change predictions in the real world — where the complexities are exponentially greater and the exactitude of knowledge much less — have such a poor track record? Pruitt got it right: Measuring human impacts on climate is indeed “very challenging.” The science is far from settled. That is why calls to radically reduce carbon emissions are so irresponsible — and why dire warnings of what will happen if we don’t are little better than reckless fearmongering.",other
216,"Climate crisis and logging is leading to shift from canopy rainforest to open grassland. Climate crisis and logging is leading to shift from canopy rainforest to open grassland. Much of the Amazon could be on the verge of losing its distinct nature and switching from a closed canopy rainforest to an open savannah with far fewer trees as a result of the climate crisis, researchers have warned. Rainforests are highly sensitive to changes in rainfall and moisture levels, and fires and prolonged droughts can result in areas losing trees and shifting to a savannah-like mix of woodland and grassland. In the Amazon, such changes were known to be possible but thought to be many decades away. New research shows that this tipping point could be much closer than previously thought. As much as 40% of the existing Amazon rainforest is now at a point where it could exist as a savannah instead of as rainforest, according to a study published in the journal Nature Communications. Any shift from rainforest to savannah would still take decades to take full effect, but once under way the process is hard to reverse. Rainforests support a vastly greater range of species than savannah and play a much greater role in absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Parts of the Amazon are receiving much less rain than they used to because of the changing climate. Rainfall in about 40% of the forest is now at a level where the rainforest could be expected to exist as savannah instead, according to the study, led by the Stockholm Resilience Centre, based on computer models and data analysis.
Last year, Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, was warned that the continued destruction of the Amazon by fire and loggers would bring the region closer to a tipping point where rainforest could turn to savannah. This year’s fires in the Amazon are the worst in a decade, with a 60% increase in fire hotspots compared with last year. Arie Staal, lead author of the study, said the ecology of rainforests meant that although they effectively produce their own self-sustaining rainfall in the right climate, they are also prone to drying out in the wrong conditions. “As forests grow and spread across a region, this affects rainfall,” he explained. “Forests create their own rain because leaves give off water vapour and this falls as rain further downwind. Rainfall means fewer fires leading to even more forests.” But if large areas of rainforest are lost, rainfall levels in the region decline accordingly. This reduced level of “atmospheric moisture recycling” was simulated in the computer models used in the study. “Drier conditions make it harder for the forest to recover and increase the flammability of the ecosystem,” Staal told the Guardian. Once rainforest has crossed the threshold and converted to an open savannah-type mix of wood and grassland, it is unlikely to revert naturally to its former state. “It is harder to return from the ‘trap’ caused by the feedback mechanism in which the open, grassy ecosystem is more flammable, and the fires, in turn, keep the ecosystem open,” he said.

They also looked at what was likely to happen if greenhouse gas emissions kept rising, and found that the ability of forests to grow back once trees were lost would be much reduced. Ingo Fetzer of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, co-author of the paper, said: “We understand now that rainforests on all continents are very sensitive to global change and can rapidly lose their ability to adapt. Once gone, their recovery will take many decades to return to their original state. And given that rainforests host the majority of all global species, all this will be forever lost.”",other
217,"(CNN) The stakes were high when Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren met at Warren's apartment in Washington, DC, one evening in December 2018 . The longtime friends knew that they could soon be running against each other for president. The two agreed that if they ultimately faced each other as presidential candidates, they should remain civil and avoid attacking one another, so as not to hurt the progressive movement. They also discussed how to best take on President Donald Trump, and Warren laid out two main reasons she believed she would be a strong candidate: She could make a robust argument about the economy and earn broad support from female voters. Sanders responded that he did not believe a woman could win. The description of that meeting is based on the accounts of four people: two people Warren spoke with directly soon after the encounter, and two people familiar with the meeting. After publication of this story, Warren herself backed up this account of the meeting, saying in part in a statement Monday, ""I thought a woman could win; he disagreed."" That evening in 2018, Sanders expressed frustration at what he saw as a growing focus among Democrats on identity politics, according to one of the people familiar with the conversation. Warren told Sanders she disagreed with his assessment that a woman could not win, three of the four sources said. Sanders denied the characterization of the meeting in a statement to CNN. ""It is ludicrous to believe that at the same meeting where Elizabeth Warren told me she was going to run for president, I would tell her that a woman couldn't win,"" Sanders said. ""It's sad that, three weeks before the Iowa caucus and a year after that private conversation, staff who weren't in the room are lying about what happened. What I did say that night was that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could. Do I believe a woman can win in 2020? Of course! After all, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 3 million votes in 2016."" Warren's communications director Kristen Orthman declined to comment. These previously unreported details from the two senators' private meeting shed new light on the careful efforts that Warren and Sanders appear to have made to manage their friendship and political rivalry even before the 2020 race was officially underway. From the start, even as both candidates were determined to capture the Democratic nomination, they were also keenly sensitive to the risk that their rivalry could divide the progressive movement. The conversation also illustrates the skepticism among not only American voters but also senior Democratic officials that the country is ready to elect a woman as president, several years after one clinched a major political party's nomination for president for the first time. Many Democrats believe sexism played a role in Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 general election, and voters say they are torn about whether to try again to put a woman in the White House in 2020. The revelation that Sanders expressed skepticism that Warren could win the presidency because she is a woman is particularly noteworthy now, given that Warren is the lone female candidate at the top of the Democratic field. And notably, their meeting in December 2018 came just weeks after a record number of women had been elected to the House of Representatives, helping to deliver the majority to the Democrats. Democrats have been intensely debating questions of identity and representation in recent years, and the party's historically diverse field of White House candidates this cycle has featured multiple women. Sanders himself weighed in shortly after the 2016 election, saying that ""one of the struggles that you're going to be seeing in the Democratic Party is whether we go beyond identity politics."" ""I think it's a step forward in America if you have an African American CEO of some major corporation. But you know what, if that guy is going to be shipping jobs out of this country, and exploiting his workers, it doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot whether he's black or white or Latino,"" he said at an appearance in Boston to promote his book, according to WBUR ""Name your favorite woman president"" Warren has grown increasingly vocal over the past few months on the role of sexism and gender inequality in politics, including experiences the Massachusetts Democrat said she has endured in the years that she has been in public office. On the campaign trail, Warren tells voters the story of how some male colleagues have advised her to ""smile more"" and being discouraged from running for Senate in 2012 because she was a woman. ""Over and over, we are told that women are not allowed to be angry. It makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet,"" Warren wrote in a campaign email in November, with the subject line: ""I am angry and I own it."" Three weeks ahead of the Iowa caucuses, Warren is now the only woman polling in the double-digits nationally. A new CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll showed Warren in a four-way race in Iowa, along with Sanders, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden. In that survey, Sanders and Warren performed nearly equally well as the top choice among female likely Democratic caucusgoers, while Sanders and Buttigieg were the top choice among men. Last month, Warren said in Las Vegas that she had ""lived enough of my life with men, and it's mostly been men, telling me to sit down and be quiet."" Days later, she acknowledged that this was a dynamic she had experienced in the current campaign. Warren's rivals have also grappled with the issue of sexism in politics. Biden recently said on the campaign trail that Clinton had confronted ""unfair"" sexist attacks in the last election, and added: ""That's not going to happen with me."" Sen. Amy Klobuchar said recently that female candidates with as little political experience as Buttigieg would not have qualified for the presidential debate. ""Women are held to a higher standard,"" the Minnesota Democrat said. ""Otherwise we could play a game called 'Name Your Favorite Woman President,' which we can't do because it has all been men."" A fraying non-aggression pact The New York Times first reported over a year ago that Warren and Sanders met in Washington in December 2018. That initial report said that neither senator sought each other's support, and that they did not try to dissuade one another from running in the 2020 election. If Warren and Sanders agreed on a non-aggression pact of sorts that night, that agreement has become increasingly frayed. Over the last year, Sanders aides and advisers have taken to social media to criticize Warren on numerous issues, including ""Medicare for All,"" student loan debt cancelation and the ""wealth tax."" Some of his allies have also implicitly and explicitly gone after Warren on the broader question of who has the rightful claim to the progressive mantle in 2020. ""People have to decide do they want originals or do they want copies,"" Nina Turner, Sanders' campaign co-chair, told CNN over the summer. ""He's the original."" Politico reported over the weekend on the Sanders campaign's talking points instructing volunteers to say that Warren's supporters are ""highly-educated, more affluent people who are going to show up and vote Democratic no matter what"" and that ""she's bringing no new bases into the Democratic Party."" Campaigning in Marshalltown, Iowa, Warren told reporters that she was ""disappointed to hear that Bernie is sending his volunteers out to trash me."" ""Bernie knows me, and has known me for a long time,"" Warren said. ""He knows who I am, where I come from, what I have worked on and fought for, and the coalition and grassroots movement we're trying to build."" Sanders himself appeared to distance himself from the memo, saying on Sunday that his campaign has ""hundreds of employees"" and that ""people sometimes say things that they shouldn't."" ""I have never said a negative word about Elizabeth Warren, who is a friend of mine,"" Sanders said. UPDATE: This story has been updated with Warren's statement after publication backing up sources' accounts.",other

Liberty Counsel — a law firm focused on religious freedom — caught wind of a Nebraska elementary school principal who banned a long list of Christmas-related items, among them candy canes because the ""J"" shape stands ""for Jesus."" Liberty Counsel — a law firm focused on religious freedom — caught wind of a Nebraska elementary school principal who banned a long list of Christmas-related items. Special: What kinds of items, you ask? Liberty Counsel provided a memo from principal Jennifer Sinclair that spelled out in detail all the verboten paraphernalia at Manchester Elementary School in Omaha: Santas or Christmas items (clip art) on worksheets Christmas trees in classrooms Elf on the Shelf — that's Christmas-related Singing Christmas carols Playing Christmas music Sending a Scholastic book that is a Christmas book — that's Christmas-related Making a Christmas ornament as a gift —This assumes that the family has a Christmas tree which assumes they celebrate Christmas. I challenge the thought of, ""Well they can just hang it somewhere else."" Candy Cane — that's Christmas-related. Historically, the shape is a ""J"" for Jesus. The red is for the blood of Christ, and the white is a symbol of his resurrection. This would also include different colored candy canes.

Howard Santa Claus School workshop on Oct. 17, 2008, in Midland, Michigan. What was the principal's reasoning? Sinclair — who's in her first year as Manchester's principal — noted in the memo that she ""come[s] from a place that Christmas and the like are not allowed in schools"" and that ""as a public school"" Manchester Elementary will be seek to be ""inclusive and culturally sensitive to all of our students."" ""I have unknowingly awoken a 'sleeping giant' with many of you,"" she added. ""I apologize for the stress that 'Christmas/holiday/ Grinch/Santa/tree' emails and conversations have caused you."" What items were allowed? The ""acceptable practices"" included: Gifts to students Students making a gift for a loved one Snowmen, snow women, snow people, snowflakes Gingerbread people Holidays Around the World — purposeful presentation of information to teach about different cultures Sledding Hot chocolate Polar Bears Penguins Scarves, boots, earmuffs, and hats Yetis Olaf — ""Frozen"" Yetis are abominable snowmen (er, snow people, if we're being careful), and Olaf is a snowman from the movie ""Frozen.""

""I'm hopeful we can avoid the discomfort of me directly questioning something you've copied, posted and had your kids do. That makes me uncomfortable, and I know it doesn't feel good."" She signed the memo, ""The (Unintentional) Grinch who stole Christmas (from Manchester)."" What happened next? Liberty Counsel sent a demand letter to the superintendent of Elkhorn Public Schools about the Christmas ban, urging it to ""immediately overrule and specifically disavow the sweeping directive banning Christmas holiday items, and require Principal Sinclair to undertake review of District policy and the law."" How did the district respond? Believe it or not, the district's response to Liberty Counsel said it had ""investigated this matter and determined that Principal Sinclair's memorandum did not comply with Board Policy"" and that Manchester staffers were advised that ""certain Christmas symbols"" are permissible. What did Liberty Counsel have to say? ""We are pleased that Elkhorn Public Schools promptly reversed Principal Jennifer Sinclair's unconstitutional directive, and required compliance with the Constitution,"" Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, said in a statement. ""The First Amendment does not require elimination of Christmas. Nothing prohibits public schools from teaching objectively about Christmas or other holidays with religious significance, from displaying religious and secular Christmas symbols side-by-side or singing sacred and secular Christmas songs together. The First Amendment prohibits censorship based on religious viewpoint. This outrageous three-page memo by Principal Sinclair was not based on ignorance of the law but hatred toward Christianity and Christmas. Principal Sinclair should issue an apology to her teachers and staff."" UPDATE, 1:28 p.m. Dec. 6: A school district spokesperson told TheBlaze that Sinclair issued an apology. The spokesperson also noted the district's statement on the matter: ""Elkhorn Public Schools District administration promptly addressed the issue at Manchester Elementary School regarding the memo that was sent by the principal to Manchester elementary staff. The memo does not reflect the policy of Elkhorn Public Schools regarding holiday symbols in the school. The District has since clarified expectations and provided further direction to staff in alignment with District policy. This issue was limited to Manchester Elementary School and did not arise at any other schools within the District.""",other

223,"The phone number to report Iowa caucus results was posted on a fringe internet message board on Monday night along with encouragement to “clog the lines,” an indication that jammed phone lines that left some caucus managers on hold for hours may have in part been due to prank calls. An Iowa Democratic Party official said the influx of calls to the reporting hotline included “supporters of President Trump who called to express their displeasure with the Democratic Party.” The party official’s comments were first reported late Wednesday by Bloomberg News. Users on a politics-focused section of the fringe 4chan message board repeatedly posted the phone number for the Iowa Democratic Party, which was found by a simple Google search, both as screenshots and in plain text, alongside instructions. ""They have to call in the results now. Very long hold times being reported. Phone line being clogged,"" one user posted at about 11 p.m. ET on Monday, three hours after the caucuses began. ""Uh oh how unfortunate it would be for a bunch of mischief makers to start clogging the lines,"" responded another anonymous user, sarcastically. Some users chimed in, posting alleged wait times on hold, imploring others to “clog the lines [and] make the call lads.” Rob Sand, state auditor of Iowa, said he took results calls on Monday night as a volunteer and received an influx of calls that appeared to have been generated by a post on the internet. “A lot of calls came in at a certain point where it was clear somebody had published the hotline number somewhere,” Sand said. He cautioned that he could not speak for other people who were taking calls and said he did not get any calls that said they were from Trump supporters. He added that the system prevented people from reporting fake results. He also said he was able to identify fake calls quickly. “If I picked up the phone and it was clear after the first handful of words that someone was not calling to report the results, I just hung up,” Sand said. Mandy McClure, communications director for the Iowa Democratic Party, confirmed that the hotline received “an unusually high volume of inbound phone calls to its caucus hotline, including supporters of President Trump.” “The unexplained, and at times hostile, calls contributed to the delay in the Iowa Democratic Party’s collection of results, but in no way affected the integrity of information gathered or the accuracy of data sets reported,” McClure said in a statement. The telephone reporting problems added to other issues, notably a smartphone app that did not work for some people and that also had a coding problem that prevented results from being reported properly, pushing more caucus volunteers to the phone lines. Iowa Democratic Party officials said that party staff members and volunteers flagged and subsequently blocked repeat callers who appeared to be reaching out in an attempt to interfere with their reporting duties. These included callers who would hang up immediately after being connected and callers who expressed support for Trump and displeasure with the Democratic Party. It’s unclear how many prank calls the party received or how much they contributed to wait times. Some calls came from Iowans looking to confirm details of their evening’s caucus, party officials said. The party has not responded to requests for information on how many individuals were manning the phone lines on Monday night. The Trump campaign denied any affiliation with people clogging phone lines on Monday night. “We don’t know anything about this, but perhaps Democrats should consider using an app that works,"" communications director Tim Murtaugh said. ""It's laughable that they would try to blame Trump for their own incompetence."" Several officials at caucuses attended by NBC News reporters struggled with lengthy hold times that made it impossible for them to report results. 4chan, which hosts an anonymous and often extremist politics board called /pol/ whose users have largely supported Trump since 2015, is known for extensive online political trolling and targeted harassment campaigns. On debate nights, 4chan users often direct one another to swarm and manipulate specific online polls on other websites with repeat votes, a practice known as “brigading” in online communities. The polls would then be used by politicians and partisan websites to claim shocking upsets. Users on 4chan are anonymous, and usernames are randomly generated with each new thread. Some users on 4chan pushed back against users claiming to spam phone lines on Monday night. One user said he didn’t want other trolls “making us the scapegoat for the DNC.” “I can’t wait for the news headlines saying nefarious trolls ruined the caucus,” another added. Two precinct chairs said they were unaware of any interference with the hotline and doubted it made much of an impact. “I wouldn’t blame the Republicans,” said Tom Courtney, co-chair of the Des Moines County Democratic Party and a precinct chair. “I’d love to blame the Republicans and the Trumpers, but I don’t know.” Mike Carberry, chair for a precinct in Iowa City, also said he doubted prank calls were the primary reason for long wait times. “I’m sure that they got some calls, but those could be sorted through relatively quickly,” he said. Another hotline staffer who asked to remain anonymous said they were aware of the prank calls but that they were not the main reason that results were delayed. “It was definitely a problem,” the staffer said. “But it was definitely not the reason that results were a mess.”",other
224,"Diabetes prescriptions are costing the NHS in England more than £1 billion a year, according to figures from NHS Digital. The total cost of the prescriptions has risen significantly - by more than £422 million - in the last 10 years. Almost one in 20 prescriptions written by GPs are now for diabetes treatment. The biggest increases are seen in treatments for type 2 diabetes, which affects around 90% of diabetes patients. Robin Hewings, head of policy at the charity Diabetes UK, said the figures reflect a dramatic rise in the incidence of diabetes. The number of people diagnosed with diabetes has doubled in the last 20 years, and it is responsible for 26,000 early deaths per year alongside serious complications such as blindness, amputation or stroke. This data shows that diabetes prescribing costs £1bn, but it is estimated that the total cost to the NHS is over £10bn a year, so the real price we have to pay for diabetes is not medications, but the devastating and expensive complications. Mr Hewings pointed out that drug costs have not risen significantly during this period, and that the increase in prescribing costs is largely a result of the rise in prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes signs 'detectable years earlier' 'Postcode lottery' for diabetes monitors Diabetes 'info prescription' plan Presentational grey line The rise in diabetes There are now over three million people in England with a diagnosis of diabetes. The number has doubled over the last two decades and there are nearly 100,000 diagnoses per year. 92% of recorded diagnoses of diabetes relate to type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes, unlike type 1, is closely linked to lifestyle factors and is preventable through lifestyle change. Almost seven out of 10 men are overweight or obese 66.8% and almost six out of 10 women are overweight or obese 57.8% in England. Source: NHS England Presentational grey line Type 2 diabetes is caused by the body not producing enough insulin, or by the body's cells not reacting to the insulin that is present, resulting in high blood sugar. It may be controlled by diet, or by antidiabetic drugs or insulin, or both. Type 2 is caused by a variety of factors, some of which are out of people's control, but more than 80 percent is caused by obesity or being overweight. In overweight and obese people, type 2 diabetes can be prevented and reversed by losing weight. The NHS England figures also include the cost of devices used by people with diabetes to monitor their condition. Nearly £477 million was spent on antidiabetic drugs in 2017-18. Over the same year, around £350 million was spent on insulin, and £181 million on diagnostic and monitoring devices. Professor Jonathan Valabhji, national clinical director for diabetes and obesity at NHS England, said: Thanks to better diagnosis and treatment, the NHS is caring for more people than ever before with diabetes, and this new data highlights the urgent need to prevent type 2 diabetes from developing in the first place. The NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme has now reached over a quarter of a million people at high risk of type 2 diabetes.",other
225,"Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide has helped raise global food production and reduce poverty. National polls show that climate change is low on the list of voters’ priorities. For good reason: In the U.S., and for much of the world, the most dangerous environmental pollutants have been cleaned up. U.S. emissions of particulates, metals and varied gases—all of these: ozone, lead, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and sulfur—fell almost 70% between 1970 and 2014. Further reductions will come from improved technologies such as catalytic removal of oxides of nitrogen and more-efficient sulfur scrubbers. This is a boon to human health. But a myth persists that is both unscientific and immoral to perpetuate: that the beneficial gas carbon dioxide ranks among hazardous pollutants. It does not. Unlike genuine pollutants, carbon dioxide (CO2) is an odorless, colorless gas. Every human being exhales about two pounds of CO2 a day, along with a similar amount of water vapor. CO2 is nontoxic to people and animals and is a vital nutrient to plants. It is also a greenhouse gas which helps maintain earth at a habitable temperature. Fear of excessive warming from more CO2 in the atmosphere, including that released from human activity, has caused some people to advocate substantial and expensive reductions in CO2 emissions. But observations, such as those on our CO2 Coalition website, show that increased CO2 levels over the next century will cause modest and beneficial warming—perhaps as much as one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit)—and that this will be an even larger benefit to agriculture than it is now. The costs of emissions regulations, which will be paid by everyone, will be punishingly high and will provide no benefits to most people anywhere in the world.",other
226,"The NHS Long Term Plan, published today, will save almost half a million more lives with practical action on major killer conditions and investment in world class, cutting edge treatments including genomic tests for every child with cancer.  The blueprint to make the NHS fit for the future will use the latest technology, such as digital GP consultations for all those who want them, coupled with early detection and a renewed focus on prevention to stop an estimated 85,000 premature deaths each year.  Measures outlined by NHS leaders today will help prevent 150,000 heart attacks, strokes and dementia cases while more than three million people will benefit from new and improved stroke, respiratory and cardiac services over the next decade.  Patients will benefit from services ranging from improved neonatal care for new parents and babies to life-changing stroke therapy and integrated support to keep older people out of hospital, living longer and more independent lives.  The NHS Long Term Plan is also the first time in the NHS’ 70 year history when there will be a new guarantee that investment in primary, community and mental health care will grow faster than the growing overall NHS budget. This will fund a £4.5 billion new service model for the 21st century across England, where health bodies come together to provide better, joined up care in partnership with local government.  The commitment to tackle major physical conditions comes alongside the biggest ever investment in mental health services rising to at least £2.3 billion a year by 2023/24. Building on significant expansion in recent years, the long term plan will see around two million more people who suffer anxiety, depression or other problems receive help over the next decade including new dads as well as mums, and 24 hour access to crisis care via NHS 111.  The NHS Long Term Plan will also:  Open a digital ‘front door’ to the health service, allowing patients to be able to access health care at the touch of a button  Provide genetic testing for a quarter of people with dangerously high inherited cholesterol, reaching around 30,000 people  Give mental health help to 345,000 more children and young people through the expansion of community based services, including in schools  Use cutting edge scans and technology, including the potential use of artificial intelligence, to help provide the best stroke care in Europe with over 100,000 more people each year accessing new, better services  Invest in earlier detection and better treatment of respiratory conditions to prevent 80,000 hospital admissions and smart inhalers will be piloted so patients can easily monitor their condition, regardless of where they are  Ensure every hospital with a major A&E department has ‘same day emergency care’ in place so that patients can be treated and discharged with the right package of support, without needing an overnight stay.  NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said: “The NHS has been marking its 70th anniversary, and the national debate has rightly centred on three big truths. There’s been pride in our health service’s enduring success, and in the shared social commitment it represents. There’s been concern – about funding, staffing, increasing inequalities and pressures from a growing and ageing population. And there’s also been legitimate optimism – about the possibilities for continuing medical advance and better outcomes of care.  “In looking ahead to the Health Service’s 80th birthday, this NHS Long Term Plan acts on all three of these realities. It keeps all that’s good about our health service and its place in our national life. It tackles head-on the pressures our staff face. And it sets a practical, costed, phased route map for the NHS’s priorities for care quality and outcomes improvement for the decade ahead.”  Seventy years after the NHS was founded, the health service will expand care for patients and their families at every stage of life, supporting people to start well, live well and age well.  The NHS will be the first health service in the world to offer whole genome sequencing for children with cancer and young people who have a rare genetic disorder, in addition to adults suffering from certain rare conditions or specific cancers.  The new, individually tailored treatments will be introduced alongside cutting edge testing services that will mean three quarters of cancer patients are diagnosed early, when the condition is easier to treat, up from half at present, saving 55,000 lives a year.  Around 23,000 premature deaths and 50,000 hospital admissions will be prevented over the next decade by putting over 100,000 patients with heart problems through a healthy living and exercise programme every year.  Children and young people’s health will be a priority with the introduction of a new transformation programme to oversee delivery of commitments for the next ten years, from bringing mental and physical care together to services for 0-25 years so that care is timely and continuous.  A renewed focus on prevention including action to help people live healthier lives will stop thousands of people developing life threatening or limiting conditions, including the expansion of the Diabetes Prevention Programme.  And as more people live longer, care will increasingly be delivered in people’s homes or somewhere convenient, freeing up space in hospitals for those who need it most.  Ian Dalton, chief executive of NHS Improvement, said: “At the heart of the NHS are hard-working staff who pull out all the stops to care for patients every day. It is thanks to their dedication that the NHS is admired around the world and that it has taken great strides over the last seven decades.  “We need to build on these achievements and make the best use of the new investment to fundamentally reset how the NHS is run so that our growing and ageing population can get the right care at the right time and in the right place.  “This means breaking down organisational barriers to take a more holistic approach to how care is delivered and paid for, embracing new and existing forms of technology, recruiting and retaining the right number of staff, and shifting the focus away from hospitals to prevention and care in the community.  “Developed by those working within the NHS, the long term plan sets out an exciting roadmap for how we will do this together for the benefit of patients.”  Professor Carrie MacEwen, chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges said: “It’s good to have a plan which sets a clear direction for the NHS and tackles many of the issues the Academy has long been saying need to be addressed if we are to improve patient care. Our challenge now is to make sure it’s properly implemented and in this regard we, that is everyone who works in the NHS and patients who use the service, must all play our part if we are to make it a success.”  Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation said: “This plan is a welcome and significant step in the fight against heart and circulatory diseases, which promises to save thousands of lives in the coming years.  “The plan’s strong focus on improving prevention and detection of heart and circulatory diseases and their risk factors has the potential to make a huge difference, ensuring that deaths rates fall further in the future. In addition, better care and support for people living with heart failure will significantly improve quality of life for many.  “It’s now essential that work gets underway on making this transformational plan a reality.”  Paul Farmer, chief executive of Mind, said: “We are really pleased to see that mental health is such a key focus in the NHS long term plan and we welcome the £2.3bn set aside for mental health services. This is the kind of sustained investment we need to see to put mental health on an equal footing with physical health and, if delivered, this plan will make a difference to the lives of thousands of people with mental health problems.  “Everyone now needs to work together to develop the workforce needed and to deliver these plans and to ensure the money reaches the frontline. Local decision makers need to develop their own plans and the proof of delivery will be in the experiences of people trying to access the services they need.”  Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan, said:  “It’s been a privilege to work with NHSE shaping the cancer section of the long term plan. I’m delighted that cancer has continued to remain a high priority.

227,"Hospitals have axed 15,000 beds in just six years, leaving wards at ‘breaking point’, a shock report reveals today.  The dramatic reduction – equivalent to closing 24 hospitals – amounts to a 10 per cent fall in NHS beds at a time when the health service is under unprecedented pressure.  There are now just 129,458 hospital beds available for patients at night, down from 144,455 in 2010/11.  Critics say patients’ safety is at risk and blame the cuts on an NHS obsession with shifting care out of hospitals and ‘closer to home’.  The dramatic reduction – equivalent to closing 24 hospitals – amounts to a 10 per cent fall in NHS beds at a time when the health service is under unprecedented pressure  Health officials say patients recover more quickly if they are looked after in their own homes by GPs, district nurses and carers, but many surgeries and councils do not have the resources to care for people who would previously have stayed longer in hospital.  At the same time, demand for beds is soaring due to the pressures of a social care crisis, immigration and an ageing population, with many more patients succumbing to long-term illnesses and frailty.  New figures today will suggest the problem is likely to get worse. Regulator NHS Improvement will warn that despite being given a £1.8 billion cash injection from the Government last year, hospitals are on course for a £1 billion deficit by the end of this year.  The figures will spark a fresh debate about whether the NHS is contributing to its problems by squandering precious resources.  One report yesterday said hospitals had blown £2 billion by overpaying for items such as toilet roll, blinds and wet wipes, with items that could have been sent in one hospital’s internal mail being sent by Royal Mail instead.  The British Medical Association BMA warned that the loss of 15,000 beds ‘risked patient safety’ because nothing had been done to improve the level of care at home.  The lack of beds means hospitals are having to cancel operations at the last minute – including cancer and heart surgery – or send patients home before they have properly recovered.  Hospitals have axed 15,000 beds in just six years, leaving wards at ‘breaking point’, a shock report reveals today  The BMA report also highlights how the NHS has fewer beds per head than nearly every country in Europe  The BMA report also highlights how the NHS has fewer beds per head than nearly every country in Europe. The UK has an average of 2.4 beds per 1,000 population, compared to Germany 8, Austria 7.5 and France 6.  And it raises concerns over occupancy rates on wards. Hospitals are not meant to be more than 85 per cent occupied, but the report highlights figures showing that nine out of ten exceeded this over the winter. Several hospitals are 99 or even 100 per cent occupied with patients at much higher risk of infections and neglect.  Last week an inquest heard that grandmother Mary Muldowney, 57, from Crawley, West Sussex, died from a brain haemorrhage after three hospitals refused to admit her because they had no beds.  Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the BMA’s council, said: ‘These figures paint an even bleaker picture of an NHS that is at breaking point.  Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the BMA’s council, said: ‘These figures paint an even bleaker picture of an NHS that is at breaking point'  ‘High bed occupancy is a symptom of wider pressure and demand on an overstretched and underfunded system. It causes delays in admissions, operations being cancelled and patients being unfairly and sometimes repeatedly let down.  'The delays that vulnerable patients are facing, particularly those with mental health issues, have almost become the norm and this is unacceptable.’  The bed shortage is being exacerbated by the bed-blocking crisis, caused by the problems in the social care sector. With a shortage of home help and places at residential care homes, elderly and vulnerable patients are staying in hospital longer than they should.  Former health minister, Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb, said: ‘The situation is getting intolerable, with more cancelled operations, longer delays and those with mental health issues being systematically let down. The Government is failing to properly fund the NHS and patients are paying the price.’  Today’s figures cover all hospital beds, including those on general and maternity wards, as well as in mental health and learning disability centres. An average hospital has 634 beds, so a loss of 15,000 beds is equivalent to almost 24 hospitals.  Fiona Johnson, of the Nuffield Trust think-tank, said: ‘The extremely high level of bed occupancy in England’s hospitals creates pressure-cooker conditions for the NHS.  ‘The drive to achieve efficiencies by reducing bed numbers has become counterproductive, as there is no slack in the system to accommodate surges in demand and as a result procedures and operations get delayed.’  Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ‘The shameful reality is this overcrowding puts patients at risk and blows apart ministers’ claims to be prioritising safety.’  FAMILY DOCTORS ARE OFFERING FIVE-MINUTE APPOINTMENTS Family doctors are offering patients urgent appointments lasting only five minutes in a bid to meet soaring demand. A snapshot survey found several surgeries offering the same-day slots for anyone who thinks they need to be seen immediately. This includes parents worried about sick children or patients with chest pain or breathing difficulties. GP appointments in England usually last ten minutes and are already among the shortest in Europe. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, of the British Medical Association, said: ‘Five minutes is woefully too short. 'Nine out of ten GPs say they cannot manage in ten-minute appointments.’ Advertisement  An NHS England spokesman said: ‘Modern treatment advances such as minimally invasive surgery, fast-acting anaesthetics and medicines taken at home mean that the length of time patients spend in hospital has been falling in all Western countries.  ‘The NHS is highly efficient overall, but there are still meaningful differences in discharge practices and community support across England.’  The Department of Health said: Our hospitals are busier than ever but thanks to the hard work of staff, our performances are still among the best in the world. We have backed the NHS’s own plan for the future with an extra £10 billion by 2020.’",other
228,"Pressure on the government to help struggling Britons has intensified after a leading thinktank warned that falling living standards for the poor threatened the biggest rise in inequality since Margaret Thatcher was prime minister.  The Resolution Foundation said Theresa May would need to make good on her pledge to support “just about managing” households as it released a report showing that rising inflation and an end to recent strong jobs growth would hit the least well-off hardest.  Its warnings chime with other forecasts for a squeeze on family budgets on the back of sluggish wage growth, welfare cuts, rising global oil prices and the pound’s sharp fall since the Brexit vote. The drop in sterling has made imports more expensive and there are already signs that is being passed on to consumers, with inflation hitting its highest level for more than two years in December.  The Resolution Foundation’s study found that the current parliament would be the worst for living standards for the poorest half of households since comparable records began in the mid-1960s and the worst since the early years of Thatcher’s 1979-90 premiership for inequality.  Since its sharp increase in the early 1980s – a period of high unemployment, factory closures and a cut in the top rate of tax from 83% to 60% – inequality has broadly remained flat.  But the Resolution Foundation forecast that between 2015 and the next general election in 2020 incomes for the poorest half of households will fall by 2%.  That compares with a rise of 4% during the last parliament and 1% between 2005 and 2010 – the five-year period that included the deepest recession since the 1930s.    Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said: “Britain has enjoyed a welcome mini-boom in living standards in recent years. But that boom is slowing rapidly as inflation rises, productivity flatlines and employment growth slows.  “The squeeze in the wake of the financial crisis tended to hit richer households the most. But this time around it’s low- and middle-income families with kids who are set to be worst affected.  “This could leave Britain with the worst of both worlds on living standards – the weak income growth of the last parliament and rising inequality from the time Margaret Thatcher was in Downing Street.  “The prime minister’s focus on supporting just managing families is absolutely right if we are to avoid the next few years being like the 1980s without the feelgood factor.”  The prediction that inequality is set to start rising again is based on the thinktank’s forecast that while incomes will fall for the poorer half of households they will rise by about 5% for the richest fifth over the next four years.  The foundation blames the upcoming living standards squeeze on a combination of stagnating pay, rising inflation and the rollout of more than £12bn of welfare cuts. It emphasised that the pound’s weakness since the Brexit vote and other economic factors such as flat productivity growth were only part of the picture. The unequal nature of the squeeze would be the result of government policy on tax and benefits.    “The vote to leave the European Union does not, thus far, appear to have impacted on the macroeconomy or employment, but it has hastened the end of ultra-low inflation and increased how far it is likely to rise in the next few years,” the report said.  “But, in some ways regardless of the average level of household income growth, Britain is also actively choosing to increase inequality. Despite welcome policies such as the national living wage, the plans the new prime minister has inherited are likely to ensure that the proceeds of growth are shared unequally and many families made worse off.”    The thinktank sees inequality rising to record highs by 2020 on three different measures: the 90:10 income ratio, which is the income of a household 90% up the income distribution scale, divided by that of a household only 10% of the way up; on the 80:20 ratio, calculated in a similar way from those 80% up the distribution and those 20% up; and on the Palma ratio, the income share of the top 10% divided by the income share of the bottom 40%.  “All forecast measures show large increases in inequality over the next four years, with all reaching record highs by 2020-21. This is a starkly different pattern from the trend of the past 20 years, over which time inequality has been broadly flat or even declining,” the report said.    Underscoring the challenge for May’s government as it seeks to redress deep regional imbalances in the UK, the Resolution Foundation also highlighted persistent inequalities between south-east England and the rest of the country.  Incomes in the vast majority of the country were more than 10% lower than in most wealthy region, south-east England, its analysis found. North-east England and the West Midlands had the lowest levels of income, both 20% lower than in the south-east.  On the capital, the report added: “Contrary perhaps to received wisdom London is not the region with the highest income, and once housing costs are taken into account, incomes in the region are roughly 10% lower than in the south-east.”  A spokesperson for the Treasury said: “Living standards reached their highest ever level in 2015, and are forecast to be higher still by the end of the parliament.    “Millions of people are taking home more of what they earn thanks to the government’s actions to reduce income tax bills and introduce the national living wage. We are helping households with the cost of living by increasing the supply of affordable housing, banning letting agents’ fees, and freezing fuel duty, and our investment to boost productivity will raise living standards in the long run.”  John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the Resolution Foundation was damning: “Labour called on the government at the autumn statement to end the unfair cuts to in work benefits, while they were going ahead with tax giveaways to a wealthy minority, but Philip Hammond chose to carry on with the work of his predecessor.  “It is becoming clearer by the day that working families will be forced to pay for a Tory Brexit that favours the rich and not the rest of us, as our country faces its biggest rise in inequality since Margaret Thatcher.”",other
229,"  Doc calls for a return to negotiations By DR JONATHAN STANLEY 12th January 2016, 12:01 am Updated: 6th April 2016, 9:54 am  TODAY my colleagues are going out on strike.  It is unprecedented, threatens patients’ dignity and safety — and it is unnecessary.  For me, it’s also illegal. That’s why today, I’m calling — along with think tank the Bow Group — for the British Medical Association BMA to call off its strikes and return to negotiations to bag the settlement we all need.  Savvy tactics from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt led to the Government going in too hard in talks none of us can walk away from.  That’s why a ballot was held.  But even back in November there was no reason why the BMA couldn’t have gone to mediators Acas first before upping the ante.  No one can honestly say that doctors, or the conditions on offer, are the same as what they were when the ballot was called. For me, the strike mandate ended when Acas talks started.  READ MORE:  Corbyn’s mob in doc strike as Momentum sends lefties to join picket line  Strike by junior doctors could drag on ‘for months’, says union boss  Moet medics: High life of docs’ leaders who are heading up NHS strike  Just days before the current talks broke down we all saw BMA reps briefing the media about how badly the whole thing was going.  Union bigwigs close to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn turned up the heat and the talks, naturally, collapsed.  With little chance of Labour returning to power any time soon we are now seeing Corbyn’s “new kind of politics” — a return to direct action to undermine the Government come what may.  His friends inside my union are leveraging the trust and goodwill we’ve spent years building and are weaponising my colleagues and our patients.  There has been no attention given to the victims of recent floods, who have lost so much and had operations cancelled.  With these strikes going ahead it is nonsense to say we can diagnose and treat cancers on time or that we can continue to see those suffering with mental health problems.  And it is nonsense to say the whole profession is behind the strikes — so many grades weren’t even balloted.  There are many different voices saying how many patients may die from understaffing over weekends and over these strikes.  The research I’ve worked on with the Bow Group suggests that more than two hundred lives could be lost just over the three days of industrial action this month.  There is our human side to this debate too. Thousands of us have worked hard to get into medicine.  We see so many patients suffer from their illnesses and are privileged to be there to help them as best we can.  I’ve worked as a doctor since 2005. I see the devastation when an operation is delayed, the anguish when a cancer is picked up late.  Paying me any more or working me any less will never blunt what I see.  Fair wages are fair, and I support the BMA in arguing for them.  Talks collapse ... Dr Stanley blames Corbyn's 'new type of politics' for breakdown  Reuters 1  We all want fair pay through negotiation. But there are many aspects of safety the current talks haven’t even touched upon.  For example, changing our rotas so senior doctors can stay on two weeks more in August — when newly qualified doctors start — would help the new doctors begin their careers in a safer and more supportive environment.  I’m sick of hearing how my colleagues will leave the country if they don’t get all that they want, that they’ll somehow be forced on to a plane to the Great Barrier Reef.  No one is forcing anyone to do anything and we have a debt to repay.  Doctors are one in eight of all NHS staff but we get three-fifths of the training budget.  That’s great, of course, because we really do need the best training to treat you. But why can’t clawbacks be written into our contracts so that if we leave as consultants for warmer climes we must pay back our training?  It takes £400,000 to train a GP — and for surgeons and cardiologists it’s even more.  Two thousand senior doctors leaving the UK would cost us a billion. More than twice that number applied to work abroad just last year.  But with competition for training and for medical school so high, I have to admit we’ve been too easy on those wishing to walk off with the loot.  In fact, if we did close this loophole maybe Jeremy Hunt would have more money to spend on nurses, medicines and, yes, on increasing our pay too.  I have seen emails and briefings from BMA negotiators attacking the Government, calling Hunt a liar, calling for other unions and left-wing groups to join pickets.  I won’t breach confidentiality by publishing these documents, you’ll have to take my word for it.  These briefings are not in my name, and they don’t represent the views of most junior doctors I know.  They make it clear to me there are elements of the BMA that wanted a strike from the moment they got their ballot and have no intention of returning to talks.  Where does that leave the public?  Strikes, I fear, will increase in number and severity.  Maybe, in time for May’s local elections, Corbyn will ride to the rescue and save the day from the strikes he prompted. He may even reward some of his Labour friends inside the profession, but the end result will be a conspiracy against the public and the patients.  I support the BMA, I have been a member for ten years. It does vital work for doctors and, ultimately, serves all of our interests.  But it has allowed a few members with a radical left-wing agenda very different to the union’s own to hijack it.  I will lose friends in calling out this failure to avoid strikes where possible.  I remember my early days of training at Sheffield Medical School and its motto shines through: “The art is long and life is short.”  The standing, trust and legacy of the medical profession is bigger than this showdown — and it has to be. There is a difference between being a professional and an employee. This is an employee dispute, but we are professionals crucial to the life of the nation.  We need to start acting like it.  — Dr Jonathan Stanley is a junior doctor and a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. He is co-author of centre-right think tank the Bow Group’s latest paper on junior doctors’ pay.  ",other
230,"Our NHS is safer in Europe: #NHSsaferIN  14 Jun 2016, by Frances O'Grady in Public services  Today I’m proud to be joining NHS staff and supporters at a rally at Congress House. We’re coming together to say don’t risk a leave vote – Don’t risk our NHS. And there’s a lot to concern us, whether we work in the NHS or rely on it for our families’ health care.  To start with, there’s the potential loss of so many talented NHS staff from the EU. That could unleash a staffing crisis in the NHS.  Where on earth would our NHS be without all the staff who are so dedicated to it: The doctors, nurses and support staff? The NHS staffing roster includes 50,000 staff from the European Economic Area – including 9,000 doctors, 18,000 nurses and midwives, and over 2,000 other health professionals.  These are people who fill crucial skills gaps, and use their incredible knowledge and expertise to help save British lives.  Of course the government should be investing more in training opportunities for locals. Our government’s NHS bursary cuts have been the worst thing possible in dealing with a growing training crisis.  But migrants don’t clog the NHS up – they prop it up.  Yes, our NHS is at breaking point. Staff are over-worked and services are stretched. But that’s not because of decent, hard-working migrants who pay their way. Migrants are often younger people, less likely to need health services than the average UK citizen but still paying UK taxes to support them.  The NHS is in a staffing crisis because the government has imposed another five-year spending freeze. The Tories’ pay cap has created recruitment and retention problems throughout the service, which means more and more taxpayers money is wasted on agencies and management consultants, increasing our deep reliance on EU healthcare staff.  Across the NHS, staff are demoralized – fed up with too little funding to help the patients they care so deeply about, too many top down reorganisations and not enough ministerial respect. And fed up that their dedication is being taken for granted.  The EU’s Working Time Directive means we have rules that protect staff wellbeing, and don’t needlessly risk patient safety. We already have dedicated health staff putting in long hours, but many Brexit leaders want to overturn their rights to refuse excessive working hours and push them to work even longer.  And of course funding for the NHS depends on Britain’s economy doing well. Pretty much everyone agrees leaving the EU will hit the economy even brexiteers admit it would hurt in the short term, and that will put our crisis hit NHS even deeper in trouble.  Based on IFS analysis, if we leave the EU, the public purse is likely to lose enough money each year to fund the whole of NHS England for 3 months.  Of course not all the public spending cuts would fall on the NHS. But it could still be as much as £10 billion a year by the end of the decade. Equivalent to every hospital trust in England cutting 1,000 nurses and 155 doctors.  But the thing that gets me about the discussion of the NHS in this referendum campaign is the hypocrisy. Because when did the leading lights of Brexit ever give a toss about the NHS?  Does anyone really believe that Boris Johnson cares about the NHS? That’s the same Boris Johnson who is on record saying he doesn’t believe in a free NHS; and that if people paid for services, they’d value them more.  Or Michael Gove who co-authored a book saying the NHS is “no longer relevant in the 21st century”? Or Iain Duncan Smith, who has said he’d prefer a social insurance system? Or even Nigel Farage, who believes that within the next ten years the NHS should be replaced by private health insurance?  I don’t believe they support the NHS as we know and love it, any more than I believe they oppose the EU/US TTIP trade deal. If we came out of the EU, these men would sign us up to their own secret trade deals like a shot. We wouldn’t even know about the deals; let alone have the chance to change them.  But perhaps the Leave campaign’s most shameful fib of all is the claim that leaving the EU would mean more money for the NHS. Frankly, I was gobsmacked when I first saw the Leave campaign’s battle bus slogan.  As the Tory MP and former GP Sarah Wollaston said last week, when she defected from leave to remain: “it simply isn’t true”. Even if we trusted them to do the right thing with the cash, the sums simply don’t add up. They’ve been repeatedly slammed for it by the UK’s statistics watchdog.  The leave campaign are fond of saying we remainers are negative. To be honest when faced with a change that could cause such damage it’s hard not to be. But there are also positive reasons to vote Remain for our NHS.  Being in the EU helps make our NHS better. It means a common set of professional standards across the EU. And when you’re away for work or on holiday, British citizens get the right to free healthcare in other member states.  It also means significant funding for research and development into health. Just last year, the UK received £232 million of EU money – incidentally the largest slice of funding received by any EU member state. That included vital money for research at Great Ormond Street children’s hospital, University Hospital Birmingham and NHS Blood and Transplant services. It keeps the NHS at the forefront of healthcare worldwide.  So we have a choice to make. To build our NHS – or risk it. To back our NHS – or privatise it. And to celebrate and cherish NHS staff – or demonise and divide them. A vote to Leave isn’t just a big gamble with jobs, wages and rights, it’s also a big gamble with our NHS.  The NHS was built by and for working people. It is about solidarity, collaboration and co-operation. And it is too special, too precious, to entrust to the privatising Tories and UKIP, who are pushing Brexit as a way towards a deregulated, low-tax and low-services UK.  The NHS needs to be safeguarded if it’s going to be able to care for our children and grandchildren. I’ll be voting remain to do that.",other
231,"Rises in National Insurance Contributions NICS for self-employed workers have been criticised as penalising entrepreneurs.  Chancellor Philip Hammond announced in the Budget that the rate for Class 4 NICS would rise from 9% to 10% in April 2018, and to 11% in 2019.  That compares to 12% currently paid by employees.  The difference in National Insurance Contributions is no longer justified, Mr Hammond said.  Self-employed people have traditionally paid lower NICS than employees, as they receive fewer state benefits.  But the chancellor said the self-employed now had equal access to the new state pension. He also said that the government would consult on parental benefits, some of which self-employed people cannot claim.  The chancellor said all self-employed people who earned less than £16,250 would be better off.  Around half of the 4.8 million workers registered as self-employed earn less than £13,000, according to the think tank the Resolution Foundation.  As a result it said most such workers - such as low-paid hairdressers - will be better off by 2019/20. line Winners and Losers hairdresserimage copyrightGetty Images      A self-employed hairdresser - with average earnings of £12,700 - will be £70 better off       A self-employed taxi driver - with average earnings of £17,300 - will be £20 worse off      A self-employed management consultant - with average earnings of £51,100 - will be £620 worse off.  source: Resolution Foundation line  But the rise, which will cost those affected an average of 60p a week, was criticised by entrepreneurs.  Increasing National Insurance rates for the self-employed could be a further step by the government to penalise those who are taking risks and starting a business, said Lucy-Rose Walker, the chief executive of Entrepreneurial Spark.  Others said it was unfair that the self-employed would have to pay more, when they do not receive the same level of state benefits.  Self-employees are subject to a lower national insurance contribution because they do not receive the same entitlements and benefits as their employed counterparts - such as holiday and sick leave, said Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of tax at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants.

Matthew Taylor, head of the Royal Society of Arts, is due to produce a report on how the self-employed are taxed later this year.

232,"Pupils in most secondary schools are being taught by staff not trained in the subject they are teaching, according to a new report.  A survey of 885 schools by the Association of School and College Leaders, which represents secondary school heads, reveals 73 per cent were having to put teachers not trained in the subject they were teaching in front of classes. In addition, 84 per cent said that teacher shortages were having a detrimental effect on the education they were providing.  The subject areas worst hit by what has been described by ASCL president Allan Foulds as a “national crisis” are maths where 78 per of schools are having to make do with staff not trained in the subject, science 75 per cent and English 57 per cent.  Other problem areas are languages with 33 per cent of schools using non-specialist teachers, geography 25 per cent and history 14 per cent. In all, 89 per cent said they were experiencing difficulties in recruiting teachers.  Last month, the National Audit Office revealed that the Department for Education has failed to meet its recruitment targets for trainee teachers for the past four years. The Chief Inspector of Schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, also warned last week of a “brain drain” as teachers opt for jobs in satellite schools abroad, set up by many of the country’s leading independent schools.  The survey coincides with the ASCL’s annual conference this weekend, at which the Education Secretary, Nicky Morgan, is expected to be put under pressure to take action on teacher shortages.  “Teacher shortages leave schools with no option other than to use stop-gap solutions,” said Malcolm Trobe, ASCL general secretary. “Supply staff and non-specialists often do a good job in difficult circumstances, but it is no substitute for having permanent teachers who are experts in their subjects.”  Please enter your email address Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP Thanks for signing up to the News newsletter {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

233,"A blitz on helping people with drink, drug and other problems find work is to be launched after it emerged they cost the taxpayer £10 billion a year.  Iain Duncan Smith revealed the figure yesterday as he promised a jobcentre scheme to identify the addictions which are stopping claimants find work.  Under the Universal Support regime, officials will take personal charge of each case to ensure they get treatment, mental health counselling and other support.  Iain Duncan Smith said it costs the taxpayer £10.1billion a year to support people addicted to drugs file photo  Once people have found a job, they will remain under the care of the jobcentre until they are doing sufficient hours to leave the accompanying Universal Credit benefits regime altogether.  The work and pensions secretary said the aim was to find jobs for people who had been ‘parked’ on a life on benefits by the last government.  Mr Duncan Smith added: ‘Too often in the past, people with complex barriers such as addiction, indebtedness or homelessness were written off to a life on benefits.  'Through Universal Support we are putting an end to this, and offering wraparound support for those that need it.  ‘These problems are the root causes of poverty – and if not tackled mean that the cycle of disadvantage will continue into the next generation.’  He pointed to a devastating report by the Lankelly Chase Foundation which found the wider cost to the taxpayer of supporting people with the most severe problems was £10.1 billion a year.  Mr Duncan Smith, pictured, has faced fierce criticism from the Church for his welfare reforms  There are 586,000 people categorised as having at least one serious problem – such as addiction to drink or drugs or homelessness.  Officials said the aim was to reduce the cost of social breakdown by addressing all the ‘barriers’ they face to getting on in life and finding a job.  One said: ‘This is not about cutting benefits – it is about reducing the need.’  Mr Duncan Smith revealed that, for the first time, the Department of Health had acknowledged that having a job improved a person’s health and well-being.  The new policy will allow people who claim mental health problems are preventing them from finding work to access more support.  In about 60 per cent of cases, the problem they have is anxiety or depression.  Help will also be available for people who have problems with housing, childcare, debt and a history of offending.  Mr Duncan Smith has faced fierce criticism from the Church and critics on the Left for his welfare reforms, which they claimed would create ‘unacceptable’ suffering.  But, following a raft of changes to the benefits system designed to incentivise work, the number of children growing up in homes in which nobody has a job has plummeted by 478,000.  The overall number of households where no one was in work fell to the lowest on record in 2015 – almost 700,000 fewer than in 2010.",other
234,"The use of cocaine in Britain has doubled in seven years, as one in 50 Londoners currently snorts the drug daily.  An analysis of Britain's waste water, carried out by forensic scientists at King's College London, has also proved that the purity of the class A drug has gone up, hitting a record high.  Tests of the drug in sewage show Londoners are taking almost 200,000 doses of cocaine every day, which amounts to about £700,000.  The research found that one in 50 Londoners currently takes the drug on a daily basis  Concentrations in waste water are 900 milligrams per 1,000 of the population per day, which rose from 392 milligrams per 1,000 in 2011.  The average cocaine dose through smoking or snorting is 40 milligrams, meaning that, in a population of nine million people, one in 50 is taking the class A drug on a daily basis.  The research also found out that the use of cocaine in London is almost as high during weekdays as it is at the weekend.  The use of cocaine in London is almost as high during the week as it is at the weekend  Last year, the Global Drug Survey reported that the British capital is one of cities in the world where cocaine can be delivered faster than pizza, thanks to the use of smartphones and encrypted messaging services.  London, Bristol, Barcelona, Antwerp, Zurich and Amsterdam are considered the top cities in Europe for the use of cocaine.  A study carried out by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in 2015 found that London was the city with the highest concentration of cocaine in its sewage in Europe.  Cocaine purity is soaring thanks to the increased supply and production in Latin America  Traces of the drug have been found in fish and shrimps in Suffolk.  A study published last summer found that endangered eels could become 'hyperactive' because of the presence of drugs in Britain's waters.  Biologists at the University of Naples Federico II also found that the the drugs accumulate in the animals' brains, muscles, gills and skin.  Dr Leon Barron, who led the latest analysis at King's College London, said the purity of cocaine has also risen through the increased supply and production in Latin America.  Recent research by the National Crime Agency confirmed cocaine purity is at 'historically high levels'.  Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan Police commissioner, said cocaine users often fuel gang violence and knife crime.  Pure cocaine is sold for about £100 per gram on the street.  Cocaine seizures have trebled in five hears, from 42.8 tons in 2013-14 to 122.9 tons in 2017-18, The Telegraph reported.  Dr Barron said treating sewage can remove most of the cocaine from waste water before it is recycled into rivers.",other

The delay in making a decision over where to build a new runway is costing the UK up to £6m a day, a report by a cross-party Commons body claims.  The British Infrastructure Group BIG, headed by Conservative MP Grant Shapps, urged new prime minister Theresa May to show her mettle by ending the speculation.  Its report entitled Gate Now Closing , which was published on Sunday July 24, calls for an urgent and immediate decision on hub airport expansion.  The report does not state where group thinks a new runway should be built, but it argues that the indecision is having a deleterious effect on Britain's businesses, the economy and jobs.  'Problem of capacity... causing substantial damage'  The problem of capacity at the current hub, Heathrow, is causing substantial damage to the industry as a whole, the report says.  It erodes confidence in the Government's stated ambition of growing the economy and our international trade.  The evidence has been gathered by the Airports Commission. Now a decision is needed, to show the new leadership's mettle.  The Airports Commission last summer recommended building a third runway at Heathrow over a second landing strip at Gatwick.  Still no date for Heathrow announcement  The Government's decision was initially delayed last year when further environmental studies were commissioned , and then in June following the outcome of the EU referendum.  The Department for Transport has not indicated when a decision is likely, following Chris Grayling's appointment as the new transport secretary.

237,"Teachers who leave the profession for other jobs are taking substantial pay cuts, a new study published tonight reveals.  The research by the NFER National Foundation for Educational Research looked at teachers who left for different occupations over the past 14 years and found that, on average, their pay dropped by 10 per cent, compared with those who stayed in teaching.  It reveals that some teachers – who left to become teaching assistants or who took up a job in the public sector – saw a drop in their wages of up to 30 per cent.  Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said she knew of a teacher who had become a bus driver because they felt “anything was preferable to the lack of quality of life” that came with teaching.  “The fact that teachers are taking lower paid jobs reflects the desperation that many teachers feel, she said. The relentless nature of the workload and pressure is leading to teachers just walking. They can see no way they can remain in teaching and so they lose professional status and money.”  But the NFER analysis, of the government Labour Force Survey LFS data, can only indicate how the teachers' pay has changed in the short term as the LFS only follows up individuals for one year.  The Should I Stay or Should I Go? report concludes: “The short-term pay benefits from a career move may be limited by the need to prove value to new employers and develop skills for a different career. The prospect of higher pay in the longer-term may still have been a motivation for some teachers who left teaching.”  The report added that it is “possible that career-changers from other professions experience a similar fall in wages and this phenomenon is not likely to be unique to teaching.”  According to the research, more than half 51 per cent of teachers who leave teaching take up jobs in the education sector excluding those who leave to retire.  Carole Willis, NFER chief executive, said: “Recruiting and retaining good quality teachers is a key issue facing the education system over the next five to 10 years. Understanding the types of jobs former teachers are going into and their underlying motivations is crucial for formulating an appropriate policy response.”  The NFER analysed a sample of 6,896 teachers, including 936 who left teaching and 774 who joined teaching, over a 14-year period 2001-2015.

Sign up Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice  There is no strong evidence that children under ten have passed coronavirus onto adults, researchers have suggested.  Young children do not play a significant role in spreading the virus and are significantly less likely to become infected than adults, according to a review of existing research into Covid-19 and children by the Royal College of Paediatricians and Child Health RCPCH said.  It worked with other research teams to examine the correlation in studies of transmission from children to adults after public health officials in Switzerland said today under-10s could finally hug their grandparents again as they pose no risk to them.  The review, by the Don't Forget the Bubbles paediatric research project, stated: Notably, the China/WHO joint commission could not recall episodes during contact tracing where transmission occurred from a child to an adult.  Image: REUTERS  But the review also urged caution as it is still unknown whether children have passed on the virus, particularly given large numbers of asymptomatic cases.  A nine-year-old British boy who contracted coronavirus in a French Alps did not pass it on, despite having contact with more than 170 people at three schools. This case was studied as part of the research.  Dr Alasdair Munro, the clinical research fellow in paediatric infectious diseases who led the research, said: Covid-19 appears to affect children less often, and with less severity, including frequent asymptomatic or sub-clinical infection.  There is evidence of critical illness, but it is rare.  The role of children in transmission is unclear, but it seems likely they do not play a significant role.  Professor Russell Viner, the president of the RCPCH, said: From around the world, we are not seeing evidence that children are involved in spreading or transmitting the virus, but we do not have enough evidence.  Prof Viner added that it was too soon to say children could hug their grandparents, particularly as the over-70s are the most vulnerable.  Note: Children are not believed to play a significant role in the spread of coronavirus. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that a study had found no cases of children passing coronavirus to an adult exist.",other

243,"Like what?  Helen Harwatt is a researcher trained in environmental nutrition, a field focused on developing food systems that balance human health and sustainability. She’s interested in policy, but realistic about how much progress can be expected under the aforementioned leadership. So she and colleagues have done research on maximizing the impacts of individuals. As with so many things in life and health, that tends to come down to food.  Recently Harwatt and a team of scientists from Oregon State University, Bard College, and Loma Linda University calculated just what would happen if every American made one dietary change: substituting beans for beef. They found that if everyone were willing and able to do that—hypothetically—the U.S. could still come close to meeting its 2020 greenhouse-gas emission goals, pledged by President Barack Obama in 2009.  That is, even if nothing about our energy infrastructure or transportation system changed—and even if people kept eating chicken and pork and eggs and cheese—this one dietary change could achieve somewhere between 46 and 74 percent of the reductions needed to meet the target.  “I think there’s genuinely a lack of awareness about how much impact this sort of change can have,” Harwatt told me. There have been analyses in the past about the environmental impacts of veganism and vegetarianism, but this study is novel for the idea that a person’s dedication to the cause doesn’t have to be complete in order to matter. A relatively small, single-food substitution could be the most powerful change a person makes in terms of their lifetime environmental impact—more so than downsizing one’s car, or being vigilant about turning off light bulbs, and certainly more than quitting showering.  Read: The economic case for worldwide vegetarianism  To understand why the climate impact of beef alone is so large, note that the image at the top of this story is a sea of soybeans in a silo in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest. The beans belong to a feed lot that holds 38,000 cattle, the growth and fattening of which means dispensing 900 metric tons of feed every day. Which is to say that these beans will be eaten by cows, and the cows will convert the beans to meat, and the humans will eat the meat. In the process, the cows will emit much greenhouse gas, and they will consume far more calories in beans than they will yield in meat, meaning far more clearcutting of forests to farm cattle feed than would be necessary if the beans above were simply eaten by people.  This inefficient process happens on a massive scale. Brazil, the world’s largest exporter of red meat, holds around 212 million cattle. (In June, the U.S. temporarily suspended imports of beef from Brazil due to abscesses, collections of pus, in the meat.) According to the United Nations, 33 percent of arable land on Earth is used to grow feed for livestock. Even more, 26 percent of the ice-free terrestrial surface of Earth is used for grazing livestock. In all, almost a third of the land on Earth is used to produce meat and animal products.",other
244,"The dramatic melting of Arctic ice is already driving extreme weather that affects hundreds of millions of people across North America, Europe and Asia, leading climate scientists have told the Guardian.
Severe “snowmageddon” winters are now strongly linked to soaring polar temperatures, say researchers, with deadly summer heatwaves and torrential floods also probably linked. The scientists now fear the Arctic meltdown has kickstarted abrupt changes in the planet’s swirling atmosphere, bringing extreme weather in heavily populated areas to the boil. The northern ice cap has been shrinking since the 1970s, with global warming driving the loss of about three-quarters of its volume so far. But the recent heat in the Arctic has shocked scientists, with temperatures 33C above average in parts of the Russian Arctic and 20C higher in some other places. In November, ice levels hit a record low, and we are now in “uncharted territory”, said Prof Jennifer Francis, an Arctic climate expert at Rutgers University in the US, who first became interested in the region when she sailed through it on a round-the-world trip in the 1980s. “These rapid changes in the Arctic are affecting weather patterns where you live right now,” she said. “In the past you have had natural variations like El Niño, but they have never happened before in combination with this very warm Arctic, so it is a whole new ball game. “It is inconceivable that this ridiculously warm Arctic would not have an impact on weather patterns in the middle latitudes further south, where so many people live. “It’s safe to say [the hot Arctic] is going to have a big impact, but it’s hard to say exactly how big right now. But we are going to have a lot of very interesting weather – we’re not going to get around that one.” The area covered by Arctic sea ice at least four years old has decreased from 718,000 sq miles in September 1984 to 42,000 sq miles in September 2016. Older ice tends to be less vulnerable to melting. The age of the ice is indicated by shades ranging from blue-gray for the youngest ice to white for the oldest. Credits: Nasa The chain of events that links the melting Arctic with weather to the south begins with rising global temperatures causing more sea ice to melt. Unlike on the Antarctic continent, melting ice here exposes dark ocean beneath, which absorbs more sunlight than ice and warms further. This feedback loop is why the Arctic is heating up much faster than the rest of the planet.
This in turn narrows the temperature difference between the Arctic and lower latitudes, which is crucial because it is the temperature gradient between them that drives the jet stream wind, which streaks around the pole at up to 250mph and about 8km above the surface. The jet stream forms a boundary between the cold north and the warmer south, but the lower temperature difference means the winds are now weaker. This means the jet stream meanders more, with big loops bringing warm air to the frozen north and cold air into warmer southern climes. Furthermore, researchers say, the changes mean the loops can remain stuck over regions for weeks, rather than being blown westwards as in the past. This “blocking” effect means extreme events can unfold.
“There have been recent studies showing very plausible physical mechanisms of how rapid warming in the Arctic can influence weather in the mid latitudes, both in summer and winter,” said Dim Coumou at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. Coumou is a former offshore industry geophysicist who has studied the link between extreme weather events and global warming since 2010. “A couple of years ago this was the main criticism on any such links, that the physics was not well understood,” he said. “But the big question [now] is, how important are these mechanisms?” The other main influence on the jet stream is sea surface temperature in the tropics, which waxes and wanes with El Niño, while solar cycles and even volcanic eruptions have smaller effects. The clearest connection so far between the melting Arctic and weather is for extreme winter conditions, such as the intense winters that hit parts of North America and northern Europe in 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2013-14, causing record snowfalls and billions of dollars of damage. In those years, the jet stream deviated deeply southwards over those regions, pulling down savagely cold air. Prof Adam Scaife, a climate modelling expert at the UK’s Met Office, said the evidence for a link to shrinking Arctic ice was now good: “The consensus points towards that being a real effect.” While downswings of the jet stream can bring freezing winters, the accompanying upswings have been linked to worsening the drought in California. “These northward jet stream swings are of course the reason California is having such a terrible drought,” said Francis. This effect was in fact predicted back in 2004, with those researchers now saying: “Reality is moving faster than we thought or hoped it would.”
But the winter extremes can also swing the other way and bring mild but torrential weather, as seen in the past two winters in the UK, leading to severe flooding, said Prof Edward Hanna, at the University of Sheffield in the UK.
150 years of global warming in a minute-long symphony Guardian He pointed to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a cyclic variation in air pressure that may be affected by the fast melting of Arctic ice. The variability of the NOA has doubled in the last century, he said: “Within the last decade, there have been wild swings in the NAO values in December.” The connection between the vanishing Arctic ice and extreme summer weather in the northern hemisphere is probable, according to scientists, but not yet as certain as the winter link. Blocking patterns caused by slow-moving meanders of the jet stream have been firmly linked to some devastating events, including the 2010 summer floods in Pakistan, which killed 2,000 people and affected 20 million, and also the searing heatwave in Russia in the same year, which killed 50,000 people and wiped out $15bn (£12bn) of crops. Villagers stand outside their homes during flash floods on the outskirts of Peshawar, Pakistan, April 2016
“We also see such summer events more often in recent years,” said Coumou. Blocking events have also been linked to summer deluges in the UK, leading to disastrous flooding in 2007 and 2012 which caused billions of pounds in damage.
The year 2012 was also an extreme year for Greenland, with record melting across its entire surface flushing water into the ocean and accelerating sea level rise. The hot loop of air that sat on Greenland that year may also be linked to one of the biggest weather disasters of recent years: Hurricane Sandy, which killed 233 people and cost $75bn in damages. Scientists suspect that the blocking event over Greenland, potentially linked to the record low Arctic ice that summer, prevented the hurricane veering north-east out into the Atlantic like most storms. Instead, blocked by the high pressure, Sandy swung left over the most populated area of the east coast of the US. Damage caused by Hurricane Sandy in Rodanthe, North Carolina, October 2012
Another consequence of the fast melting Arctic raises the possibility that there may be even worse extreme weather to come, according to a few scientists: titanic Atlantic superstorms and hurricanes barreling across Europe.
The melting of Greenland ice is pouring about 250bn tonnes a year of fresh water, which is less dense than salty sea water, into the ocean. As a result, the water mass sinks less and the current that drags warm water up the Atlantic is weakened – scientists have already found that the current is at its weakest for a millennium. This means a region of the north Atlantic is becoming relatively cool and this exaggerates the contrast with tropical waters to the south, which is the driver for storms. In the worst case scenario, said the renowned climate scientist Prof James Hansen, this “will drive superstorms, stronger than any in modern times – all hell will break loose in the north Atlantic and neighbouring lands”.
Hansen– who was one of the first scientists to alert the world to the dangers of climate change in 1988 and has been arrested more than once outside the White House while protesting against fossil fuel developments – pointed to the historical record as a precedent: 118,000 years ago a superstorm tossed 1,000-tonne mega boulders on to the shores of the Bahamas.
“I would certainly not call such [superstorm] scenarios ridiculous,” said Coumou. “But it is speculative – we don’t have the hard evidence.”
But even with what is known so far, there is cause for concern that the complex interactions are turning the slow burn of global temperature rise into sudden weather disasters.
“The worrying aspect is that such dynamical changes can occur more abruptly than simple background warming of the climate,” said Coumou. “Dynamical changes can change more rapidly and can therefore lead to surprises and I think there are many such possibilities in the system.” A polar bear swims in Svalbard. The fjords there would usually be partially covered with sea ice, but last winter most of the archipelago was surrounded by open water. 
Amid the gloomy prospects, there is some cause for hope however. “A large fraction of the US public still doesn’t believe that it is humans that are affecting the climate system,” said Francis. “But one of the silver linings of this pretty dark cloud is that the Arctic is such an obvious and conspicuous change, that anybody can see them happening. There is no ambiguity whatsoever.”
But this changing of minds needs to happen quickly, said Hansen: “If we wait for the natural world to reveal itself clearly, it may be too late.”",other

The study looked at over 32,000 individuals who had received either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines and monitored them for heart-related conditions between June 1, 2021, and July 31, 2021.  32 of the study subjects were admitted into the hospital with heart and chest-related symptoms.  “There were 15,997 doses of Moderna vaccine, and 16,382 doses of Pfizer vaccine administered over the study period, for a total of 32,379 doses. Note that these numbers represent a mixture of first and second doses. TRENDING: ""I Went There for You My Son"" - J6 Political Prisoner Chris Quaglin Was Brutally Beaten in Jail and Denied Celiac-Safe Food - Here Is His Heartfelt Letter to His Son on His First Birthday -- Please Donate Therefore, if our cohort captured all cases in the Ottawa area, then the incidence of myocarditis would be 0.1% of all vaccine doses (32 cases/32,379 doses x 100), or 10 cases of myocarditis for every 10,000 doses of vaccine.”  Researchers found that the symptoms show up extremely quickly after vaccination, usually after the patient’s second dose. On average, people who were affected developed the condition after just 1.5 days.  They also found that men are at a much greater risk than women – only 2 women experienced heart inflammation.  “32 patients were identified over the period of interest. Eighteen patients were diagnosed with myocarditis; 12 with myopericarditis; and 2 with pericarditis alone. The median age was 33 years (18-65 years). The sex ratio was 2 females to 29 males. In 5 cases, symptoms developed after only a single dose of mRNA vaccine. In 27 patients, symptoms developed after their second dose of. Median time between vaccine dose and symptoms was 1.5 days (1-26 days).”  People who took the Moderna jab were 3x more likely to develop symptoms than those who took the Pfizer shot.  To date, this has been the largest case study that has looked at the correlation between Covid mRNA vaccines and myocarditis symptoms within a month of vaccination.  If the results are true, it would actually be more of a risk for anyone under 65 to receive the shot than it would be to contract the virus and recover, especially depending on how young they are. Myocarditis and pericarditis both come with an extremely poor prognosis and end up killing over 50% within 3-10 years of their diagnosis.  According to the most recent data, Americans under 65 have about a 1 in 1863 (Population – 273,820,000 / Total Covid deaths – 146,991) or .00054 chance of dying from Covid-19 or .054%. If you lower the age to 50 and under, the chance that Covid is fatal drops precipitously to .00017 or 1 in 5841 or .o17%.  In other words, the chances that covid will kill you if you are under 50 are almost 6x lower than the chances you will develop a debilitating (and often fatal in the long run) heart condition.  Even more shocking – people under 40 who take the jab are almost 13.5 times more likely to develop some form of myocarditis or pericarditis than to be killed by Covid. Keep in mind the median age from this study was 33.  Meanwhile, Joe Biden and the tyrannical health regime double down on their goal to get “every American” vaccinated by cramming down a new dictatorial federal mandate with a third experimental ‘booster’ jab being prepared for a massive rollout.  The Covid-19 vaccine has been so ‘effective’ in ‘protecting’ people that the masses will now be pressured into taking another dose as new outbreaks of the virus have forced a new wave of authoritarian restrictions.  Every single American has known for months where to go and how to get a vaccine if they wanted one. In fact, over 181 million eligible citizens have been fully vaccinated in the US – If the virus was as deadly as they are making it out to be, they wouldn’t have to mandate people to take the vaccine; and on the other end, if the vaccines provided the protection they’re supposed to provide, the vaccinated wouldn’t be calling people killers because they are refusing to ‘protect others.’  Besides, according to available data, a third of the entire US population had contracted Covid BY THE END OF 2020. Natural immunity has always proven to be superior to vaccines.  A recent study that was conducted in Israel on 800,000 individuals confirms that is especially the case with the rushed mRNA Covid vaccines.  They found that individuals who had received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were 13x more likely to contract Covid-19 than those who had natural immunity – Fully vaccinated people were also found to be at a “GREATER RISK OF HOSPITALIZATION.”  If 1/3rd of Americans had already contracted the virus – before it had even been known for a full year – then why would “everyone” be forced to take the experimental vaccine?

248,"When it comes to actions taken to address the Covid-19 threat, hindsight is still very much underway. For your consideration: a story and outcome you probably aren't hearing much about anywhere else. It takes place in the heart of Amish country.  Lancaster County, Pennsylvania: thousands of families lead lives largely separate from modern America.  The Amish are a Christian group that emphasizes the virtuous over the superficial. They don’t usually drive, use electricity, or have TVs. And during the Covid-19 outbreak, they became subjects in a massive social and medical experiment.  Sharyl: So, it's safe to say there was a whole different approach here in this community when coronavirus broke out than many other places?  Calvin Lapp: Absolutely.  Calvin Lapp is Amish Mennonite.  Lapp: There’s three things the Amish don't like. And that's government— they won't get involved in the government, they don't like the public education system— they won't send their children to education, and they also don't like the health system. They rip us off. Those are three things that we feel like we're fighting against all the time. Well, those three things are all part of what Covid is.  After a short shutdown last year, the Amish chose a unique path that led to Covid-19 tearing through at warp speed. It began with an important religious holiday in May.  Lapp: When they take communion, they dump their wine into a cup and they take turns to drink out of that cup. So, you go the whole way down the line, and everybody drinks out of that cup, if one person has coronavirus, the rest of church is going to get coronavirus. The first time they went back to church, everybody got coronavirus.  Lapp says they weren’t denying coronavirus, they were facing it head on.  Lapp: It’s a worse thing to quit working than dying. Working is more important than dying. But to shut down and say that we can't go to church, we can't get together with family, we can't see our old people in the hospital, we got to quit working? It's going completely against everything that we believe. You're changing our culture completely to try to act like they wanted us to act the last year, and we're not going to do it.  Steve Nolt is a scholar on Amish and Mennonite culture, and Mennonite himself. He’s studying Amish news publications to analyze community-wide trends.  Sharyl: So, are you saying, as of about May of 2020, things kind of went back to normal in the Amish community?  Steve Nolt: For the most part, yeah, by the middle of May, it's sort of like back to a typical behavior again.  That also meant avoiding hospitals.  Nolt: I know of some cases in which Amish people refused to go to the hospital, even when they were very sick because if they went there, they wouldn't be able to have visitors. And it was more important to be sick, even very sick at home and have the ability to have some people around you than to go to the hospital and be isolated.  Then, last March, remarkable news. The Lancaster County Amish were reported to be the first community to achieve “herd immunity,” meaning a large part of a population had been infected with Covid-19 and became immune.  Some outsiders are skeptical, and solid proof is hard to come by.  Nolt: Even those who believed that they had Covid tended not to get tested. Their approach tended to be, “I'm sick. I know I'm sick. I don't have to have someone else telling me I'm sick.” Or a concern that if they got a positive test, they would then be asked to really dramatically limit what they were doing in a way that might be uncomfortable for them. So, we don't have that testing number.  Lapp: We didn't want the numbers to go up, because then they would shut things more. What's the advantage of getting a test?  One thing’s clear: there's no evidence of any more deaths among the Amish than in places that shut down tight— some claim there were fewer here. That’s without masking, staying at home, or another important measure.  Sharyl: Did most of the community, at least the adults, get the Covid-19 vaccine?  Nolt: Again, we don't have data on that, but I think it's pretty clear that in percentage terms, relatively few did.  Lapp: Oh, we're glad all the English people got their Covid vaccines. That's great. Because now we don't have to wear a mask, we can do what we want. So good for you. Thank you. We appreciate it. Us? No, we're not getting vaccines. Of course not. We all got the Covid, so why would you get a vaccine?  By staying open, the Amish here have one tangible 2020 accomplishment few others can claim.  Lapp: We have this joke: when everybody else started walking, we started running. We made more money in the last year than we ever did. It was our best year ever.  Did the Amish really find a magic formula? They say yes. And they don’t care who doubts it.  Lapp: Yeah, all the Amish know we got herd immunity. Of course we got herd immunity! The whole church gets coronavirus. We know we got coronavirus. We think we’re smarter than everybody. We shouldn’t be bragging, but we think we did the right thing.  Sharyl (on-camera): Nolt, the scholar, is publishing a paper on the Amish social response to government mandates and Covid-19.",other
249,"According to a new study of tech companies that made pledges to support the black lives matter movement, those companies actually employed fewer black employees on average than companies that didn’t take any public stance. That comes despite the supporting companies making a combined $4.6 billion in financial commitments to the cause.  As Bloomberg reports:  A new study of diversity in the technology industry found companies that made statements of solidarity had 20% fewer Black employees on average than those that didn’t. The finding highlights a gap between what companies say about social issues and what they do in their own workplaces, said Stephanie Lampkin, the founder and chief executive officer of Blendoor, which conducted the study.  Obviously no company should be hiring specifically because one belongs to a particular demographic over skill, but it is amusing an amusing juxtaposition nonetheless.  Corporations pretending to take political stances for the purpose of promoting a public image of themselves is nothing new. We saw this when companies like Apple, Nike, and Coca-Cola all came out with their “principled stands against injustice” in opposing common sense voter integrity laws in George – as they were lobbying against a bill that would bar U.S. companies from relying on forced Uighur labor in China.  This is nothing new either. Decades ago, in response to businesses capitalizing off of climate change hysteria there was even a term coined to describe the practice of companies deceptively marketing themselves as “green” and “environmentally friendly” solely to boost business: greenwashing.  Woke capitalism is on the rise, and it won’t go away until everyone wakes up to the blatantly obvious fact that it’s just a marketing campaign.

250,"Listen 0:00 BOSPUB-1.mp3  Earlier this month, 47 democrats in the house of representatives defied a house veto threat by backing a GOP bill to ramp up screening requirements for Syrian and Iraqi refugees. Congressman Stephen Lynch was among them. He joined Jim Braude and Margery Eagan on Boston Public Radio to discuss the reasoning behind his vote and other congressional matters.  Questions are paraphrased, and responses are edited where noted [...].  MARGERY: Let’s start with the vote on the Syrian refugees. Why were you with those 47 other democrats?  It’s a very simple bill, I know that it’s got subsumed within a larger discussion about immigration policy, but basically, the bill we voted on was a very short bill—four pages in length, basically, and it said that the director of national security shall review the vetting process as being conducted by both the FBI and the department of homeland security. Because of the disastrous results we’ve had so far with the screening process, especially the department of homeland security, I think it was a very good idea to have another set of eyeballs looking at that process.  Back in August, we did an investigation—the inspector General did—of the Department of Homeland Security, and they had 72 individuals that were on the terrorist watch list that were actually working at the Department of Homeland Security. The director had to resign because of that. Then we went further and did and eight-airport investigation. We had staffers go into eight different airports to test the department of homeland security screening process at major airports. They had a 95 percent failure rate. We had folks—this was a testing exercise, so we had folks going in there with guns on their ankles, and other weapons on their persons, and there was a 95 percent failure rate.  I have very low confidence based on empirical data that we’ve got on the Department of Homeland Security. I think we desperately need another set of eyeballs looking at the vetting process. That’s vetting that’s being done at major airports where we have a stationary person coming through a facility, and we’re failing 95 percent of the time. I have even lower confidence that they can conduct the vetting process in places like Jordan, or Belize or on the Syrian border, or in Cairo, or Beirut in any better fashion, especially given the huge volume of applicants we’ve had seeking refugee status.  JIM: Even if you’re right that the system needs strengthening, the most likely way that a terrorist would come into this country is not through an 18-24 month-long process, but through this Visa program that allows 20 million people from 38 countries to come here every single year with absolutely no prior approval at all.  We had Democratic and Republican proposals on this bill, and there wasn’t a dime’s worth of difference between the two of them. It became a sort of a proxy battle over immigration. You had a bunch of Republican governors who were using it politically, and saying, “we’re going to stop refugees from coming into our state, which is baloney because they have no ability—zero ability—under the constitution to actually prevent refugees from coming into their state. You also had other people on the far left saying that this would stop every person from coming into the United States. In both cases, if they only took the time to read the bill, they would see that it did not do either. The democratic proposal also requires a multi-layered vetting process of refugees.  The reason the refugee issue came up and not the Visa waiver program is because in the Paris example, you had somebody go into the stream of legitimate refugees and then perpetrate acts of violence upon the civilians in Paris. That’s why that example came to the forefront.  I agree with you—I think the Visa waiver program, where you’ve got 20 million people coming in, versus the [refugees] coming in, 10,000? perhaps? At the end of the day, obviously the Visa waiver program is the one that we should be looking at.  JIM: Governor Charlie Baker was one of those governors who hesitated about refugees coming to Massachusetts—he didn’t sign the letter that Republican governors sent to the president, but he did state that he wanted a pause on the whole refugee thing. Was he grandstanding in your opinion?  I don’t think he was. If you listen to his press conference, when he addressed it, I thought his remarks were very thoughtful, and I thought his remarks were very measured, compared to what you heard from some of the red state governors that were doing a lot of the chest bumping and that sort of thing. Governor Baker was asking for more information, which I think was totally appropriate.  MARGERY: You just mentioned the TSA’s terrible record. You mentioned having low confidence in the Department of Homeland Security… is it every man for himself every time you get in an airplane?  I think that they… The resources are being spent, I think there are a bunch of different weaknesses in our system, I think we have very low-paid TSA and DHS workers, I think there’s a huge turnover there, when you talk to the people at the airport who are actually working there. When Bush created this system, I think it was 700,000 employees, he basically stripped away their right to join a union. They’re trying to use low-wage employees there, I heard from a TSA employee last week who was leaving, and he said there’s just no room for advancement there, they’re just stuck. I think morale is part of it, and the whole screening process is being revisited now after the inspector general’s report.  MARGERY: If Homeland Security is so inept, but we depend on them, should we be much more scared than we are? Should the focus be to better train DHS employees?  Absolutely...we had a hearing three weeks ago where the new TSA director said that they’re going back to the drawing board, and beginning again in terms of what their approach is. That’s a good thing. It’s a little bit late in coming, but I think because of what happened in Paris and what happened in Egypt with the airliner, what happened in Beirut… We’re redoubling our efforts, but obviously the system that was initially put in place was inadequate.

252,"In an attempt to reduce violent crime, San Francisco, California, will launch a program that will pay people $300 a month if they don’t shoot someone.  Fox News reported that the program, called Dream Keeper Fellowship, “will pay 10 individuals who are at high risk of being on either end of a shooting $300 each month to not be involved in such crimes.” This means that people at high risk of being shot also qualify for the program, though it’s unclear how the determination is made. The program will launch in October.  Sheryl Davis, executive director of the Human Rights Commission, told Newsweek that the program is not “transactional,” as it may seem.  “It’s not necessarily as cut and dry as folks may think. It’s not as transactional as, ‘Here’s a few dollars so that you don’t do something bad,’ but it really is about how you help us improve public safety in the neighborhood,” she told the outlet.  From Newsweek:  Participants will be paired with life coaches from the city’s Street Violence Intervention Program and will be considered “community ambassadors” who work to prevent violence. They will work on their professional, personal, and community development and will be thought of as “partners” in engaging community members and decreasing violence.  Davis said the program will attempt to find the “root causes” of violence, which she said in “so many ways are economic.”  This sentiment was echoed by San Francisco Mayor London Breed.  “In many cases, sadly, the common denominator is that these folks do not have any sort of income. And so part of what we’re trying to do is make sure that money is not a barrier to turning your life around,” Breed said, according to The Telegraph.  Participants in the program can earn even more money by getting a job, going to school, or even mediating situations that may lead to violence. In other words, the program will pay people to do things they should be doing anyway. What happens if and when that money stops? Will the people continue to work or follow the law? Will they need to be paid this way forever?  Newsweek reported that the program in San Francisco is based on a similar one in Richmond, California, which the American Journal of Public Health said helped reduce gun homicide by 55%. That claim is so odd that even left-wing Mother Jones questioned whether paying people not to shoot others actually reduced crime or whether the city just got lucky.  The Washington Examiner’s David Freddoso noted that a similar program was also tried in Sacramento, “where its promoters boast that ‘only’ 44% of participants were subsequently arrested on new charges — well, as long as you don’t count about one-third of the participants who dropped out or were arrested in its first six months.”  Activist and Reverend Eugene Rivers, another critic of the program, told Fox News that the program was a “gimmick.”  “You do not get young people to turn from crime by generating gimmicks. This is a policy gimmick,” he said. “It’s a bad idea, it’s not a new idea and for many people it’ll be Christmas in September or October.”  The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

Responding to GOP criticisms of the Biden administration's planned ""door-to-door"" campaign to encourage unvaccinated Americans to inoculate themselves, Becerra told CNN the government has had to ""spend trillions of dollars to try to keep Americans alive during this pandemic.""  ""So it is absolutely the government's business, it is taxpayers' business, if we have to continue to spend money to try to keep people from contracting COVID and helping reopen the economy,"" he said.  FAUCI'S ‘GET OVER THIS POLITICAL STATEMENT’ COMMENT ON VACCINES GETS PANNED  Becerra said people didn't have to answer the door but he hoped they would so officials could dispel rumors about the vaccine, which has proven to be highly effective in driving down cases, hospitalizations and deaths. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 56% of the adult population has been ""fully vaccinated"" and 67% has gotten at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine.  States that tend to vote Republican have reported lower vaccination rates, and polls show Republican voters are far more likely than Democrats to say they will not or likely will not get the vaccine. The issue has become part of a larger debate over public health measures colliding with Americans' personal freedoms.  Citing concerns over the ""Delta variant"" of the virus, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said this week the door-to-door push is designed to inform people in less vaccinated pockets of the country about where to get the shot and address their concerns about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, she said, adding that it's not up to the federal government to mandate vaccines.  WHITE HOUSE DEFENDS DOOR-TO-DOOR VACCINATION PUSH AMID BACKLASH  Asked by anchor Brianna Keilar if the administration was considering more aggressive measures to get more people vaccinated, Becerra hedged, saying he wanted people to have ""as much freedom and choice as possible.""

258,"Dr. Vladimir Zelenko became a hero for his early use of hydroxychloroquine to fight COVID. Sadly, his efforts were halted by a Democrat governor. But Dr. Zelenko didn’t stop. He kept working — and found an over-the-counter way to help people. TRENDING: ""For the First Time We Were All Able to Sing the Star-Spangled Banner Together, We Sang it Loud and Proud"" - Exclusive: Patriots Speak Out from the Inside of DC ""GITMO"" - One Year After January 6 Watch: Here is Dr. Zelenko talk about “the bullet and gun” approach for understanding zinc ionophores (transcript of highlights is below): Dr Zelenko: The Gun & The Bullet, Breaking Down The Protocol And Immune Support Here is a transcript of highlights from the video: Dr. Zelenko: “Zinc is the bullet – it kills the virus. The only problem is the bullet doesn’t get to the place where it needs to be. The virus is inside the cell. The enzyme is inside the cell. And the zinc on its own cannot get into the cell. You have a bullet without a gun – useless. Now, it turns out there’s a class of medications called ‘zinc ionophores’ or a class of substances called ‘zinc ionophores’ — what they do — is they open up a channel, a door, which allows zinc to go from outside the cell to inside the cell. There are four of them that are readily available – two of them are prescription and two of them are over-the-counter. The two prescription ones everyone has heard of: Hydroxycholorquine and Ivermection. They’re the guns that shoot the bullet. The bullet then gets into the cell and stops the virus enzyme from helping the virus replicate. So you have a gun and bullet. Only the synergy of the two creates a functioning unit. S in april of last year, Cuomo issued an executive order that was directly targeting me and my patients – because I was the only one in the state doing it. Where pharmacies would not dispense hydroxychloroquine to patients. So all of a sudden, I had a gun and a bullet approach, but…he took away the zinc delivery system — at least he took away access to my patients. So I was forced by necessity to innovate. I did more research, and on the NIH servers of all places, I found papers saying a substance called quercetin is a zinc delivery system, as well. It’s a zinc ionophore. To be honest, I’d never heard of quercetin. So I googled it and I see it’s over-the-counter. That was one of the most significant realizations in my life and probably in humanity. Why do I say that? Because now there was a cure for tyranny. There are two risk factors for dying from COVID: It’s the doctor you choose and the government you live under. Besides that, there’s no reason a person should die from COVID. Now, you don’t need a doctor and now you don’t need permission from the government. You can go to a pharmacy or go to a supermarket and buy an over-the-counter option of quercetin together with Zinc and Vitamin C and Vitamin D. Together it creates a very powerful immune-boosting nutritional supplement. According to the FDA, I’m not allowed to make any claims except that it’s an immune booster and nutritional supplement. So what I’m going to say is the following: Quercetin and Vitamin C together form a functioning zinc ionophore — a zinc delivery system. Zinc is what it delivers, so you actually need zinc as well. You need the gun and the bullet. And Vitamin D – the studies all show – Vitamin D3 levels between 50 and 70 virtually eliminate hospitalizations or admissions in the intensive care unit. It optimizes their immune system..so you need Vitamin D, then you need Zinc, which is the bullet. And then to form a functioning gun, you need Vitamin C and quercetin… Patients were having trouble sourcing it, because it was four different ingredients that weren’t always available in the same place. They had trouble finding the right doses. It was a puzzle that was a little too complex for people to put together. So I was asked as a necessity — as a favor to people — to produce something that has everything in one package. It made sense to me, so with the help of my colleagues, we were able to produce a substance — a compound called Z-Stack — that has Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and most importantly has quercetin and zinc.” Now, Dr. Zelenko is now making Z-Stack available to everyone.

261,"A new study from Johns Hopkins on natural immunity to COVID-19 might prove Anthony Fauci's worst nightmare. ""If you had a positive COVID test in the past, then you had a 99.3 percent chance of having circulating antibodies against COVID, and those antibodies were present up to 20 months, nearly two years after the infection,"" explained Dr. Marty Makary on ""Washington Watch."" The antibodies could last longer, but ""that's as long as the infection has been around."" For millions of Americans who have recovered from COVID-19, this is good news. But there couldn't be worse news for Dr. Fauci, or as some believe him to be, Science Incarnate. Since early in the pandemic, the National Institutes of Health have discounted natural immunity because, they said, its duration was unknown. That's the public health equivalent of recommending soldiers not carry guns into combat because they might jam unpredictably. Over a year later, the federally-backed funding behemoth still has never bothered to study the question. ""Why am I doing this study,"" asked Makary, a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine & School of Public Health, ""when the NIH has $42 billion and could have done this study instantly?"" He suggested the answer is, ""they don't want to know the results."" The conclusions of the Johns Hopkins study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, are far from ""fringe."" Israeli data have shown natural immunity to be 27 times more protective than vaccines, but Mr. Science ignored that data, preferring instead to extrapolate a policy decision from other Israeli data, released around the same time, which showed booster shots could reduce the risk of hospitalization for older people. ""You cannot cherry pick the science,"" Makary protested. Makary is concerned with the exclusive club of medical experts who are both advising the Biden administration on policy and controlling the purse strings for scientific grants to allow others to conduct research. ""They just talk among themselves,"" he said. A FOIA request has revealed that in October 2020, Fauci colluded with NIH Director Francis Collins to discredit with ""a quick and devastating published take down"" Stanford epidemiologist Jay Bhattacharya and other authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, who advocated for natural immunity and targeted protection for vulnerable groups. Fauci's ilk ""are living in their own bubble,"" Makary said. ""They're not even thinking about an exit of the pandemic."" To determine U.S. policy on natural immunity, they held a ""small vote among some of their experts... The vote was split, and they decided not to recognize it."" Note that this split vote was the ""scientific consensus"" with which dissenting opinions were so ruthlessly de-platformed, ridiculed, and cancelled in the early months of lockdowns. The self-proclaimed experts knew that Americans wouldn't tolerate lockdowns if their flimsy scientific basis was widely known. ""This should not be an oligarchy,"" argued Makary. ""This should be an open scientific debate."" ""The science is now heavily curated,"" continued Makary. ""The CDC's own study on natural immunity... showed natural immunity was three times more protective [against hospitalization] than vaccinated immunity."" But that's not what their conclusion said. They wrote that ""vaccination is still the safest strategy. But that's not what the data show,"" he said.

262,"In July 2021, the Indonesian Food and Drug Monitoring Agency (BPOM) finally granted the Emergency Use Authorization for Ivermectin as the therapeutic drug to cure the Covid-19. This was due to the country’s “worst-case scenario” epidemic at the time according to officials. Indonesia experienced a spike in COVID-19 infection and deaths in July and was struggling to slow the virus transmission due to its high population.  Indonesia is ranked as the world’s fourth most populous country. The Indonesian government on Thursday (July 15) began distributing free medicine and vitamins to self-isolating Covid-19 patients in high-risk areas as the highly transmissible Delta variant of the coronavirus continued to rip through the country, emptying pharmacy shelves. Each package will have seven days worth of therapeutic Covid-19 drugs and vitamins, and will be given to asymptomatic patients as well as those with mild to moderate symptoms including fever and dry cough. The medication for the latter group will require consultation with a doctor and a prescription. Medical facilities are stretched thin, and demand for oxygen and medication has also soared. As scores of people are isolating themselves at home and self-medicating, prices of drugs have shot up in pharmacies and online. The health ministry has since moved to cap the prices of drugs such as favipiravir, remdesivir and ivermectin. Indonesia’s food and drug agency has authorised ivermectin for emergency use against Covid-19, Reuters reported, although the World Health Organisation, as well as European and the US regulators did not recommend its use for Covid-19 patients. After the government authorized the use of Ivermectin for COVID-19 patients, the number of cases significantly plummeted since July. As of October 8, only 20.5% were fully vaccinated and 35.9% got their first dose. One Twitter user posted a comparison between India and Indonesia’s success with Ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19. The Gateway Pundit previously reported the same scenario in Uttar Pradesh, India. The 33 districts in Uttar Pradesh, India have now become free from COVID-19. The recovery rate has increased up to 98.7% proving the effectiveness of IVERMECTIN as part of the “Uttar Pradesh Covid Control Model.” Of course, the media won’t mention that Ivermectin is being used for the treatment of COVID-19.Uttar Pradesh is the leading state in India to use Ivermectin as early and preventatively in all family contacts.

A groundbreaking preprint paper by the prestigious Oxford University Clinical Research Group, published Aug. 10 in The Lancet, includes alarming findings devastating to the COVID vaccine rollout. The study found vaccinated individuals carry 251 times the load of COVID-19 viruses in their nostrils compared to the unvaccinated. While moderating the symptoms of infection, the jab allows vaccinated individuals to carry unusually high viral loads without becoming ill at first, potentially transforming them into presymptomatic superspreaders. This phenomenon may be the source of the shocking post-vaccination surges in heavily vaccinated populations globally. The paper’s authors, Chau et al, demonstrated widespread vaccine failure and transmission under tightly controlled circumstances in a hospital lockdown in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam. ORDER TODAY: Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s New Book — 'The Real Anthony Fauci' The scientists studied healthcare workers who were unable to leave the hospital for two weeks. The data showed that fully vaccinated workers — about two months after injection with the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (AZD1222) — acquired, carried and presumably transmitted the Delta variant to their vaccinated colleagues. They almost certainly also passed the Delta infection to susceptible unvaccinated people, including their patients. Sequencing of strains confirmed the workers transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to one another. This is consistent with the observations in the U.S. from Farinholt and colleagues, and congruent with comments by the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conceding COVID-19 vaccines have failed to stop transmission of SARS-CoV-2. On Feb. 11, the World Health Organization indicated the AZD1222 vaccine efficacy of 63.09% against the development of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. The conclusions of the Chau paper support the warnings by leading medical experts that the partial, non-sterilizing immunity from the three notoriously “leaky” COVID-19 vaccines allow carriage of 251 times the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to samples from the pre-vaccination era in 2020. Thus, we have a key piece to the puzzle explaining why the Delta outbreak is so formidable — fully vaccinated are participating as COVID-19 patients and acting as powerful Typhoid Mary-style super-spreaders of the infection. Vaccinated individuals are blasting out concentrated viral explosions into their communities and fueling new COVID surges. Vaccinated healthcare workers are almost certainly infecting their coworkers and patients, causing horrendous collateral damage. Continued vaccination will only make this problem worse, particularly among frontline doctors and nurses workers who are caring for vulnerable patients. Health systems should drop vaccine mandates immediately, take stock of COVID-19 recovered workers who are robustly immune to Delta and consider the ramifications of their current vaccinated healthcare workers as potential threats to high risk patients and coworkers.",other
264,"Scientists from the Cleveland Clinic, USA, have recently evaluated the effectiveness of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19) vaccination among individuals with or without a history of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The study findings reveal that individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection do not get additional benefits from vaccination, indicating that COVID-19 vaccines should be prioritized to individuals without prior infection. The study is currently available on the medRxiv* preprint server.Background In the United States, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided emergency use authorization for two mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, which have shown high efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease in clinical trials. However, the ability to vaccinate a large part of the global population is limited by vaccine supply. In order to ensure fair access to vaccines throughout the world, the COVID-19 vaccines Global Access (COVAX) initiative was launched. In many countries, especially those with low socioeconomic status, there is a serious shortage of vaccines. Thus, in order to get the maximum vaccine benefits, the most vulnerable population should be prioritized for the vaccination. Currently, most countries prioritize vaccination for healthcare and other frontline workers, elderly people, and people with comorbidities. To further narrow down the prioritization criteria, the scientists in the current study have evaluated the necessity of COVID-19 vaccines for individuals who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Study design The study was conducted on 52,238 employees in the Cleveland Clinic. A positive RT-PCR test was considered to define SARS-CoV-2 infection. The participants received two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at an interval of 28 days. A participant was considered vaccinated after 14 days of receiving the 2nd vaccine dose. Similarly, a participant who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days before the vaccination initiation was considered previously infected. Important observations Of all enrolled participants, 5% had previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared to 59% of non-infected participants, only 47% of previously infected participants were vaccinated by the end of the study. About 63% of all vaccinated participants received the Moderna vaccine. The analysis of cumulative COVID-19 incidence revealed that during the course of the study, SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred almost exclusively in participants who were not previously infected and were not vaccinated. Interestingly, no significant difference in COVID-19 incidence was observed between previously infected and currently unvaccinated participants, previously infected and currently vaccinated participants, and previously uninfected and currently vaccinated participants. The participants from these three groups exhibited a significantly lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to previously uninfected and currently unvaccinated participants. Specifically, of all infections during the study period, 99.3% occurred in participants who were not infected previously and remained unvaccinated. In contrast, only 0.7% of infections occurred in participants who were not previously infected but were currently vaccinated. Importantly, not a single incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed in previously infected participants with or without vaccination.With further statistical analysis, it was observed that the COVID-19 vaccination significantly reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in previously uninfected participants but not in previously infected participants. Although the study did not directly estimate the duration of protection from natural infection, it was observed that previously infected participants remained protected against COVID-19 for at least 10 months after the symptom onset or a positive test result. Study significance The study findings reveal that individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 are less likely to get additional benefits from vaccination. In contrast, individuals without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection can get the maximum benefits from vaccination. Thus, based on the study findings, COVID-19 vaccines should be prioritized to naïve individuals without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",other
265,"The Italian Higher Institute of Health has drastically reduced the country’s official COVID death toll number by over 97 per cent after changing the definition of a fatality to someone who died from COVID rather than with COVID. Italian newspaper Il Tempo reports that the Institute has revised downward the number of people who have died from COVID rather than with COVID from 130,000 to under 4,000. “Yes, you read that right. Turns out 97.1% of deaths hitherto attributed to Covid were not due directly to Covid,” writes Toby Young. Of the of the 130,468 deaths registered as official COVID deaths since the start of the pandemic, only 3,783 are directly attributable to the virus alone. “All the other Italians who lost their lives had from between one and five pre-existing diseases. Of those aged over 67 who died, 7% had more than three co-morbidities, and 18% at least two,” writes Young. “According to the Institute, 65.8% of Italians who died after being infected with Covid were ill with arterial hypertension (high blood pressure), 23.5% had dementia, 29.3% had diabetes, and 24.8% atrial fibrillation. Add to that, 17.4% had lung problems, 16.3% had had cancer in the last five years and 15.7% suffered from previous heart failures.” The Institute’s new definition of a COVID death means that COVID has killed fewer people in Italy than (whisper it) the average bout of seasonal flu. If a similar change were made by other national governments, the official COVID death toll would be cut by a margin of greater than 90 per cent. Don’t expect many others to follow suit though, given that governments have invested so much of their authority in hyping the the threat posed by the virus. For example, behavioral psychologists in the UK worked with the state to deliberately “exaggerate” the threat of COVID via “unethical” and “totalitarian” methods of propaganda in order to terrify the public into mass compliance. And it worked. A survey conducted after the first lockdown found that the average Brit thought 100 times more people had died from COVID than the official death toll. Now we come to understand that the official killed ‘by COVID’ and not ‘with COVID’ figure is less than one tenth what is officially reported as the total COVID death toll. Despite the change, Italy may yet take the decision to make the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory, although how such a scheme would be imposed remains unspecified.",other
266,"A funny thing happened this afternoon. Not funny as in “haha”. More like funny as in, “ohhhhh that’s how the FDA rigs the process.” I was reading the CDC’s “Guidance for Health Economics Studies Presented to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), 2019 Update” and I realized that the FDA’s woeful risk-benefit analysis in connection with Pfizer’s EUA application to jab children ages 5 to 11 violates many of the principles of the CDC’s Guidance document. The CDC “Guidance” document describes 21 things that every health economics study in connection with vaccines must do and the FDA risk-benefit analysis violated at least half of them. Today I want to focus on a single factor: the Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNTV). In four separate places the CDC Guidance document mentions the importance of coming up with a Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNTV). I did not recall seeing an NNTV in the FDA risk-benefit document. So I checked the FDA’s risk-benefit analysis again and sure enough, there was no mention of an NNTV. Because the FDA failed to provide an NNTV, I will attempt to provide it here. First a little background. The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) in order to prevent a single case, hospitalization, ICU admission, or death, is a standard way to measure the effectiveness of any drug. It’s an important tool because it enables policymakers to evaluate tradeoffs between a new drug, a different existing drug, or doing nothing. In vaccine research the equivalent term is Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNTV, sometimes also written as NNV) in order to prevent a single case, hospitalization, ICU admission, or death (those are 4 different NNTVs that one could calculate). Pharma HATES talking about NNTV and they hate talking about NNTV even more when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines because the NNTV is so ridiculously high that this vaccine could not pass any honest risk-benefit analysis. Indeed about a year ago I innocently asked on Twitter what the NNTV is for coronavirus vaccines. Pharma sent a swarm of trolls in to attack me and Pharma goons published hits pieces on me outside of Twitter to punish me for even asking the question. Of course none of the Pharma trolls provided an estimate of the NNTV for COVID-19 shots. That tells us that we are exactly over the target. Various health economists have calculated a NNTV for COVID-19 vaccines. Ronald Brown, a health economist in Canada, estimated that the NNTV to prevent a single case of coronavirus is from 88 to 142. Others have calculated the NNTV to prevent a single case at 256. German and Dutch researchers, using a large (500k) data set from a field study in Israel calculated an NNTV between 200 and 700 to prevent one case of COVID-19 for the mRNA shot marketed by Pfizer. They went further and figured out that the “NNTV to prevent one death is between 9,000 and 100,000 (95% confidence interval), with 16,000 as a point estimate.” You can see why Pharma hates this number so much (I can picture Pharma’s various PR firms sending out an “All hands on deck!” message right now to tell their trolls to attack this article). One would have to inject a lot of people to see any benefit and the more people who are injected the more the potential benefits are offset by the considerable side-effects from the shots. Furthermore, the NNTV to prevent a single case is not a very meaningful measure because most people, particularly children, recover on their own (or even more quickly with ivermectin if treated early). The numbers that health policy makers should really want to know are the NNTV to prevent a single hospitalization, ICU admission, or death. But with the NNTV to prevent a single case already so high, and with significant adverse events from coronavirus vaccines averaging about 15% nationwide, Pharma and the FDA dare not calculate an NNTV for hospitalizations, ICU, and deaths, because then no one would ever take this product (bye bye $93 billion in annual revenue). Increased all cause mortality in the Pfizer clinical trial of adults As Bobby Kennedy explains, Pfizer’s clinical trial in adults showed alarming increases in all cause mortality in the vaccinated: In Pfizer’s 6 month clinical trial in adults — there was 1 covid death out of 22,000 in the vaccine (“treatment”) group and 2 Covid deaths out of 22,000 in the placebo group (see Table s4). So NNTV = 22,000. The catch is there were 5 heart attack deaths in the vaccine group and only 1 in placebo group. So for every 1 life saved from Covid, the Pfizer vaccine kills 4 from heart attacks. All cause mortality in the 6 month study was 20 in vaccine group and 14 in placebo group. So a 42% all cause mortality increase among the vaccinated. The vaccine loses practically all efficacy after 6 months so they had to curtail the study. They unblinded and offered the vaccine to the placebo group. At that point the rising harm line had long ago intersected the sinking efficacy line. Former NY Times investigative reporter Alex Berenson also wrote about the bad outcomes for the vaccinated in the Pfizer clinical trial in adults (here). Berenson received a lifetime ban from Twitter for posting Pfizer’s own clinical trial data. Pfizer learned their lesson with the adult trial and so when they conducted a trial of their mRNA vaccine in children ages 5 to 11 they intentionally made it too small (only 2,300 participants) and too short (only followed up for 2 months) in order to hide harms. Estimating an NNTV in children ages 5 to 11 using Pfizer’s own clinical trial data All of the NNTV estimates above are based on data from adults. In kids the NNTV will be even higher (the lower the risk, the higher the NNTV to prevent a single bad outcome). Children ages 5 to 11 are at extremely low risk of death from coronavirus. In a meta-analysis combining data from 5 studies, Stanford researchers Cathrine Axfors and John Ioannidis found a median infection fatality rate (IFR) of 0.0027% in children ages 0-19. In children ages 5 to 11 the IFR is even lower. Depending on the study one looks at, COVID-19 is slightly less dangerous or roughly equivalent to the flu in children. So how many children would need to be injected with Pharma’s mRNA shot in order to prevent a single hospitalization, ICU admission, or death? Let’s examine Pfizer’s EUA application and the FDA’s risk-benefit analysis. By Pfizer’s own admission, there were zero hospitalization, ICU admissions, or deaths, in the treatment or control group in their study of 2,300 children ages 5 to 11. So the Number Needed to Vaccinate in order to prevent a single hospitalization, ICU admission, or death, according to Pfizer’s own data, is infinity. ∞. Not the good kind of infinity as in God or love or time or the universe. This is the bad kind of infinity as in you could vaccinate every child age 5 to 11 in the U.S. and not prevent a single hospitalization, ICU admission, or death from coronavirus according to Pfizer’s own clinical trial data as submitted to the FDA. Of course Pfizer likes this kind of infinity because it means infinite profits. [Technically speaking the result is “undefined” because mathematically one cannot divide by zero, but you get my point.] Estimating an NNTV and risk-benefit model in children ages 5 to 11 using the limited data that are available Everyone knows that Pfizer was not even trying to conduct a responsible clinical trial of their mRNA shot in kids ages 5 to 11. Pfizer could have submitted to the FDA a paper napkin with the words “Iz Gud!” written in crayon and the VRBPAC would have approved the shot. They are all in the cartel together and they are all looking forward to their massive payoff/payday. But let’s not be like Pharma. Instead, let’s attempt to come up with a best guess estimate based on real world data. Over time, others will develop a much more sophisticated estimate (for example, Walach, Klement, & Aukema, 2021 estimated an NNTV for 3 different populations based on “days post dose”). But for our purposes here I think there is a much easier way to come up with a ballpark NNTV estimate for children ages 5 to 11. Here’s the benefits model: As of October 30, 2021, the CDC stated that 170 children ages 5 to 11 have died of COVID-19-related illness since the start of the pandemic. (That represents less than 0.1% of all coronavirus-related deaths nationwide even though children that age make up 8.7% of the U.S. population). The Pfizer mRNA shot only “works” for about 6 months (it increases risk in the first month, provides moderate protection in months 2 through 4 and then effectiveness begins to wane, which is why all of the FDA modeling only used a 6 month time-frame). So any modeling would have to be based on vaccine effectiveness in connection with the 57 (170/3) children who might otherwise have died of COVID-related illness during a 6-month period. At best, the Pfizer mRNA shot might be 80% effective against hospitalizations and death. That number comes directly from the FDA modeling (p. 32). I am bending over backwards to give Pfizer the benefit of considerable doubt because again, the Pfizer clinical trial showed NO reduction in hospitalizations or death in this age group. So injecting all 28,384,878 children ages 5 to 11 with two doses of Pfizer (which is what the Biden administration wants to do) would save, at most, 45 lives (0.8 effectiveness x 57 fatalities that otherwise would have occurred during that time period = 45). So then the NNTV to prevent a single fatality in this age group is 630,775 (28,384,878 / 45). But it’s a two dose regimen so if one wants to calculate the NNTV per injection the number doubles to 1,261,550. It’s literally the worst NNTV in the history of vaccination. If you inject that many children, you certainly will have lots and lots of serious side effects including disability and death. So let’s look at the risk side of the equation. Here’s the risk model: Because the Pfizer clinical trial has no useable data, I have to immuno-bridge from the nearest age group. 31,761,099 people (so just about 10% more people than in the 5 to 11 age bracket) ages 12 to 24 have gotten at least one coronavirus shot. The COVID-19 vaccine program has only existed for 10 months and younger people have only had access more recently (children 12 to 15 have had access for five months; since May 10) — so we’re looking at roughly the same observational time period as modeled above. During that time, there are 128 reports of fatal side effects following coronavirus mRNA injections in people 12 to 24. (That’s through October 22, 2021. There is a reporting lag though so the actual number of reports that have been filed is surely higher). Kirsch, Rose, and Crawford (2021) estimate that VAERS undercounts fatal reactions by a factor of 41 which would put the total fatal side effects in this age-range at 5,248. (Kirsch et al. represents a conservative estimate because others have put the underreporting factor at 100.) With potentially deadly side effects including myo- and pericarditis disproportionately impacting youth it is reasonable to think that over time the rate of fatal side effects from mRNA shots in children ages 5 to 11 might be similar to those in ages 12 to 24. So, to put it simply, the Biden administration plan would kill 5,248 children via Pfizer mRNA shots in order to save 45 children from dying of coronavirus. For every one child saved by the shot, another 117 would be killed by the shot. The Pfizer mRNA shot fails any honest risk-benefit analysis in children ages 5 to 11. Even under the best circumstances, estimating NNTV and modeling risk vs. benefits is fraught. In the current situation, with a new and novel bioengineered virus, where Pfizer’s data are intentionally underpowered to hide harms, and the FDA, CDC, & Biden Administration are doing everything in their power to push dangerous drugs on kids, making good policy decisions is even more difficult. If the FDA or CDC want to calculate a different NNTV (and explain how they arrived at that number) I’m all ears. But we all know that the FDA refused to calculate an NNTV not because they forgot, but because they knew the number was so high that it would destroy the case for mRNA vaccines in children this age. Your move CDC — your own Guidance document states that you must provide this number. Update: CDC finally mentions NNTV, but . . . Toward the end of the six-hour CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Nov. 2 meeting where the committee voted to recommend Pfizer’s EUA vaccine for children 5 - 11, there was finally a mention of NNTV. It was on slide 36 of a presentation by CDC official D.r Sara Oliver. Unfortunately the CDC estimate was untethered from reality. I’ll explain: Oliver claimed the NNTV to prevent a single case is 10, even though the best lower bound estimate is 88 and other estimates are 200 or higher (see calculations here and here). Then she claimed the NNTV to prevent a single hospitalization is between 2,213 and 8,187. This is dishonest and a violation of scientific norms. NNTV is calculated by dividing 1 by the Absolute Risk Reduction. There was no Absolute Risk Reduction in hospitalizations in the Pfizer clinical trial in kids 5 to 11, because no one was hospitalized in either the treatment or control group. 1/0 is “undefined” not 8,187. Oliver made no estimate of NNTV to prevent a single COVID-19-related death because that is also undefined (again, there were no COVID-related deaths in the treatment or placebo group in the trial so the absolute risk reduction was zero). Oliver also did not model injuries or deaths from the vaccine (she immuno-bridged from an older age group to show benefits but ignored the reported harms from the vaccine in the older age group). I should also note that my estimates of NNTV were based on CDC data showing 170 deaths from COVID-19-related illness in kids ages 5 to 11 over the last 18 months (I got the number directly from the CDC COVID tracking website). However at the ACIP meeting, the CDC said the number of children in this age group who have died of COVID-19-related illness is 94. If 94 is the correct number to use, then the NNTV to prevent a single death from COVID-19 related illness in this age group would be 28,384,878 / 31 = 915,641. But it’s a two-dose regimen, so if one wants to calculate the NNTV-per-injection the number doubles to 1,831,282. I imagine that at most, half of American parents will be foolish enough to inject this toxic product into their kids. At a 50% uptake rate, the ACIP decision to approve the Pfizer shot will likely kill 2,624 children via adverse reactions in order to potentially save 12 from COVID-19-related illness. Now you know why the CDC did not release the meeting materials prior to the ACIP meeting — they could not stand up to any public scrutiny.",other
267,"Donald Trump would defeat both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris if the former president decides to run in 2024, a new poll revealed Thursday. According to a Rasmussen Reports poll, in a race between Trump and Biden in 2024, 51 percent of possible voters said they would vote for Trump, whereas just 41 percent said they would choose Biden. Independent voters would also overwhelmingly choose the GOP candidate, selecting Trump over Biden by 20 points. The gap in a Trump versus Harris election is even bigger, with Trump topping the Vice President 52 percent to 39 percent. Additionally, one-fifth of Democrats said they would pick Trump rather than either Biden or Harris. When survey participants were asked whether or not Trump should run for president again, 48 percent of likely voters said he should run, while 44 percent said he should not. The Rasmussen poll was conducted from September 21-22 and surveyed 1,000 likely voters. President Biden’s approval rating among Americans continues to drop as a number of crises grip the United States, including thousands of illegal immigrants crossing the southern border, Americans stranded in Afghanistan following Biden’s disastrous withdrawal, and looming COVID-19 mandates. According to a recent Gallup poll, the president’s approval sits in negative territory at just 43 percent, dropping 6 points in one month alone. The survey, which was conducted from September 1-17, also showed that Biden has a 53 percent disapproval rate. “Independents have shown the greatest variation in their opinions of how Biden is doing. Biden’s current 37% approval rating among independents is his lowest to date and 24 points below his personal high of 61%. Two-thirds of Biden’s slide among independents since he took office has occurred in the past three months,” Gallup noted in the survey. Former President Trump has hinted that he will run for the White House again in 2024. On Saturday, September 25, Mr. Trump is holding another rally in Georgia as a “continuation of President Trump’s many appearances in support of candidates and causes that further the MAGA legacy and accomplishments of President Trump’s Administration.” On Wednesday, former President Trump wrote in an email provided to American Military News that “we are losing our country.” “We are losing our Country! The Democrats are vicious and fight like hell, and the Republicans do nothing about it. RINOs fight harder against Republicans than they do against Democrats. They want to be so politically correct, even if that means losing our Country, which is happening now,” Trump wrote, later adding, “Remember, the Fake News Media does not report the truth!”",other
268,"The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) approved a measure last month that could pave the way for the Catholic Church to deny President Joe Biden communion. The conservative bishops hope to prevent Biden from participating in the sacred ritual because of his support for abortion rights. Biden is a devout Catholic who considered becoming a priest in his youth. He rarely misses mass, holds a rosary while making critical decisions, and often quotes scriptures. When asked about the bishops' decision Biden said it is ""a private matter and I don't think that's going to happen."" The bishops hope the new guidance would push ""Catholics who are cultural, political, or parochial leaders to witness the faith."" Monsignor Jeffrey Burrill, the general secretary of the USCCB, has been forced to step down due to some serious allegations about his private life. Burrill, a priest from Wisconsin, worked for the USCCB for the past five years and was elected general secretary last year. ""On Monday, we became aware of impending media reports alleging possible improper behavior by Msgr. Burrill. What was shared with us did not include allegations of misconduct with minors. However, in order to avoid becoming a distraction to the operations and ongoing work of the Conference, Monsignor has resigned effective immediately,"" Archbishop Jose Gomez wrote in a memo to U.S. bishops. The PIllar, a Catholic publication, found evidence that the priest engaged in ""serial sexual misconduct."" An analysis of Burrill's phone found that it was emitting data signals from Grindr, a location-based hookup app, on a near-daily basis during parts of 2018, 2019, and 2020. Grindr is an app designed to bring together gay and bisexual men for sexual encounters. Signals showed that he also visited gay bars and private residences associated with the app. While using an app to meet people for sexual encounters shouldn't be frowned upon, it's a big no-no in the Catholic church. Especially for someone in a leadership position. Friar Thomas Berg, a professor of moral theology at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, New York, told The Pillar that use of such apps is strictly against Catholic doctrine. Berg said that ""according to canon law and the Church's tradition, clerics are obliged to observe 'perfect and perpetual continence,' as a reflection of what should be our lived pursuit of our spousal relationship with the Church and with Christ."" Homosexuality, along with all sexual activity outside of heterosexual marriage, is considered a sin in Catholic doctrine. Burrill appears to be an even bigger hypocrite because the USCCB has opposed LGBTQ equality, same-sex adoption, and the development of an LGBTQ suicide hotline. It has also promoted anti-trans legislation. It always seems to be that the religious folks who judge the harshest always wind up having something to hide. It's a shame that Catholics such as Burrill are forced by doctrine to live their lives in the shadows. But shouldn't that make them more compassionate towards fellow sinners instead of the first to judge?",other
269,"Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York continues to raise the bar with regard to hyperbolic and absurd statements. Following the Jan. 6 Capitol incursion, in which the congresswoman was never in any apparent danger, she has disclosed she is in therapy. Ocasio-Cortez also compared the experiences of lawmakers on that day to those of troops who have fought in actual combat. During an interview published last week with Latino USA, the New York Democrat spoke extensively about the riot that briefly suspended now-President Joe Biden’s Electoral College certification. That riot was so emotionally scarring, according to AOC, that lawmakers, such as herself, might as well have “served in war” after the legislative process was briefly disrupted. Advertisement - story continues below “It’s politically sensitive. No one wants to discuss, no one wants to say, ‘oh, boo-hoo,’ but there’s members of Congress that, served in war,” she said, before describing how she worried about how safe Capitol employees, such as food service workers, were during the incursion. She then talked about the aftermath of the violence on herself.“After the 6th, I took some time and it was really [Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts], when I spoke to her what happened to me, like the day of, because I ran to her office and she was like, ‘you need to recognize trauma,’” Ocasio-Cortez told the outlet. How bad was that “trauma?” So severe that the second-term Democratic House member said she’s in therapy to cope with the experience. “Oh yeah, I’m doing therapy but also I’ve just slowed down,” she said. “I think the Trump administration had a lot of us, especially Latino communities, in a very reactive mode. And so, I’ve been putting myself in a more practice space.” AOC in fact compared her perception of the Capitol incursion to the death of her father.“I was freezing, but I just felt like I needed to be away from all these people and all of this, like, you know, busyness,” she said.“It’s been so therapeutic… I feel like it’s been one of the most helpful things for me in resetting than almost anything else that I’ve done.” What an insult to combat veterans everywhere. Ironically, AOC wasn’t even in the Capitol building during the riot which she claimed has left her traumatized. The lawmaker was actually in the nearby Cannon building.In a February fact-check in which The Associated Press attempted to prop up AOC’s embellishing the event, the wire service noted the following: “In an Instagram Live video about the riots, she explained that she was in her office in a neighboring building on the Capitol complex, where she experienced a frightening encounter with a Capitol police officer who she said didn’t announce himself.” The AP added: “Ocasio-Cortez’s office is across the street from the main Capitol building, in the Cannon building, which AP reporters on the scene confirmed was evacuated during the riots.” “The Cannon building is also connected to the Capitol building by a series of tunnels, which allow members of Congress to travel between buildings underground,” the AP added. You’d think from hearing AOC speak about Jan. 6 that she was wielding an office chair and fending off MAGA raiders. In fact, her only notable tense interaction with anyone, as far as she has disclosed, was with a cop who knocked on a door to check on her in a separate building. That’s not exactly a harrowing tale of survival. AOC almost certainly belongs in therapy, but it’s difficult to believe her claims that that treatment is rooted in the events of Jan. 6.",other
270,"Mississippi has recorded 72 fetal deaths in unvaccinated pregnant women infected with the coronavirus, state health officials announced Wednesday, sounding the alarm on the virus’s danger in pregnancy. Speaking during a news conference, Mississippi State Health Officer Thomas Dobbs said those deaths had occurred since the start of the pandemic. The number, which includes only deaths that occurred past 20 weeks of gestation, “is twice the background rate of what would be expected,” he said. “That’s quite a number of tragedies that, sadly, would be preventable right now,” Dobbs said, referring to the availability of vaccines. He said the state is also investigating the deaths of eight pregnant women who were infected with the virus. Those deaths occurred over approximately the past four weeks, during the delta variant-fueled surge, he said. Many underwent emergency Caesarean sections in an attempt to save their babies. Advertisement Citing those cases, Dobbs and other state health leaders urged those who are pregnant to get the shot that can protect them from the virus. “We encourage you to please get vaccinated,” said State Epidemiologist Paul Byers, noting that his daughter had recently delivered a healthy baby after rolling up her sleeve. “That’s going to be the best way to ensure that you and your babies stay healthy.” Research has found that pregnant and recently pregnant women face a higher risk of becoming severely ill from covid-19, with an increased likelihood of requiring hospitalization, intensive care and use of a ventilator. Those who contract the virus in pregnancy are also at greater risk of preterm birth. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month began urging coronavirus vaccination in pregnant women, after studies found no increased risk of miscarriage among those who got the shots. Immunization rates are low in the expectant population, with just 24 percent having received at least one shot, according to the CDC. Advertisement “The vaccines are safe and effective, and it has never been more urgent to increase vaccinations as we face the highly transmissible Delta variant and see severe outcomes from covid-19 among unvaccinated pregnant people,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement last month. In Mississippi, the overall vaccination rate has remained stubbornly low. With just under 40 percent fully vaccinated and 48 percent partially vaccinated, its vaccination rate is second-to-last in the nation. The delta variant has hit hard in the state, where recent weeks have been the worst of the pandemic, according to data compiled by The Washington Post. The average number of infections was hovering at about 2,800, down from the 3,586 recorded Aug. 20, but still far above the numbers seen before this summer. Advertisement Almost 1,300 people were hospitalized, and the state recorded its highest number of deaths in a single day Monday, with 124. Per capita, it is now second in the nation in total coronavirus deaths, at 285. (New Jersey, the leader in deaths per capita, stands at 303.) Dobbs lamented the state’s standing during a live-streamed discussion Friday with Mississippi State Medical Association President Mark Horne, saying that “it doesn’t have to be this way.” “In Mississippi, we’re complacent about being last,” Dobbs said. “Aren’t we? And if you see some folks out there talking, they’re saying, ‘This is inevitable; people are going to die; it’s not worth trying.’ That is a loser mentality, right? Other people don’t do this badly.” He noted that the state recorded almost 900 deaths in August, including 61 people who were between 18 and 31 years old. Advertisement “Not a single one of them was vaccinated,” Dobbs said. “I feel confident, if they had been vaccinated, every single one of those people would be with us today.

271,"There is renewed hope that America may soon be saved from Nancy Pelosi’s reign of terror according to a new poll showing that the Democrats are likely to lose control of the House Of Representatives next year. Despite losing seats in November’s elections, Pelosi has doubled down on extremism with her entire caucus unified behind pushing through Joe Biden’s radical agenda. This agenda includes D.C. statehood, new voting laws that will imperial election integrity, sweeping new “domestic terrorism” legislation that would unleash the government on Trump supporters and the illegal immigration disaster. Those positions do not have support according to the survey conducted by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) that shows that Pelosi is by far the most unpopular politician in the country and her party is widely despised. According to a memo released by NRCC, voters in “ticket-splitting” districts that went for Trump; “Democrats in these districts are going to have an uphill battle defending their decisions to vote in lockstep with Pelosi’s socialist agenda.” There is also the matter of the Democrats’ support of the violent race riots that have terrorized Americans most recently seen when Rep. Maxine Waters traveled to Minneapolis to encourage rioting and looting right before the verdict in the George Floyd murder trial and Rep. Rashida Tlab’s call for eliminating the police who she accused of engaging in “government funded’ murder.The poll was conducted across 85 battleground congressional districts also finds that: a majority “do not believe that President Biden’s COVID-19 stimulus is helping them and their family,” that most “do not believe the Democrats’ false promises that Biden’s proposed tax increases will just be on the wealthy,” and that “an overwhelming 75 percent “of voters see the border situation as a crisis or a major problem.” There is also much skepticism over Biden’s out-of-control spending, much of it driven by his big “infrastructure” bill that is less about repairing roads and bridges and more about far-left social engineering, race-based giveaways, and Green New Deal priorities like electric cars. Further adding to Democrats’ woes is the coming loss of House seats in California, New York, and other blue states due to the U.S. Census Bureau’s announcement that population shifts out of the party’s strongholds have resulted in residents fleeing for freer and safer destinations.For the first time ever, Pelosi’s home state has lost a seat. And while it won’t officially shift until after the midterm elections, it marks a trend as California has increasingly become a dystopian, authoritarian hellscape due to decades of ruinous Democrat rule. People are voting with their feet and are leaving in droves to relocate to free states like Florida and Texas which will both get more House seats.
Democrats are going to have a hard time generating the same kind of voter enthusiasm as they did in 2018 and 2020. That could lead to them facing a bloodbath next year that ends Pelosi’s era of legislative terrorism and banishes them from power for a good long time.

278,"The Justice Department's investigation into Russian election meddling and any ties to the Trump campaign has cost more than $25 million since it started in the spring of 2017, according to Justice Department documents released Friday. Special counsel Robert Mueller's office spent nearly $4.6 million to operate from April through the end of September, on top of $3.9 million in costs incurred by the DOJ and FBI connected to Mueller's investigation. Previous documents the Justice Department released revealed costs of nearly $17 million related to the probe from May 2017 through March 2018. That $4.6 million figure includes roughly $2.9 million spent on compensation and benefits, $580,000 on travel and transportation, and $943,000 spent on rent, communications and utilities. Mueller's investigation has resulted in a slew of indictments and convictions. Among those convicted is former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Former Trump attorney Michael Cohen has also pleaded guilty to charges including lying to Congress and campaign finance violations. On Wednesday, he was sentenced to three years in prison. President Trump has declared Mueller's investigation a ""witch hunt"" and a ""taxpayer-funded charade."" He claimed without providing evidence last month that the investigation has cost more than $40 million. ""When will this illegal Joseph McCarthy style Witch Hunt, one that has shattered so many innocent lives, ever end-or will it just go on forever?

Mr. Trump has said he has no plans to fire Mueller, despite his repeated attacks on the investigation. Trump allies, including Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and some Republicans in Congress, have called for Mueller to end his investigation.",other
279,"The dramatic melting of Arctic ice is already driving extreme weather that affects hundreds of millions of people across North America, Europe and Asia, leading climate scientists have told the Guardian.
Severe “snowmageddon” winters are now strongly linked to soaring polar temperatures, say researchers, with deadly summer heatwaves and torrential floods also probably linked. The scientists now fear the Arctic meltdown has kickstarted abrupt changes in the planet’s swirling atmosphere, bringing extreme weather in heavily populated areas to the boil. The northern ice cap has been shrinking since the 1970s, with global warming driving the loss of about three-quarters of its volume so far. But the recent heat in the Arctic has shocked scientists, with temperatures 33C above average in parts of the Russian Arctic and 20C higher in some other places. In November, ice levels hit a record low, and we are now in “uncharted territory”, said Prof Jennifer Francis, an Arctic climate expert at Rutgers University in the US, who first became interested in the region when she sailed through it on a round-the-world trip in the 1980s. “These rapid changes in the Arctic are affecting weather patterns where you live right now,” she said. “In the past you have had natural variations like El Niño, but they have never happened before in combination with this very warm Arctic, so it is a whole new ball game. “It is inconceivable that this ridiculously warm Arctic would not have an impact on weather patterns in the middle latitudes further south, where so many people live. “It’s safe to say [the hot Arctic] is going to have a big impact, but it’s hard to say exactly how big right now. But we are going to have a lot of very interesting weather – we’re not going to get around that one.” The area covered by Arctic sea ice at least four years old has decreased from 718,000 sq miles in September 1984 to 42,000 sq miles in September 2016. Older ice tends to be less vulnerable to melting. The age of the ice is indicated by shades ranging from blue-gray for the youngest ice to white for the oldest. Credits: Nasa The chain of events that links the melting Arctic with weather to the south begins with rising global temperatures causing more sea ice to melt. Unlike on the Antarctic continent, melting ice here exposes dark ocean beneath, which absorbs more sunlight than ice and warms further. This feedback loop is why the Arctic is heating up much faster than the rest of the planet.
This in turn narrows the temperature difference between the Arctic and lower latitudes, which is crucial because it is the temperature gradient between them that drives the jet stream wind, which streaks around the pole at up to 250mph and about 8km above the surface. The jet stream forms a boundary between the cold north and the warmer south, but the lower temperature difference means the winds are now weaker. This means the jet stream meanders more, with big loops bringing warm air to the frozen north and cold air into warmer southern climes. Furthermore, researchers say, the changes mean the loops can remain stuck over regions for weeks, rather than being blown westwards as in the past. This “blocking” effect means extreme events can unfold.
“There have been recent studies showing very plausible physical mechanisms of how rapid warming in the Arctic can influence weather in the mid latitudes, both in summer and winter,” said Dim Coumou at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. Coumou is a former offshore industry geophysicist who has studied the link between extreme weather events and global warming since 2010. “A couple of years ago this was the main criticism on any such links, that the physics was not well understood,” he said. “But the big question [now] is, how important are these mechanisms?” The other main influence on the jet stream is sea surface temperature in the tropics, which waxes and wanes with El Niño, while solar cycles and even volcanic eruptions have smaller effects. The clearest connection so far between the melting Arctic and weather is for extreme winter conditions, such as the intense winters that hit parts of North America and northern Europe in 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2013-14, causing record snowfalls and billions of dollars of damage. In those years, the jet stream deviated deeply southwards over those regions, pulling down savagely cold air. Prof Adam Scaife, a climate modelling expert at the UK’s Met Office, said the evidence for a link to shrinking Arctic ice was now good: “The consensus points towards that being a real effect.” While downswings of the jet stream can bring freezing winters, the accompanying upswings have been linked to worsening the drought in California. “These northward jet stream swings are of course the reason California is having such a terrible drought,” said Francis. This effect was in fact predicted back in 2004, with those researchers now saying: “Reality is moving faster than we thought or hoped it would.”
But the winter extremes can also swing the other way and bring mild but torrential weather, as seen in the past two winters in the UK, leading to severe flooding, said Prof Edward Hanna, at the University of Sheffield in the UK.
150 years of global warming in a minute-long symphony Guardian He pointed to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a cyclic variation in air pressure that may be affected by the fast melting of Arctic ice. The variability of the NOA has doubled in the last century, he said: “Within the last decade, there have been wild swings in the NAO values in December.” The connection between the vanishing Arctic ice and extreme summer weather in the northern hemisphere is probable, according to scientists, but not yet as certain as the winter link. Blocking patterns caused by slow-moving meanders of the jet stream have been firmly linked to some devastating events, including the 2010 summer floods in Pakistan, which killed 2,000 people and affected 20 million, and also the searing heatwave in Russia in the same year, which killed 50,000 people and wiped out $15bn (£12bn) of crops. Villagers stand outside their homes during flash floods on the outskirts of Peshawar, Pakistan, April 2016
“We also see such summer events more often in recent years,” said Coumou. Blocking events have also been linked to summer deluges in the UK, leading to disastrous flooding in 2007 and 2012 which caused billions of pounds in damage.
The year 2012 was also an extreme year for Greenland, with record melting across its entire surface flushing water into the ocean and accelerating sea level rise. The hot loop of air that sat on Greenland that year may also be linked to one of the biggest weather disasters of recent years: Hurricane Sandy, which killed 233 people and cost $75bn in damages. Scientists suspect that the blocking event over Greenland, potentially linked to the record low Arctic ice that summer, prevented the hurricane veering north-east out into the Atlantic like most storms. Instead, blocked by the high pressure, Sandy swung left over the most populated area of the east coast of the US. Damage caused by Hurricane Sandy in Rodanthe, North Carolina, October 2012
Another consequence of the fast melting Arctic raises the possibility that there may be even worse extreme weather to come, according to a few scientists: titanic Atlantic superstorms and hurricanes barreling across Europe.
The melting of Greenland ice is pouring about 250bn tonnes a year of fresh water, which is less dense than salty sea water, into the ocean. As a result, the water mass sinks less and the current that drags warm water up the Atlantic is weakened – scientists have already found that the current is at its weakest for a millennium. This means a region of the north Atlantic is becoming relatively cool and this exaggerates the contrast with tropical waters to the south, which is the driver for storms. In the worst case scenario, said the renowned climate scientist Prof James Hansen, this “will drive superstorms, stronger than any in modern times – all hell will break loose in the north Atlantic and neighbouring lands”.
Hansen– who was one of the first scientists to alert the world to the dangers of climate change in 1988 and has been arrested more than once outside the White House while protesting against fossil fuel developments – pointed to the historical record as a precedent: 118,000 years ago a superstorm tossed 1,000-tonne mega boulders on to the shores of the Bahamas.
“I would certainly not call such [superstorm] scenarios ridiculous,” said Coumou. “But it is speculative – we don’t have the hard evidence.”
But even with what is known so far, there is cause for concern that the complex interactions are turning the slow burn of global temperature rise into sudden weather disasters.
“The worrying aspect is that such dynamical changes can occur more abruptly than simple background warming of the climate,” said Coumou. “Dynamical changes can change more rapidly and can therefore lead to surprises and I think there are many such possibilities in the system.” A polar bear swims in Svalbard. The fjords there would usually be partially covered with sea ice, but last winter most of the archipelago was surrounded by open water. 
Amid the gloomy prospects, there is some cause for hope however. “A large fraction of the US public still doesn’t believe that it is humans that are affecting the climate system,” said Francis. “But one of the silver linings of this pretty dark cloud is that the Arctic is such an obvious and conspicuous change, that anybody can see them happening. There is no ambiguity whatsoever.”
But this changing of minds needs to happen quickly, said Hansen: “If we wait for the natural world to reveal itself clearly, it may be too late.”",other

282,"The immune system is something that is highly misunderstood not just by everyday people but also by the many conventional doctors who we depend on for health advice.  Most people resort to things like synthetic vitamins and medicines ignoring better natural alternatives to deal with colds and improve immunity, but the cycle of sickness always seems to continue.  For people with compromised immune systems, there are many natural options, and now researchers have discovered what could well be one of the best ways to reset and recharge your immune system; one that happens to be free and is believed to work even in the elderly as well.  White blood cells right help immune response, and they can be recycled through fasting, the study showed.  Three Days to a Whole New Immune System  According to researchers at the University of Southern California, the act of fasting for as little as three days can regenerate the entire immune system, even in elderly people.  The researchers said that fasting helps the body’s stem cells to begin producing new white blood cells, which help to fight off infection.  They added that the discovery could be especially effective for people suffering from damaged immune systems, including chemotherapy patients, who were protected from the toxic impacts of the treatment during the fasting period.  Flipping a “Regenerative Switch”  The researchers said that fasting helps the body’s stem cells to begin producing new white blood cells which help to fight off infection in the body.  “Fasting gives the ‘OK’ for stem cells to go ahead and begin proliferating and rebuild the entire system,” Prof. Valter Longo, Professor of Gerontology and the Biological Sciences at the University of Southern California, told the UK’s The Telegraph.  He added that the body actually removed parts that were damaged, old or inefficient during the fasting process, creating “literally, a new immune system.”  According to Dr. Longo a person’s system recycles unneeded immune cells, especially damaged ones, in order to create energy while they are fasting.  Over the course of his study’s trials, participants were asked to regularly fast between 2-4 days over a 6 month period.  The study was released in June and Dr. Longo said that clinical trials must still be completed, but added that the research looks “very promising.”  sources: telegraph, althealthworks, cell, medicalnewstoday, nationalpost, usc",other

Children’s Health Defense CHD and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., CHD’s Chairman and Chief Legal Counsel, ask that you watch and share this video so that you, and others, may make an informed decision of whether or not to give your child, boy or girl, a Gardasil vaccine. It can also be a useful tool for pediatricians who are trying to understand how this vaccine, that is actually causing health problems with young people, could have been approved by FDA and then recommended by CDC. The video is full of jaw-dropping facts about Gardasil and the clinical trials leading up to its release upon an unsuspecting public.  Transcript of “The Science” presentation:  Download “The Science” Transcript  Children’s Health Defense and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—Science Day Presentation for Gardasil  Hi, I’m Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and I’m making this video for the sake of parents who are trying to make an informed decision of whether or not to give their child, their boy or girl the Gardasil vaccine.  I’m also making this video as a tool for pediatricians who are trying to understand how this vaccine—if it’s actually causing all of these problems with young girls—could have been approved by FDA and then mandated by CDC.  Virtually all of the things that I’m going to talk about in this video are available to the public on public documents as I’m going to show.  Finally, I want to say this about Merck which is the company that makes the Gardasil vaccine.  Many of the things that I’m going to say today would be slanderous if they were not true. And if they’re not true then Merck should sue me. But Merck won’t do that and they won’t do it because in the United States truth is an absolute defense to slander. And second of all Merck knows that if they sue me, I’m going to immediately file a discovery request, and many, many, more documents are going to emerge that illustrate even more fraud by this company on the American public and the people all over the world.  Finally, as a footnote I’m not going to talk today about the specific biological mechanisms that allow this vaccine to cause harm in human beings. That information is out there it’s in dozens of peer-reviewed, published scientific documents. Many of these are described on our website and I urge people to go to the Children’s Health Defense website to educate themselves on those issues.  Today we’re going to talk about the clinical trial about Merck’s fraud in that process…and this is Merck’s claim:  The HPV vaccine will “eliminate cervical cancers and other HPV associated cancers.”  The danger of dying from HPV cancer in this country is 1 death in 43.5 thousand people.  Imagine you have a deck of cards but instead of 50 cards. There’s 43,500 on a on a big, big table and one of those cards is a black card. If you get that, you die.  So, Merck’s deal is that it’s going to remove that black card from the deck. But in order to play the game and make sure that Merck removes the black card, everybody who participates has to put in $420 because that’s the cost of the three-dose Gardasil vaccine.  So, here’s Gardasil by the numbers. So, the cost of the three-jab series average is about $420. There are 76 million children who essentially have been mandated by CDC to receive these vaccines. A blockbuster product from Merck, and global revenues from this vaccine today are about $2.3 billion dollars. It’s the third largest product in the company’s inventory.  The cost of saving one American life is 18.3 million dollars. People could argue whether or not that’s a reasonable value of a human life. What I would say was is that the criteria that we should use for evaluating reasonableness—is there a cheaper way to save more lives? And people would argue that Pap smears are the most effective way that 80 percent of cervical cancer deaths have already been eliminated by Pap smears. And this is the most effective technology.  Incidentally in another context HHS has already put a value on human life and the value is $250k. That is the maximum number that the vaccine compensation program will pay for killing an American citizen.  Prior to marketing the vaccine, the FDA licenses the vaccine, and in that licensing process Merck had to show that the vaccine was safe. According to Federal regulations the word “safety” means “relative freedom from harmful effects, taking into consideration the character of the product in relationship to the condition of the recipient at that time.”  So, what is the condition of the recipients of that target group for this vaccine. And this vaccine targets millions of preteens and teens, for whom the risk of dying from cervical cancer is practically zero. Cervical cancer’s median age of death is 58. It is first diagnosed at age 50 median.  A teenage girl or boy has zero chance of dying of this illness. Which means the threshold for giving this medication is very, very high.  Secondly it is mandated in some jurisdictions So the government is actually—government officials are actually—coming in and ordering people to take this medical intervention. So, we have to be sure that the threshold for risk, “the risk profile” for that medical intervention should be very, very low.  Third, unlike other medical interventions Gardasil recipients are perfectly healthy. So, when you give medication to a healthy individual you have to make sure that the risk profile is practically zero. And in order to determine risk, there is a standardized protocol. And it’s called double-blind placebo studies. What does that mean?  It means that the drug company that’s trying to license this product gives the medication to one group of people, maybe 5,000 or 10,000 people, and gives a placebo, an inert placebo, either an identical looking pill that is inert—it’s either saline or sugar—to a similarly situated group of 5,000 or 10,000 people and it’s double blind meaning that neither the patients nor the researchers knew who got the placebo and who got the actual medication.  And you can see here, here’s what the NIH says about the National Institute for Health placebos: an inactive substance that looks like a drug.  So here are typical examples:  Lipitor was given during its study phase to about 17k subjects. Half of them received Lipitor half of them received a sugar pill that looked identical to Lipitor and they were observed and studied for up to 3.3 years.  Why for so long? Because many of the injuries that are caused by medication are latent—they don’t show up for two or three or four or five years cancer for example may not show up for four or five years after the exposure. Autoimmune diseases and allergies and these kind of things take a long time to diagnose. Enbrel for that reason was delayed for 6.6 years and against a control group that received a saline injection.  Botox, there was a national emergency to get Botox to market so people could get their wrinkles cured, was studied for 51 weeks and it was studied against a saline injection.  Now I’m going to show you one of the really outrageous frauds that Merck committed during the clinical trials. This is an insert that is part of every vaccine package. And you can go on the Internet right now and look up that Merck product and search and find these two tables.  In the initial table you can see a there are three columns and this is a table that just looks at injuries at the vaccine site for redness and itching and bruising and pain at the vaccine site and they use one…there were 5,000 girls—5,088 girls who got the Gardasil vaccine.  Number two, there were 3,470 girls who got the AAHS control, what is that? That is the adjuvant in the vaccine. That is a toxic neurotoxin, that’s put in the vaccine to make it more long-lasting to provoke an immune response in the subject of the vaccine.  And most people believe that it is that aluminum adjuvant that is causing all of these injuries in the girls who are getting the vaccine. And there were 3,470 people who received just the neurotoxin with no antigens and no other vaccine components.  And you have a third group which is the placebo group. What I want you to look at is at these numbers. That in the Gardasil and AAHS control there is virtually the same number of injuries.  And when you get to the saline placebo, that injury rate is cut in half.  Now let’s go to the table where they talk about real systemic injuries…autoimmune diseases, and instead of showing us real science, which is to show us what happened to the saline group, they hide the saline group as a way of fooling you, your pediatrician and the regulatory agency by compressing it into the aluminum group and they never tell us. They say this is a combination of the aluminum adjuvant and the saline placebo. They don’t tell us how many in each category were compressed there. The real thing that you need to watch here is what happened.  These are all very, very serious injuries. These are injuries that in some cases people would feel were worse than death—and that affect people and debilitate for a lifetime in many cases.  And if you look at the bottom of the Gardasil group an astonishing 2.3 percent of the girls in the clinical study who received the Gardasil vaccine got ill from autoimmune diseases, many within seven months of taking the vaccine.  And look what happened in the aluminum group—the same number exactly. 2.3 percent.  Nobody, no parent would allow their daughter to take a substance that had a one-in-40 chance of giving them a lifetime disability.  World Health Organization says that using a spiked placebo, or a faux-cebo as Merck did with Gardasil, puts you at a methodological disadvantage that “it may be difficult or impossible to assess vaccine safety.”  Dr. Stanley Plotkin, who developed the polio vaccine…who developed the pertussis vaccine, who developed the rotavirus vaccine—the Stanley Plotkin award is the Nobel Prize of vaccinology it’s given to the top vaccinologist every year—and what he says is:  Unless you have a true control group you are in LA LA LAND.  Finally, the American Medical Association says the absence of double-blind placebo testing and short-term studies of chronic disease are “the indicia of marketing masquerading as science.”  And that’s what Merck gave us.  The Cochrane Collaboration—thirty thousand scientists from all over the world who came together to create an independent assessment of medical protocols which they saw as being increasingly controlled by the industry—The Cochrane Collaboration said the use of active comparators probably increased the occurrence of harms and the comparative group thereby masking harms created by the HPV vaccine.  And that indeed was Merck’s point…to hide those harms.  So, if you do the math women are 100 times more likely to suffer serious adverse events from the Gardasil vaccine than they are to be protected from cervical cancer.  So now we have a very different bargain in this card game that we’re playing with Merck.  If 43 thousand cards and the black card—the death card is gone—but now, there are a thousand blue cards which if you pick one of those by mistake you have a good chance of getting an autoimmune disease. Nobody would take that bargain.  So, in order to get the FDA license to market this vaccine Merck did a number of studies, which are called protocols. We don’t know how many they did because they’re not telling us they never disclosed it.  The one we’re most concerned with is protocol 18. The reason protocol 18 is critical is because that was the basis for FDA giving Merck the license to produce and market the vaccine.  Why is that? Because protocol 18 is the only one in which the target audience for this vaccine. 11- and 12-year old girls was actually tested, and had a control group. The other ones looked at big cohorts of women were 16 to 25-year old and 16 to 26-year old women.  Protocol 18 looked at girls and boys from ages 9 to 15. It was a total of 1200 children. and almost 600 controls. That is a very, very, tiny group of people to study in order to determine the safety of a product is going to be marketed to billions of children around the world.  Now I’m going to show you one of the key fraudulent flimflams that Merck used to get this license. FDA said they approved Gardasil based on protocol 18 because protocol 18 was of particular interest because it’s the only protocol in which Merck used a true saline placebo instead of the aluminum adjuvant as a control.  That’s what Merck told FDA and the CDC but Merck was lying. It actually did not use a true saline placebo. It used what Merck called the “carrier solution.” Which is all of the components of the vaccine except for the aluminum and the viral particles the antigen.  Among the compounds that we know were in the carrier solution are Polysorbate 80 which we have no idea what the safety profile is because it’s never been tested for safety independently in vaccines. Sodium borate which is borax which is banned by FDA in food products and all food products in the United States, and is banned altogether in Europe, genetically modified yeast, there’s no safety test ever been done on it in vaccines L-histidine, the same, and possibly DNA fragments.  I say possibly because we know there are DNA fragments in the final vaccine, we don’t know how they got there. And Merck has lied about the DNA fragments from the outset.  And despite these potentially toxic components of compounds that are in the vaccine, the 596 children that were given the carrier solution fared much better in the other than any other cohort in the study. The girls and boys who receive the carrier solution were the only significant cohorts with no serious adverse events for the first 15 days.  And here’s another one of the gravamen of the fraud that Merck committed in its Gardasil trials, but it turns out in the protocol 18 study, it appears Merck cut the amount of aluminum that was given to the vaccine group in half. They tested a completely different formulation. If true, we theorize that they took the aluminum out to reduce the number of injuries and to mask the really bad safety profile of this vaccine.  And since the protocol 18 data are not based on the Gardasil vaccine formulation, the trial itself constitutes rank scientific fraud.  Here’s another bag of tricks that was used by Merck in order to skew the clinical trials results in favor of Gardasil.  Merck and its researchers use what they call exclusion criteria—for example people who had zero allergies, people who had prior genital infections were thrown out of the clinical trials. People who had over four sex partners in their entire lives were excluded from the trials. Anybody who had a history of immunological or nervous system disorders, people with chronic illnesses and seizure disorders, people with other medical conditions, people who had reactions to vaccine ingredients including the aluminum, yeast and the benzonase. or anybody with a history of alcohol and drug abuse.  If you really wanted to know whether the vaccine was helping people—if it was effective—wouldn’t you want those people in your study wouldn’t you want people who had a genetic vulnerability to cancer in your study to see if it actually was capable of preventing cancer.  Then Merck had one catch all exclusion category which was any condition which in the opinion of the investigator might interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives. Well, that gave Merck and its paid investigators complete control to throw people out of the study who they thought might make the study look not successful. All of these exclusionary categories gave Merck the ability to limit the study to people who were like All of these exclusionary categories gave Merck the ability to limit this study to people who were like an elite club of superheroes…the people who get the vaccine are not the same people they tested on. They tested it on the Avengers. They didn’t test it on, you know, Joe Bag-of-Donuts … the people are actually receiving this vaccine in day to day life. And by doing that they were able to mask whatever injury might show up in a larger and more vulnerable population who are actually receiving the vaccine.  Experts used an arsenal of sloppy protocols to again, hide vaccine injuries. Among these, Merck gave report cards—the daily journal report cards— only to 10 percent of the people who they tested the vaccine on and told those people only make reports for 14 days after the injection. And the report cards were only designed to collect jab site information. So, redness, itching, bruising, fever.  And they ignored altogether the autoimmune diseases and menstrual cycle problems and fertility problems and pain and dizziness and seizures and all of the other things that we’ve now seen are associated with the vaccine. In fact, there are numerous girls who report that they were injured that they attempted to report those injuries to Merck, and that Merck rebuffed them.  Furthermore, Merck gave extraordinary discretion to its researchers to determine what was a vaccine injury in what was not a vaccine injury and because there was no inert placebo, it was completely within their discretion. If a girl came back with seizures or autoimmune disease or menstrual cycle problems they could just say to the girl, well that’s not related to the vaccine.  In some cases, we know that Merck actively covered up and lied about injuries that it had a duty to report to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. For example, in the case of Christina Tarsell, a Maryland girl, who died from the Gardasil vaccine, Merck lied about that death in its official reports of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. It told the system that Christina’s doctor had told Merck that her death was the result of a virus.  And the doctor adamantly denies that. Merck has refused to remove the misinformation from the VAERS system.  Furthermore, Merck lied to the girls who participated in these studies, telling them No.1, that the placebo was saline and that it contained no other ingredients. And No. 2, that the study in which they were participating was not a safety study. They were told that there had already been safety studies and that the vaccine had been proven safe.  What did this do for Merck? It made it so the girls were less likely to report injuries associated with the vaccine. Because they believed that the vaccine that they were receiving had already been proven safe and that any injuries they did experience maybe a month or two months or three months after the vaccine must be simply coincidental and had nothing to do with the vaccine.  Despite all of these efforts by Merck to discourage those from reporting vaccine injuries during the clinical trials, half of the girls in the Gardasil group and half of them in the aluminum adjuvant group reported serious injuries after receiving the vaccine.  In order to conceal the link between these injuries and the vaccine, Merck invented a brand new medical metric that had never been heard of before called “new medical conditions” and it dismissed all of these new injuries which affected 50 percent of the girls who received the vaccine and the adjuvant as “new medical conditions”, unrelated to the vaccines, simply sad coincidences.  Many of these diseases were serious diseases—blood lymphatic diseases, anemia, endocrine diseases, autoimmune diseases, G.I., Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, vaginal infections musculoskeletal injuries, arthritis, neoplasm, Hodgkin’s disease, neurological diseases, psychiatric diseases, depression, reproductive and breast disorders, menstrual irregularities, and pain. Over 3 percent of the girls—1 in 30—in both groups required surgical and medical procedures.  So, this card game that we’re playing with Merck has now become a really bad bet.  Merck has removed the one black card but you now have a 1 in 40 chance of drawing a blue card and getting an autoimmune disease that may afflict you for the rest of your life and you have a 1 in 2 chance of having some other serious medical condition.  So now let’s look at Merck’s central claim which is that the Gardasil vaccine will prevent cervical cancer.  Merck’s in a sweet position here, let’s face it because the target group vaccine is 11-year olds, and the median age of death for cervical cancer is age 58. Merck essentially is making this bargain.  It’s telling the 11-year old girl if you take our vaccine 47 years from now you won’t die of cervical cancer. And of course, that truth is you can’t make a vaccine that proves that it’s going to prevent cancer 47 years from now. There’s no way to test for that.  So, Merck used a shortcut. It said we’re going to prove that it prevents these what it called surrogate end points. The best thing that Merck had come up with was CIN2 and CIN3 lesions which it called precancerous lesions even though most of those lesions never mature into cancer.  So how can you call something precancerous when it was never going to turn into cancer?  And here’s what a study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology said about Merck’s scheme: CIN3 is an imperfect diagnosis of precancer, and an intermediate surrogate for cancer.  Their own attorneys told them for these products, the indication is the surrogate, not the ultimate. Promotion cannot make any claim, vis-a-vis the ultimate end point, based upon the fate of a surrogate endpoint.  Merck has another problem. Recent peer reviewed scientific studies indicate that perhaps only a third of cervical cancer cases are even associated with the HPV vaccine. That would completely put the lie to Merck’s claims that Gardasil is going to eliminate cervical cancer altogether.  So now we have a really dubious deal because we need to put that black card back in the deck because now, we have doubts about whether or not this vaccine can prevent cervical cancer at all.  But the news gets worse. Gardasil may actually cause cancer. Gardasil’s insert states Gardasil has never been evaluated for potential to cause carcinogenicity or genotoxicity. And Gardasil’s ingredients include possible carcinogens including human DNA.  And look at this…This is Merck’s own pre-clinical trial records and those records show that girls or women, who already had HPV—had been exposed at some point in their life to it—actually had a negative efficacy of 44.6 percent.  What is negative efficacy? It means those girls had a 44.6 increased risk of getting those precancerous lesions. To make things even worse, there are recent scientific studies that suggest a phenomena of what is known as type replacement—some 200 different strands of HPV, some of them are more cancerous than others, and the current HPV vaccine goes after 9 of those 200 viral types. What these studies indicate is by eliminating those particular strains of the virus it opens up an ecological niche in the woman so that more lethal and virulent viruses can actually colonize that spot and dramatically increase the risk of cervical cancer.  So now Merck’s deal is looking really grim. Not only do we have a one-in-40 chance of getting an autoimmune disease and a 50 percent chance of getting some serious medical condition but now the cancer risk has been reinserted and actually amplified.  And now let’s look at some of the non-cancer injuries that Merck found in its preclinical studies.  The miscarriage rate in the preclinical studies after Gardasil doubled the background rate. The birth defects in the Gardasil group were five times the rate of birth defects from the control group. As to reproductive disorders an astonishing 10.9 percent of the women in the pool group reported reproductive disorders within seven months of receiving Gardasil compared to 1.2 percent in the placebo group. The death rate in the Gardasil group and the clinical trials was 8.5 per 10 thousand.  Death risk from this vaccine according to Merck’s own studies is 37 times the risk of dying from cervical cancer.  Oh, now look at the deal that Merck has offered us they’ve actually increased our risk of dying by 37 times.  So now let’s look at post-licensing surveillance. So, Merck can argue that we might have missed something in our pre-licensing studies but surely if there were any injuries being caused by this vaccine we would see them in post-licensing surveillance.  And the problem with that is that the post-licensing surveillance system, the principle one, is called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. The system is a voluntary system that simply does not work. It’s broken. In fact, in 2010 HHS hired another federal agency the agency for healthcare research quality and a group of Harvard researchers to study Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and those researchers found fewer than 1 percent of adverse events of vaccines are ever reported.  But even under that system, Gardasil has distinguished itself as the most dangerous vaccine ever invented.  In fact, when you compare it to Menactra which is a meningitis vaccine that’s given to the same age group—teenagers—Gardasil had an 8.5 times more emergency room visits, 12.5 times more hospitalizations, 10 times more life-threatening events and 26.5 times more disabilities than Menactra.  The vaccine court which is within HHS has made awards for numerous deaths and very, very serious injuries from the Gardasil vaccine. So, HHS itself admits that this vaccine kills people and it’s given compensation to the families that were injured.  The same wave of serious injuries and deaths that have been seen in nations around the globe, when they adopt mandates for the Gardasil vaccine. Even Gardasil’s own insert, the package insert that the company provides, acknowledges that the injuries that can be caused by this vaccine include death, pancreatitis, fatigue, malaise, immune system disorders, autoimmune diseases, anaphylaxis, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, nervous system disorders, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, that’s brain injuries, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and other neuron diseases, paralysis, seizures, Transverse myelitis, and vascular disorders.  In Australia, in 2015, the Australian Department of Health Therapeutic Goods Administration reported that the adverse rates in girls is 17 times the incidental rate for cervical cancer throughout their lifespan. The country only looked at a handful of conditions including demyelinating disorders, complex regional pain syndrome and premature ovarian failure. There are many, many other injuries that included hospitalizations that were not subject to that study.  India suspended its Gardasil trials after numerous deaths and serious injuries.  A south Asian Journal of Cancer found that “a healthy 16-year old is at zero immediate risk of dying from cervical cancer but is faced with a small, but real risk of death or serious disability from a vaccine that has yet to prevent a single case of cervical cancer.”  Japan de-recommended Gardasil three months after it had added the vaccine to the immunization schedule. Japan’s health ministry discovered adverse events reported after Gardasil’s approval were many times higher than other vaccines on the recommended schedule—these included seizures severe headaches partial paralysis complex regional pain syndrome and an undeniable causal relationship between persistent pain and the vaccination.  Japanese researchers found that the adverse event rate for the HPV vaccine was as high as nine percent and that pregnant women injected with the vaccine aborted or miscarried 30 percent of their babies.  In 2015 the Japanese Association for Medical Sciences issued official guidelines for managing symptoms of injuries caused by the Gardasil vaccine and the association announced there was no proof that this vaccine even prevents cervical cancer.  Alarmingly Merck’s own studies indicate that the Gardasil vaccine may disproportionately impact Asian women. For example, in protocol 19 there were 8 deaths among 3800 women and 7 those were Asians. That was 87 percent for Asian women, while only 31 percent of study participants were Asian.  Denmark in 2015 announced the opening of five new HPV clinics to treat women who were injured by the Gardasil vaccine. The day that they announced that opening there were 1300 applicants for treatment in those clinics.  In Colombia in 2014 800 girls in the town Carmen de Bolivar were grievously injured by Gardasil vaccine. Protests erupted all over Columbia. The attorney general of Colombia ordered the National Health Service of that country to immediately begin treating girls who were injured by the Gardasil vaccine and 2017 Colombia’s highest Constitutional Court ruled that the HPV vaccine would no longer be considered mandatory in Colombia and ordered that girls who showed symptoms after receiving the vaccine be given appropriate medical care.  Pompilio Martinez, who now teaches at the National University of Colombia, described the HPV vaccine as “a crime against humanity.”  Recent studies have shown that in nations with robust HPV vaccination programs and heavily vaccinated populations—in the UK and Sweden and Australia—were actually seeing dramatic upticks rises in the rate of cervical cancer rather than the downtrends that Merck promised everybody.  Now I’m going to show you some of the reasons why your pediatrician is insisting despite all of this evidence that your daughter or son gets the HPV vaccine. And the reason is the pediatrician is getting his information from agencies that have compromised through financial entanglements with Merck.  This is what the FDA is telling the public about vaccine safety: it says that vaccines are regulated by FDA and undergo a rigorous review of laboratory and clinical data to ensure the safety efficacy and purity and potency of these products.  But this is a very different story the FDA is acknowledging in-house, and this comes from a 2007 document—this is the year that Gardasil got its license from the FDA, FDA’s inability to keep up with scientific advances mean that American lives are at risk. FDA is evaluations and methods have remained largely unchanged over the last half century. The world looks to FDA as a leader today. Not only can the agency not lead, it cannot even keep up with the advances in science.  But, the most troubling problem at FDA is it has nothing to do with incompetence. It has to do with corruption. The panel within FDA that licenses new vaccines and anoints them as safe is called the Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, the acronym is VRBPAC. And in 2000 Congress investigated VRBPAC because of charges of corruption from outside the agency.  And here’s what the congressional committee found: the overwhelming majority of members, both voting members and consultants have substantial ties to the pharmaceutical industry.  Conflicts of interest rules employed by FDA have been weak enforcement has been lax. Committee members with substantial ties to pharmaceutical companies are given waivers to participate in committee proceedings. In many cases significant conflicts of interest are deemed to be in conflict at all.  And here are some specific examples of the conflict of the advisory committee that approves vaccines:  Three out of five FDA advisory committee members who voted to approve the rotavirus vaccine in December of 1997 had financial ties to the pharmaceutical companies that were developing different versions of the vaccine.  One of the five voting members had a 9 plus million dollar contract for a rotavirus vaccine.  One of the five voting members was the principal investigator for a Merck grant to develop the rotavirus vaccine.  One of the five voting members received approximately a million dollars from vaccine manufacturers toward vaccine development.  Once they get by FDA, vaccine companies then go to CDC, where another committee, which is called ACIP Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, will then take that vaccine that FDA has licensed and they will put it on the recommended list which means it becomes essentially mandatory for 76 million American children.  A listing on CDC’s recommended list is the holy grail for vaccine companies. It ",other
284,"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has yet again been caught exaggerating ‘global warming’ by fiddling with the raw temperature data. This time, that data concerns the recent record-breaking cold across the northeastern U.S. which NOAA is trying to erase from history. If you believe NOAA’s charts, there was nothing particularly unusual about this winter’s cold weather which caused sharks to freeze in the ocean and iguanas to drop out of trees. Here is NOAA’s January 2018 chart for Northeast U.S. – an area which includes New England along with NY, PA, NJ, DE and MD. You’d never guess from it that those regions had just experienced record-breaking cold, would you? That’s because, as Paul Homewood has discovered, NOAA has been cooking the books. Yet again – presumably for reasons more to do with ideology than meteorology – NOAA has adjusted past temperatures to look colder than they were and recent temperatures to look warmer than they were. We’re not talking fractions of a degree, here. The adjustments amount to a whopping 3.1 degrees F. This takes us well beyond the regions of error margins or innocent mistakes and deep into the realm of fiction and political propaganda. Homewood first smelt a rat when he examined the New York data sets. He was particularly puzzled at NOAA’s treatment of the especially cold winter that ravaged New York in 2013/14, which he describes here: The cold weather really began on Jan 2nd, when an Arctic front descended across much of the country, and extended well into March. The NWS wrote at the end of the winter: The winter of 2013-14 finished as one of the coldest winters in recent memory for New York State. Snowfall across Western and North Central New York was above normal for many areas, and in some locations well above normal. This winter comes on the heels of two previous mild winters, making the cold and snow this winter feel that much harsher. Temperatures this winter finished below normal every month, and the January through March timeframe finished at least 4 degrees below normal for the two primary climate stations of Western New York (Buffalo and Rochester)….. Relentless cold continued through the month of January across the region. So why, he wondered, did NOAA have this marked down as only the 30th coldest winter (since 1895) on its New York State charts, with a mean temperature of 16.9F? Homewood compared the local records for January 1943 and January 2014 – months which, according to NOAA’s charts, had very similar average temperatures. What he found was that NOAA’s charts were deeply inaccurate. The 2014 local temperatures had been adjusted upwards by NOAA and the 1943 local temperatures downwards. He concludes: On average the mean temperatures in Jan 2014 were 2.7F less than in 1943. Yet, according to NOAA, the difference was only 0.9F. Somehow, NOAA has adjusted past temperatures down, relatively, by 1.8F. Now, Homewood has given the same treatment to the most recent Big Freeze – the winter of 2017/2018. Yet again, he has found that NOAA’s arbitrary adjustments tell a lie. They claim that January 2018 was warmer in the New York region than January 1943, when the raw data from local stations tells us this just isn’t true. So at the three sites of Ithaca, Auburn and Geneva, we find that January 2018 was colder than January 1943 by 1.0, 1.7 and 1.3F respectively. Yet NOAA say that the division was 2.1F warmer last month. NOAA’s figure makes last month at least 3.1F warmer in comparison with 1943 than the actual station data warrants. He concludes: Clearly NOAA’s highly homogenised and adjusted version of the Central Lakes temperature record bears no resemblance at all the the actual station data. And if this one division is so badly in error, what confidence can there be that the rest of the US is any better? Well indeed. The key point here is that while NOAA frequently makes these adjustments to the raw data, it has never offered a convincing explanation as to why they are necessary. Nor yet, how exactly their adjusted data provides a more accurate version of the truth than the original data. One excuse NOAA’s apologists make is that weather stations are subject to changing environmental conditions. For example, when the station sited at Syracuse in 1929 was located at what was originally just a sparse aerodrome. Since then, however, as Homewood notes, it has grown into a large international airport with two runways servicing two million passengers a year. Its weather station readings therefore will certainly have been corrupted by the Urban Heat Island effect: that is, its temperature readings will have been artificially elevated by the warmth from the surrounding development and aircraft engines. So you’d think, wouldn’t you, that to compensate for this NOAA would adjust the recent temperatures downwards. Instead, for no obvious reasons, it has adjusted them upwards. This is a scandal. NOAA’s climate gatekeepers are political activists not honest scientists and the U.S. taxpayer has no business funding their propaganda. Drain the swamp!",other
285,"Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide has helped raise global food production and reduce poverty. National polls show that climate change is low on the list of voters’ priorities. For good reason: In the U.S., and for much of the world, the most dangerous environmental pollutants have been cleaned up. U.S. emissions of particulates, metals and varied gases—all of these: ozone, lead, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and sulfur—fell almost 70% between 1970 and 2014. Further reductions will come from improved technologies such as catalytic removal of oxides of nitrogen and more-efficient sulfur scrubbers. This is a boon to human health. But a myth persists that is both unscientific and immoral to perpetuate: that the beneficial gas carbon dioxide ranks among hazardous pollutants. It does not. Unlike genuine pollutants, carbon dioxide (CO2) is an odorless, colorless gas. Every human being exhales about two pounds of CO2 a day, along with a similar amount of water vapor. CO2 is nontoxic to people and animals and is a vital nutrient to plants. It is also a greenhouse gas which helps maintain earth at a habitable temperature. Fear of excessive warming from more CO2 in the atmosphere, including that released from human activity, has caused some people to advocate substantial and expensive reductions in CO2 emissions. But observations, such as those on our CO2 Coalition website, show that increased CO2 levels over the next century will cause modest and beneficial warming—perhaps as much as one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit)—and that this will be an even larger benefit to agriculture than it is now. The costs of emissions regulations, which will be paid by everyone, will be punishingly high and will provide no benefits to most people anywhere in the world.",other
286,"Our NHS is safer in Europe: #NHSsaferIN  14 Jun 2016, by Frances O'Grady in Public services  Today I’m proud to be joining NHS staff and supporters at a rally at Congress House. We’re coming together to say don’t risk a leave vote – Don’t risk our NHS. And there’s a lot to concern us, whether we work in the NHS or rely on it for our families’ health care.  To start with, there’s the potential loss of so many talented NHS staff from the EU. That could unleash a staffing crisis in the NHS.  Where on earth would our NHS be without all the staff who are so dedicated to it: The doctors, nurses and support staff? The NHS staffing roster includes 50,000 staff from the European Economic Area – including 9,000 doctors, 18,000 nurses and midwives, and over 2,000 other health professionals.  These are people who fill crucial skills gaps, and use their incredible knowledge and expertise to help save British lives.  Of course the government should be investing more in training opportunities for locals. Our government’s NHS bursary cuts have been the worst thing possible in dealing with a growing training crisis.  But migrants don’t clog the NHS up – they prop it up.  Yes, our NHS is at breaking point. Staff are over-worked and services are stretched. But that’s not because of decent, hard-working migrants who pay their way. Migrants are often younger people, less likely to need health services than the average UK citizen but still paying UK taxes to support them.  The NHS is in a staffing crisis because the government has imposed another five-year spending freeze. The Tories’ pay cap has created recruitment and retention problems throughout the service, which means more and more taxpayers money is wasted on agencies and management consultants, increasing our deep reliance on EU healthcare staff.  Across the NHS, staff are demoralized – fed up with too little funding to help the patients they care so deeply about, too many top down reorganisations and not enough ministerial respect. And fed up that their dedication is being taken for granted.  The EU’s Working Time Directive means we have rules that protect staff wellbeing, and don’t needlessly risk patient safety. We already have dedicated health staff putting in long hours, but many Brexit leaders want to overturn their rights to refuse excessive working hours and push them to work even longer.  And of course funding for the NHS depends on Britain’s economy doing well. Pretty much everyone agrees leaving the EU will hit the economy even brexiteers admit it would hurt in the short term, and that will put our crisis hit NHS even deeper in trouble.  Based on IFS analysis, if we leave the EU, the public purse is likely to lose enough money each year to fund the whole of NHS England for 3 months.  Of course not all the public spending cuts would fall on the NHS. But it could still be as much as £10 billion a year by the end of the decade. Equivalent to every hospital trust in England cutting 1,000 nurses and 155 doctors.  But the thing that gets me about the discussion of the NHS in this referendum campaign is the hypocrisy. Because when did the leading lights of Brexit ever give a toss about the NHS?  Does anyone really believe that Boris Johnson cares about the NHS? That’s the same Boris Johnson who is on record saying he doesn’t believe in a free NHS; and that if people paid for services, they’d value them more.  Or Michael Gove who co-authored a book saying the NHS is “no longer relevant in the 21st century”? Or Iain Duncan Smith, who has said he’d prefer a social insurance system? Or even Nigel Farage, who believes that within the next ten years the NHS should be replaced by private health insurance?  I don’t believe they support the NHS as we know and love it, any more than I believe they oppose the EU/US TTIP trade deal. If we came out of the EU, these men would sign us up to their own secret trade deals like a shot. We wouldn’t even know about the deals; let alone have the chance to change them.  But perhaps the Leave campaign’s most shameful fib of all is the claim that leaving the EU would mean more money for the NHS. Frankly, I was gobsmacked when I first saw the Leave campaign’s battle bus slogan.  As the Tory MP and former GP Sarah Wollaston said last week, when she defected from leave to remain: “it simply isn’t true”. Even if we trusted them to do the right thing with the cash, the sums simply don’t add up. They’ve been repeatedly slammed for it by the UK’s statistics watchdog.  The leave campaign are fond of saying we remainers are negative. To be honest when faced with a change that could cause such damage it’s hard not to be. But there are also positive reasons to vote Remain for our NHS.  Being in the EU helps make our NHS better. It means a common set of professional standards across the EU. And when you’re away for work or on holiday, British citizens get the right to free healthcare in other member states.  It also means significant funding for research and development into health. Just last year, the UK received £232 million of EU money – incidentally the largest slice of funding received by any EU member state. That included vital money for research at Great Ormond Street children’s hospital, University Hospital Birmingham and NHS Blood and Transplant services. It keeps the NHS at the forefront of healthcare worldwide.  So we have a choice to make. To build our NHS – or risk it. To back our NHS – or privatise it. And to celebrate and cherish NHS staff – or demonise and divide them. A vote to Leave isn’t just a big gamble with jobs, wages and rights, it’s also a big gamble with our NHS.  The NHS was built by and for working people. It is about solidarity, collaboration and co-operation. And it is too special, too precious, to entrust to the privatising Tories and UKIP, who are pushing Brexit as a way towards a deregulated, low-tax and low-services UK.  The NHS needs to be safeguarded if it’s going to be able to care for our children and grandchildren. I’ll be voting remain to do that.",other
287,"Net migration could fall by about 100,000 a year if the UK leaves the EU and introduces work permits for EU citizens, a pressure group has said.  Migration Watch says this would cut net migration - the difference between the number of people arriving and leaving - from 180,000 to 65,000 a year.  But James McGrory, from the pro-EU Britain Stronger In Europe campaign, called the report disingenuous.  He said it was another example of fudging the facts.      Follow the latest updates with BBC Politics Live  The UK is set to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether or not it should remain a member of the European Union.  The report from Migration Watch, which advocates tighter immigration controls, looks at possible policies that could be introduced if the UK voted to leave the EU and considers their impact on overall migration figures. lineimage copyrightNot Specified Analysis The Union Jack flag next to the European Flagimage copyrightReuters image captionThe Conservatives have promised to hold an in/out referendum on the EU by the end of 2017  BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw  No-one knows for sure what impact a British exit from the EU would have on immigration.  It would depend on the terms of a new settlement that might take months to negotiate and years to put into place.  But say, as Migration Watch advocates, that it did herald controls on the flow of low-skilled EU migrant labour, would that really work in reducing net migration?  Wouldn't there be an influx of migrants from the EU before the restrictions came into force?  Wouldn't businesses that currently rely on labourers, chambermaids and supermarket shelf-stackers from Europe demand that they be allowed to recruit them from elsewhere?  And wouldn't the EU introduce work permits for British workers, thereby reducing emigration from the UK?  These are questions that need answers in the months leading up to the referendum. lineimage copyrightNot Specified 'Pressure on services'  The report suggested the key change could be the introduction of work permits which would limit EU nationals entering the country to higher-skilled workers, their family members and students, while low-skilled workers would not be granted entry.  Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch, said: It is time to examine possible alternative immigration regimes.  Under the current arrangements, signs indicated migration to Britain would continue at a substantial rate for the foreseeable future, he said.  Indeed, immigrants tend to generate further migration as their friends and relatives join them in their new countries, he said.  Work permits for EU citizens would substantially reduce net migration and its resultant pressure on our population and public services.  The 16-page paper suggests that on average only about 20% of EU migrants who came to Britain between 2004 and 2014 were doing higher-skilled work.  It said: This could substantially reduce the EU inflow for work to perhaps one fifth of its recent level and would, in turn, substantially reduce net migration by perhaps 100,000 a year from the current level of 180,000. Graph showing long-term international migration to the UK  The figures should not be taken as a precise estimate but were intended to illustrate the scale of the potential reduction under the policy outlined, it said.  There would be no need for restrictions on EU citizens coming to the UK as students or tourists, the authors concluded.  Those who are self-sufficient would also be free to live in Britain, including those who are looking for jobs. 'No evidence'  Under the suggested system there would also be no restriction on EU family members of British citizens coming to join them, while relatives of European skilled workers and students would have the right to live and work in the UK.  Those EU citizens already living and working in the UK would retain their existing rights, Migration Watch suggested.  However, pro-EU campaigner Mr McGrory said: Right now, Britain has the best of both worlds. We have an opt-out from the passport-free Schengen area, while still enjoying full access to the single market.  The Leave campaigns haven't produced a shred of evidence to show how they could guarantee a deal that is at least as good if we left.  The Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said if it became harder for employers to recruit EU workers they may try to bring in more migrants from outside Europe.  Most recent estimated net migration to the UK reached a record 336,000 in the year to June 2015 according to Office for National Statistics ONS figures  ",other
288,"Meghan Markle will use the furore over her interview with Oprah to launch a political career which could take her all the way to the White House, if rumours circulating around Westminster last week turn out to be accurate. One senior Labour figure – a veteran of Tony Blair's Downing Street administration with strong links to Washington – claimed to The Mail on Sunday that Ms Markle, 39, was networking among senior Democrats with a view to building a campaign and fundraising teams for a tilt at the US Presidency. Last night, a source close to the Duchess of Sussex declined to comment, but the couple have made little secret of their political beliefs. One senior Labour figure claimed that Meghan Markle (pictured last year), 39, was networking among senior Democrats with a view to building a campaign and fundraising teams for a tilt at the US Presidency During the US election last year they levelled a thinly veiled attack on Donald Trump by urging voters to 'reject hate speech', which a spokesperson for the couple described as 'a call for decency'. Trump himself declared that he was 'not a fan' of Meghan, 39. A source said: 'The Blairite, internationalist and Democratic party networks are buzzing with talk about Meghan's political ambitions and potential backers.' Last year, a friend of the Duchess told Vanity Fair magazine that one of the reasons she did not give up her American citizenship when she married into the Royal Family was to allow her to keep open the option of entering Washington politics. US constitutional experts responded that she would have to renounce her title if she wanted to hold public office in the States, because it would cut across the US oath of allegiance. Buckingham Palace tried to distance the Royal Family from the remarks made during the US election by issuing a statement saying that 'the Duke is not a working member of the Royal Family' and describing his comments as 'made in a personal capacity'. The source added that the presumption was that the Duchess was eyeing 2024, when President Joe Biden will be 82 and deciding whether he wants to run for a second term. During the US election last year the couple levelled a thinly veiled attack on Donald Trump by urging voters to 'reject hate speech' If she made it to the White House, Meghan would be the first female US President – succeeding where Hillary Clinton narrowly failed four years ago If she made it to the White House, Meghan would be the first female US President – succeeding where Hillary Clinton narrowly failed four years ago – and the second non-white occupant of the Oval Office after Barack Obama. She would also be following in the footsteps of President Ronald Reagan, who was a Hollywood actor for four decades before switching to politics. During the 2020 campaign, the Duchess addressed the When All Women Vote Couch Party, the organisation co-founded by Michelle Obama to encourage participation in elections. Meghan's friends have previously encouraged speculation about her political ambitions – describing her rise from modest beginnings as 'the embodiment of the American dream'.",other
289,"Contractors bidding for work with the government are being asked to affirm that they back Brexit. Liam Fox’s Department for International Trade DIT has inserted a clause into advertisements inviting tech companies to bid for work, saying that in order to have the right “cultural fit” for the task, they must “be committed to the best possible outcome for the United Kingdom following its departure from the European Union”. Pro-Brexit ministers have sometimes been frustrated by civil servants’ lack of enthusiasm for the complex task of unpicking Britain’s close relationship with the EU and appear to be determined to hire firms that share their optimism. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary and prominent leave campaigner, used a speech to the British Chambers of Commerce on Tuesday to condemn “droning and moaning” about the risks of leaving the EU. Last December, contractor Deloitte apologised after details of a damning report it had written about Downing Street’s plans for handling the article 50 process were leaked. The company also agreed to pull out of bidding for government contracts for six months. The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, said: “The Conservative Brexit government demanding there must be a ‘cultural fit’ is straight out of the pages of Nineteen Eighty-Four. “The private opinions of government employees have always been their own business. Now they are required to support Brexit, will they have to support the Tories too?” Farron added: “Professionals will always strive for the best outcomes in their work without being told how they should and shouldn’t think.” The ‘cultural fit’ requirement in two advertisements for short-term digital contracts. Photograph: Gov.uk The “cultural fit” requirement appears in two government advertisements for short-term digital contracts. One invites bids from firms to “investigate the feasibility of designing a system to manage intelligence on market access barriers”; another is for “investigating the feasibility of creating certain services around trade remedies as trade legislation is transferred from the EU to the UK”. As Theresa May prepares to trigger article 50, the two new government departments she set up to oversee the process – DIT and the Department for Exiting the European Union – are both hiring staff and contractors. The requirement to back the best deal for Britain is one of a list of criteria applicants for the two DIT contracts are asked to fulfil, alongside being “focused enough to stick to the task at hand”, “committed and hard-working” and “enthused by the prospect of working at the frontline in such an exciting and dynamic area”. In total, these “cultural fit” criteria will be given a 15% weighting in assessing which company to pick, the ads say. Academics and former senior civil servants have repeatedly warned about the complexity of the task facing politicians in extricating Britain from the EU, with one thinktank, UK in a Changing Europe, warning recently that it could overwhelm the capacities of the state; but these sceptics have often been accused of trying to “block Brexit”. Fox cannot yet draw up new trade deals because the UK will continue to trade under existing arrangements while it remains a member of the EU. But he has been travelling the world in a process his advisers call “pitch-rolling” for new deals that can be signed as soon as possible after Brexit. Article 50 kicks off a two-year process of negotiations with the other 27 EU member states. May has repeatedly said she intends to invoke it before the end of March. A DIT spokesperson said: “Ongoing recruitment is enabling us to build a team from the widest pool of talent in the civil service and externally, across a range of policy and corporate expertise and international experience. “The contract advertised is for a team to design a system to manage intelligence on market access barriers. “They will be required to act with objectivity and impartiality under the civil service code.”",other

292,"A Utah-based left-wing activist is facing criminal charges for allegedly participating in the Capitol Hill riot last week. John Sullivan, who is the founder of Insurgence USA — a social justice group he started after the death of George Floyd — was arrested and charged in federal court in Washington, DC, according to a report by Salt Lake Tribune. An affidavit in support of a criminal complaint and arrest warrant alleges Sullivan “knowingly and willfully joined a crowd of individuals who forcibly entered the U.S. Capitol and impeded, disrupted, and disturbed the orderly conduct of business” by the U.S. House and Senate. While Sullivan claims he attended last week’s “Stop the Steal” march as a journalist, the affidavit signed by FBI Special Agent Matthew Foulger says otherwise. The criminal complaint reads: At various times, Sullivan has claimed to be a journalist. He has admitted, however, that he has no press credentials and the investigation has not revealed any connection between Sullivan and any journalistic organizations. In the affidavit, Foulger goes on to detail videos — that Sullivan provided to the FBI — in which the left-wing activist can allegedly be heard encouraging protesters inside and around the Capitol Building. In one video, Sullivan can be heard — as he approaches the Capitol Building with others — saying, “There are so many people. Let’s go. This shit is ours! Fuck yeah,” “We accomplished this shit. We did this together. Fuck yeah! We are all a part of this history,” and “Let’s burn this shit down.” The affidavit adds that while walking through the Capitol, Sullivan can also be heard saying, “it’s our house motherfuckers,” and “we are getting this shit.” “In at least two encounters, Sullivan can be heard on the video arguing with the officers, telling them to stand down so that they do not get hurt,” reads the criminal complaint. “At one point in the video, Sullivan enters an office within the U.S. Capitol — once inside the office, Sullivan approaches a window — and states, ‘We did this shit. We took this shit.'” the affidavit adds. The criminal complaint goes on to say that at one point, “a knocking noise is heard off-screen. The camera then pans to show more of the window and a broken pane can be seen that was not broken on Sullivan’s approach to the window.” “Sullivan can then be heard saying, ‘I broke it. My bad, my apologies. Well they already broke a window, so, you know, I didn’t know I hit it that hard. No one got that on camera,'” the affidavit continues. “Eventually, individuals in the crowd outside the doors announce that the officers are leaving and ‘giving us the building,'” the affidavit adds. “As the crowd begins to part so the officers can leave, Sullivan can be heard saying, ‘Haul that motherfucker out this bitch.'” At another point in the video, Sullivan is walking down a hallway inside the Capitol Building with a large group of people, and can be heard saying, “Why don’t we go in there” as he pans the camera to a closed door. Then, after someone hits the door, Sullivan can be heard saying, “That’s what I’m sayin’, break that shit.” The affidavit goes on to detail several other examples of Sullivan’s conduct on Capitol Hill that day, adding the activist had also posted some of the videos to social media, under the pseudonym JaydenX. The criminal complaint also notes Sullivan was charged with “Rioting and Criminal Mischief” over the summer by local law enforcement authorities in Provo, Utah. The arrest was in connection with a June protest in which one person was shot and injured. The case is still pending. For his actions on January 6, the left-wing activist faces federal charges of civil disorder, entering a restricted building or grounds, and violent entry or disorderly conduct.",other
293,"A new study from Johns Hopkins on natural immunity to COVID-19 might prove Anthony Fauci's worst nightmare. ""If you had a positive COVID test in the past, then you had a 99.3 percent chance of having circulating antibodies against COVID, and those antibodies were present up to 20 months, nearly two years after the infection,"" explained Dr. Marty Makary on ""Washington Watch."" The antibodies could last longer, but ""that's as long as the infection has been around."" For millions of Americans who have recovered from COVID-19, this is good news. But there couldn't be worse news for Dr. Fauci, or as some believe him to be, Science Incarnate. Since early in the pandemic, the National Institutes of Health have discounted natural immunity because, they said, its duration was unknown. That's the public health equivalent of recommending soldiers not carry guns into combat because they might jam unpredictably. Over a year later, the federally-backed funding behemoth still has never bothered to study the question. ""Why am I doing this study,"" asked Makary, a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine & School of Public Health, ""when the NIH has $42 billion and could have done this study instantly?"" He suggested the answer is, ""they don't want to know the results."" The conclusions of the Johns Hopkins study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, are far from ""fringe."" Israeli data have shown natural immunity to be 27 times more protective than vaccines, but Mr. Science ignored that data, preferring instead to extrapolate a policy decision from other Israeli data, released around the same time, which showed booster shots could reduce the risk of hospitalization for older people. ""You cannot cherry pick the science,"" Makary protested. Makary is concerned with the exclusive club of medical experts who are both advising the Biden administration on policy and controlling the purse strings for scientific grants to allow others to conduct research. ""They just talk among themselves,"" he said. A FOIA request has revealed that in October 2020, Fauci colluded with NIH Director Francis Collins to discredit with ""a quick and devastating published take down"" Stanford epidemiologist Jay Bhattacharya and other authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, who advocated for natural immunity and targeted protection for vulnerable groups. Fauci's ilk ""are living in their own bubble,"" Makary said. ""They're not even thinking about an exit of the pandemic."" To determine U.S. policy on natural immunity, they held a ""small vote among some of their experts... The vote was split, and they decided not to recognize it."" Note that this split vote was the ""scientific consensus"" with which dissenting opinions were so ruthlessly de-platformed, ridiculed, and cancelled in the early months of lockdowns. The self-proclaimed experts knew that Americans wouldn't tolerate lockdowns if their flimsy scientific basis was widely known. ""This should not be an oligarchy,"" argued Makary. ""This should be an open scientific debate."" ""The science is now heavily curated,"" continued Makary. ""The CDC's own study on natural immunity... showed natural immunity was three times more protective [against hospitalization] than vaccinated immunity."" But that's not what their conclusion said. They wrote that ""vaccination is still the safest strategy. But that's not what the data show,"" he said. ""Ten to 20 percent of the U.S. population gets infected with a respiratory infection every year, and has for centuries,"" he concluded. ""That doesn't mean we stop living, doesn't mean we shut down school and cover the faces of kids with cloth masks. It means we use common sense.""

294,"High earners in professional jobs, such as doctors, lawyers and teachers, are much more likely to be regular alcohol drinkers than those on average incomes, according to the latest official figures. The data from two reports shows that people earning more than £40,000 a year like their wine, beer or whisky, and can afford it. Four out of five 79% in England said they had drunk alcohol in the previous week – a question used to measure drinking habits in surveys – compared with 58% of all adults. Drinking rises steadily with socioeconomic status: people whose work is classified as routine and manual, including labourers, receptionists and care workers, were the least likely to have had alcohol in the week before they were asked. The reports come from NHS Digital England only and the Office for National Statistics. The ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey shows that in Great Britain in 2017, an estimated 29.2 million adults said they had drunk alcohol in the week before they were asked. England had the highest proportion of adults who said they drank alcohol in the previous week 57.8%, followed by Scotland 53.5% and then Wales 50.0%; of the English regions, among consumers of alcohol, binge drinking was more common in the north-west and least common in the south-east. How much people drink varies with age. A fifth of people said they did not drink at all. They were most likely to be between 25 and 64. Those most likely to drink were over 65. When the young drink, they are the most likely to binge on Friday and Saturday nights and then not drink for the rest of the week. Data from previous years in the Health Survey for England showed the most harmful drinking was among middle-aged people, who were more likely to drink every day. “Middle-class drinkers are unlikely to pay attention to government health warnings as they may be less likely to get excessively drunk, and can withstand increases in prices,” said Steve Clarke, an alcohol addiction therapy services manager with the Priory Group. “The over-45s particularly are drinking more regularly but not thinking they’re in danger. But they are drinking four, five, six days a week and it all adds up. In 2016-17 [in England] there were 337,000 estimated hospital admissions attributable to alcohol – that’s a jump of 17%, nearly a fifth, on 2006-07,” he said. The data was published on Tuesday, the day Scotland introduces minimum unit pricing after a long fight with the alcohol industry, which challenged its legality in the courts. The ONS findings support other evidence that price is a big factor in people’s drinking habits. Campaigners and experts hope minimum unit pricing will lead people, especially the most vulnerable, to forgo the strongest drinks because they will become more expensive. They are lobbying for England to follow Scotland’s example. “The Westminster government should now follow Scotland’s lead and introduce MUP in England,” said Sir Ian Gilmore, chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, a coalition of more than 50 organisations. “Cheap alcohol is wrecking lives and livelihoods in England as well as Scotland. There are more than 23,000 deaths a year in England linked to alcohol, and many of these come from the poorest and most vulnerable sections of society.” He added: “Minimum unit pricing will save lives, cut crime and benefit the public finances. At the same time, pub prices will be left untouched, and moderate drinkers will barely notice the difference under MUP. “Any delay in implementing MUP in England will only cost lives and lead to unnecessary alcohol-related harm. We urge the Westminster government to act now.” Minimum unit pricing sets the lowest price at which a unit of alcohol can be sold, which in Scotland is now 50p. A pint of beer containing two units will now have to cost at least £1, and a bottle of wine containing nine units will have to cost at least £4.50. But the biggest impact will be on the very strong ciders and other strong alcoholic drinks that have been very cheap and are often bought by alcoholics.",other

Read our privacy notice  Experts said the case could be hugely significant. Aaron Hayward, employment specialist at DJM Solicitors said it was “no surprise” the drivers were taking action after the Uber case.“The explosion of the gig economy means many thousands of workers across the UK are now engaged in temporary, casual work that doesn’t entitle them to paid holiday, minimum wage and other rights, because they are officially classified as ‘contractors’,” he said.  If the drivers are successful, Deliveroo will be the “first app-based employer to recognise a union in the UK. First they must succeed in convincing a tribunal that drivers should be reclassified as employees as opposed to contractors as collective bargaining laws only apply to employees.  “This is an employment case that employers, workers and lawyers alike will be watching with interest. As we move more towards a ‘gig economy’ based on short-term, software-driven casual work, this issue isn’t going to away anytime soon.”  Deliveroo delivers food from thousands of restaurants which do not have their own delivery service such as Pizza Express, Byron and Gourmet Burger Kitchen.  Drivers receive £3.75 per delivery under a new pilot scheme, but some have allege they wait up to an hour for a delivery, meaning their take-home pay is less than minimum wage. This is legal if the workers are self-employed, but many say it amounts to exploitation.

It said it would also guarantee at least £7.50 an hour and petrol for those who continue to participate, following protests by hundreds of riders in London.  A Deliveroo spokeswoman said: “As Deliveroo continues to grow, we are committed to providing great opportunities for UK riders, with the flexible work riders value, and a payment model which is fair, rewarding and better matches riders’ time with our customers’ orders.  “We have been in close and regular contact with our riders throughout the trial and as you would expect we will be writing directly to our riders to inform them of the next steps as the trial comes to an end.  “The feedback so far has been overwhelmingly positive and we welcome the opportunity to further engage with riders, policymakers and the unions as the sharing economy in Britain continues to grow.”  The IWGB is holding a meeting for campaign supporters in King's Cross at 7pm on Tuesday.",other

298,"In July 2021, the Indonesian Food and Drug Monitoring Agency (BPOM) finally granted the Emergency Use Authorization for Ivermectin as the therapeutic drug to cure the Covid-19. This was due to the country’s “worst-case scenario” epidemic at the time according to officials. Indonesia experienced a spike in COVID-19 infection and deaths in July and was struggling to slow the virus transmission due to its high population.  Indonesia is ranked as the world’s fourth most populous country. The Indonesian government on Thursday (July 15) began distributing free medicine and vitamins to self-isolating Covid-19 patients in high-risk areas as the highly transmissible Delta variant of the coronavirus continued to rip through the country, emptying pharmacy shelves. Each package will have seven days worth of therapeutic Covid-19 drugs and vitamins, and will be given to asymptomatic patients as well as those with mild to moderate symptoms including fever and dry cough. The medication for the latter group will require consultation with a doctor and a prescription. Medical facilities are stretched thin, and demand for oxygen and medication has also soared. As scores of people are isolating themselves at home and self-medicating, prices of drugs have shot up in pharmacies and online. The health ministry has since moved to cap the prices of drugs such as favipiravir, remdesivir and ivermectin. Indonesia’s food and drug agency has authorised ivermectin for emergency use against Covid-19, Reuters reported, although the World Health Organisation, as well as European and the US regulators did not recommend its use for Covid-19 patients. After the government authorized the use of Ivermectin for COVID-19 patients, the number of cases significantly plummeted since July. As of October 8, only 20.5% were fully vaccinated and 35.9% got their first dose. One Twitter user posted a comparison between India and Indonesia’s success with Ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19. The Gateway Pundit previously reported the same scenario in Uttar Pradesh, India. The 33 districts in Uttar Pradesh, India have now become free from COVID-19. The recovery rate has increased up to 98.7% proving the effectiveness of IVERMECTIN as part of the “Uttar Pradesh Covid Control Model.” Of course, the media won’t mention that Ivermectin is being used for the treatment of COVID-19.Uttar Pradesh is the leading state in India to use Ivermectin as early and preventatively in all family contacts. And this state is one of the five lowest COVID cases of all states in India despite having only a low vaccination rate.",other
299,"Dr. Vladimir Zelenko became a hero for his early use of hydroxychloroquine to fight COVID. Sadly, his efforts were halted by a Democrat governor. But Dr. Zelenko didn’t stop. He kept working — and found an over-the-counter way to help people. TRENDING: ""For the First Time We Were All Able to Sing the Star-Spangled Banner Together, We Sang it Loud and Proud"" - Exclusive: Patriots Speak Out from the Inside of DC ""GITMO"" - One Year After January 6 Watch: Here is Dr. Zelenko talk about “the bullet and gun” approach for understanding zinc ionophores (transcript of highlights is below): Dr Zelenko: The Gun & The Bullet, Breaking Down The Protocol And Immune Support Here is a transcript of highlights from the video: Dr. Zelenko: “Zinc is the bullet – it kills the virus. The only problem is the bullet doesn’t get to the place where it needs to be. The virus is inside the cell. The enzyme is inside the cell. And the zinc on its own cannot get into the cell. You have a bullet without a gun – useless. Now, it turns out there’s a class of medications called ‘zinc ionophores’ or a class of substances called ‘zinc ionophores’ — what they do — is they open up a channel, a door, which allows zinc to go from outside the cell to inside the cell. There are four of them that are readily available – two of them are prescription and two of them are over-the-counter. The two prescription ones everyone has heard of: Hydroxycholorquine and Ivermection. They’re the guns that shoot the bullet. The bullet then gets into the cell and stops the virus enzyme from helping the virus replicate. So you have a gun and bullet. Only the synergy of the two creates a functioning unit. S in april of last year, Cuomo issued an executive order that was directly targeting me and my patients – because I was the only one in the state doing it. Where pharmacies would not dispense hydroxychloroquine to patients. So all of a sudden, I had a gun and a bullet approach, but…he took away the zinc delivery system — at least he took away access to my patients. So I was forced by necessity to innovate. I did more research, and on the NIH servers of all places, I found papers saying a substance called quercetin is a zinc delivery system, as well. It’s a zinc ionophore. To be honest, I’d never heard of quercetin. So I googled it and I see it’s over-the-counter. That was one of the most significant realizations in my life and probably in humanity. Why do I say that? Because now there was a cure for tyranny. There are two risk factors for dying from COVID: It’s the doctor you choose and the government you live under. Besides that, there’s no reason a person should die from COVID. Now, you don’t need a doctor and now you don’t need permission from the government. You can go to a pharmacy or go to a supermarket and buy an over-the-counter option of quercetin together with Zinc and Vitamin C and Vitamin D. Together it creates a very powerful immune-boosting nutritional supplement. According to the FDA, I’m not allowed to make any claims except that it’s an immune booster and nutritional supplement. So what I’m going to say is the following: Quercetin and Vitamin C together form a functioning zinc ionophore — a zinc delivery system. Zinc is what it delivers, so you actually need zinc as well. You need the gun and the bullet. And Vitamin D – the studies all show – Vitamin D3 levels between 50 and 70 virtually eliminate hospitalizations or admissions in the intensive care unit. It optimizes their immune system..so you need Vitamin D, then you need Zinc, which is the bullet. And then to form a functioning gun, you need Vitamin C and quercetin… Patients were having trouble sourcing it, because it was four different ingredients that weren’t always available in the same place. They had trouble finding the right doses. It was a puzzle that was a little too complex for people to put together. So I was asked as a necessity — as a favor to people — to produce something that has everything in one package. It made sense to me, so with the help of my colleagues, we were able to produce a substance — a compound called Z-Stack — that has Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and most importantly has quercetin and zinc.” Now, Dr. Zelenko is now making Z-Stack available to everyone.
