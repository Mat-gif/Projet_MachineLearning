0,"December 2021 kicked off meteorological winter with a broadly warm – albeit dull – month of weather, during which the UK reached its highest New Year’s Eve temperature on record, with 16.5°C at Bala (north Wales). Maximum temperatures also exceeded 15°C in all four nations. This is according to provisional figures released by the Met Office.  The unusually high temperatures seen on New Year’s Eve coincided with a temperate end to December, resulting in some stations breaking long-standing one-off records for the month. Cromer in Norfolk saw its warmest December day in a 103-year series with 15.4°C recorded on 30th December.  For the complete month, it’s the notably high minimum temperatures recorded in December that stand out from the statistics, especially in southern areas. The UK had an average minimum temperature in December of 2.8°C, which is 1.4°C above the 1991-2020 long-term average; figures that have recently been updated to reflect the latest 30-year meteorological period. The highest average minimum temperature seen in December stands at 5.2°C, set in 2015.  For southern areas, minimum temperatures were even further from the meteorological averages, with southern England seeing average minimum temperatures at 4.3°C, which is 2.0°C above the long-term average for the month. There were some exceptionally mild nights, with overcast conditions and a south-westerly flow drawing air from the Azores. Daily minimum temperatures on New Year’s Eve remained widely in double figures, with several stations including Sheffield, Bradford and Buxton recording their highest daily minimum temperature on record in series of over 100 years – around 10°C higher than the December average.  Average minimum temperatures versus the long term average for December 2021  The often mild, cloudy nights resulted in below average days of frost for the much of the UK. There was an average of just 11.5 days of ground frost reported across the UK in December, well below the long-term average of 16.3 days. The fewest average number of days of ground frost in December was in 2015, with just 5.8 days.  Average number of ground frost days in the UK in December 2021 versus the long term average  Despite the relatively high temperatures, sunshine hours in December 2021 have been in short supply, with an average of just 27.6 hours for the UK, less than one hour per day on average and only around two-thirds of the normal December sunshine total. That’s little enough to make it the dullest December since 1956, when an average of 19.5 hours of sunshine was seen. It was also the UK’s sixth dullest calendar month in records from 1919. England saw 60% (30.6 hours) of its average sunshine, Wales 69% (28.3 hours), Scotland 79% (23.6 hours) and Northern Ireland only 54% (20.7 hours).  The dull but warm conditions have provided an unusual mix for the country’s gardeners. Chief Horticultural Advisor at the Royal Horticultural Society Guy Barter said: “After milder weather and limited frosts so far this winter, greens such as Brussels sprouts and leeks have kept growing and winter flowers such as autumn flowering camellia and Christmas roses have not been spoilt.  “Weeds too have kept growing but with dull conditions they won’t set seeds and can be spared for now to help wildlife. Lawns remain remarkably green but growth has been limited by a lack of light, so the lawnmower can rest a bit longer.”  Sunshine duration for the UK versus the long term average for December  Rainfall was relatively near average for much of the UK, although areas in the northwest generally saw less than their average. Northern Ireland received 113% (136.6mm), whereas Scotland received 79% (136.8mm). The UK had 90% of its average rainfall (115.1mm).  Mike Kendon from the National Climate Information Centre said: “December will largely be remembered for the unseasonable warmth we saw in the middle and end of the month. As a result, we have seen relatively few days of ground frost and air frost and less of the cold weather that you’d normally expect at the start of winter, although some northern spots have seen some hard frosts. There were also remarkable temperature inversion conditions for several days in Scotland where the warmest and sunniest place to be was across the mountain summits.  “This spell of weather in the middle of the month was driven by an established area of high pressure over the UK, keeping temperatures well above average for spells, although low temperatures did take charge in the early part of December.”  December 2021 also saw a white Christmas declared by the Met Office, with a flurry of snow over high ground in the north of the UK.

1,"A ruling by European human rights judges has forced police to warn gangsters that their lives might be in danger - at vast expense to taxpayers. An ex-justice minister last night revealed how senior officers are having to spend time and money issuing the villains and drug lords with 'threat to life notices'. This is despite the fact they are putting themselves in peril through their own actions and it is diverting resources away from protecting 'innocent, law-abiding citizens'. The European Court of Human Rights has decided that not passing on intelligence that another gangster wants to hurt them infringes their right to life. The European Court of Human Rights has decided that not passing on intelligence that another gangster wants to hurt them infringes their right to life meaning police are having to tell them Dominic Raab, who left the Government in July, said the farce had been exposed to him by police as he gathered evidence for a British Bill of Rights He told House magazine: 'One of the things that happened because of Strasbourg – not the European Convention itself, but the judges – is they expanded through mission creep the scope of the Convention without any democratic accountability, to say that if police forces were aware of a risk to someone they must notify them. 'Now, that may be good policy. But turning it into a human right that can be enforced in court is crazy. 'One of the things I learnt as we started to gather evidence for the Bill of Rights, talking to Greater Manchester police, is that they now - as a result of that ruling - have to give tip-offs and notify gangsters who are fighting each other. And that absorbs a huge amount of their time. 'Now I'm not saying you should let gangsters fight it out, but I don't see why police resources – and this was the evidence we heard – should be displaced giving threat to life notices and tipping off gangsters who are engaged in gang warfare with each other, when I would like to see that taxpayer's money and police focus on dealing with and prioritising threats to innocent, law-abiding citizens.' He added: 'It's crazy that the unchecked expansion of human rights means precious police resources are squandered protecting gangsters from each other - rather than prioritised to protect law-abiding citizens.' The revelations will trigger new controversy over the failure by David Cameron's Government to scrap the Human Rights Act or take Britain out of the European Convention on Human Rights. David Cameron promised a decade ago to take firm action to end abuse of human rights law but the plans remained on the drawing board. Proposals by Mr Raab and former justice secretary Michael Gove were shelved as a result of the referendum. The new Justice Secretary, Liz Truss, is now reviewing the plans – with no date fixed for their publication. Prime Minister Theresa May has ruled out leaving the court altogether. She is in favour of full withdrawal but accepted that the plans would not be approved by Parliament. The ruling by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg pictured has forced police to warn gangsters that their lives might be in danger - at vast expense to taxpayers Earlier this month, Mrs Truss told MPs: 'There are changes that could be made but that is really a matter that we need to develop in the proposals that we will be putting forward in due course.' There have been at least 2,000 'threat to life' notices issued by 27 police forces who answered freedom of Information requests in the UK since 2012. The true figure will be far higher as the likes of West Midlands, Merseyside and Greater Manchester did not reply. The letters - also known as Osman warnings - are issued by police if they become aware of a 'real and immediate' threat to somebody's life, but there is not enough evidence to justify the police arresting the possible offender. They are named after Ali Osman, who was murdered by Paul Paget-Lewis, a teacher at his son's school, in 1988. Paget-Lewis formed a 'disturbing' attachment to Mr Osman's 14-year-old son Ahmet, then 14, and at one point told police he was considering committing a massacre. In March 1988, he stole a gun, killed Mr Osman and shot and seriously injured Ahmet. The Osman family successfully argued in the European Court of Human Rights that the Metropolitan Police had breached Mr Osman's right to life because it had all the information it needed to deal with the threat. The National Police Chiefs Council insists that Osman warnings have proved 'highly effective in the overwhelming majority of cases.'",true/false,

Commission vice president Frans Timmermans urged EU member states to do more “urgently” – warning once more that the future of the passport-free Schengen zone was at risk.  He said: “We can only effectively manage asylum and migration in Europe, and preserve the Schengen area, if we all work together in a spirit of solidarity and responsibility.”",true/false,
3,"Though these types of floods often produce only a foot or two of standing saltwater, they are straining life in many towns by killing lawns and trees, blocking neighborhood streets and clogging storm drains, polluting supplies of freshwater and sometimes stranding entire island communities for hours by overtopping the roads that tie them to the mainland.  Such events are just an early harbinger of the coming damage, the new research suggests.  “I think we need a new way to think about most coastal flooding,” said Benjamin H. Strauss, the primary author of one of two related studies released on Monday. “It’s not the tide. It’s not the wind. It’s us. That’s true for most of the coastal floods we now experience.”  In the second study, scientists reconstructed the level of the sea over time and confirmed that it is most likely rising faster than at any point in 28 centuries, with the rate of increase growing sharply over the past century — largely, they found, because of the warming that scientists have said is almost certainly caused by human emissions.  They also confirmed previous forecasts that if emissions were to continue at a high rate over the next few decades, the ocean could rise as much as three or four feet by 2100.  Experts say the situation would then grow far worse in the 22nd century and beyond, likely requiring the abandonment of many coastal cities.",true/false,

5,"Volcano Watch is a weekly article and activity update written by U.S. Geological Survey Hawaiian Volcano Observatory scientists and affiliates.  Sources/Usage: Public Domain. La Palma is a basaltic shield volcano in the Canary Islands. Like Hawaiian volcanoes, La Palma typically erupts lava flows. This aerial photo, courtesy of Radio Televisión Canaria, shows lava flows that are being generated by a fissure eruption upslope on La Palma. One of the lava flows is entering the ocean, creating new land called a lava delta. Lava deltas are built by the accumulation of lava near the base of the sea cliff at an ocean entry.  “Volcano Watchers” are probably aware that an eruption began on La Palma in the Canary Islands on September 19. The eruption style is similar to Hawaiian eruptions, and both locations share the potential for flank collapse and tsunami.  Basaltic ocean islands, such as the Island of Hawai‘i and the Canary Islands, tend to experience catastrophic landslides every few hundred thousand years—a discovery first made by USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory Scientist-in-Charge Jim Moore in the early 1960s! A significant portion of an island is removed during collapse and has the potential to displace tremendous amounts of seawater, generating local tsunami waves that are thought to be over 100 meters (300 feet) high. From this understanding grew a notion that collapsing volcanoes—particularly in the Canary Islands—could generate ocean-wide “mega-tsunami.”  In 2001, an academic paper suggested that collapse of La Palma could result in tsunami waves up to 25 m (about 80 feet) high along the east coasts of North and South America. This scenario made headlines in the media, which inaccurately depicted a huge wave devastating New York City.  But can collapses actually generate these “mega-tsunami” far from their sources? Subsequent research casts doubt on this idea.  The Canary Islands “mega-tsunami” scenario assumed a single, coherent, massive collapse block that reached a high velocity very quickly. Ocean floor mapping surrounding the Canary Islands, however, indicates that collapses instead occur in incremental or piecemeal fashion. In addition, geomorphologists found, via slope stability analysis, that the potential collapse volume is much smaller than was simulated by the 2001 paper.  Tsunami modeling has also advanced considerably since 2001. Studies of landslide-induced waves show that they travel at different speeds and interact more across long distances, leading to smaller wave height far from their sources. Better knowledge of ocean bathymetry, island and coastal topography, and the transfer of energy between slide blocks and water also contributed to more accurate modeling.  These new simulations suggest that the maximum wave height along the east coast of the Americas from a “worst-case scenario” collapse of La Palma would be on the order of 1-2 m (3-7 feet)—still hazardous, but similar to common storm surge.  A lack of geologic evidence also calls the “mega-tsunami” hypothesis into question. Tsunami leave characteristic sediment deposits on the coastlines they impact. But no such deposit has ever been identified on the east coasts of North and South America.  Collapses of Canary Island volcanoes are rare, occurring on timescales of hundreds of thousands of years, and should be preceded by signs of flank instability: increases in earthquakes and ground surface deformation. Canary Island volcanoes also erupt regularly—La Palma last erupted in 1971 and 1949—and slope stability analyses conducted at La Palma indicate that the structure is stable. The volcano would have to grow significantly before a collapse was likely.  This abundant evidence refutes the “mega-tsunami” hypothesis, demonstrating that it does not hold up to rigorous examination. However, tsunami that are generated by volcanoes are a real process and a significant threat. For example, the 1883 explosive eruption of Krakatau, in Indonesia, caused a local tsunami that killed tens of thousands on nearby coastlines. In 2018, a smaller eruption and collapse of Anak Krakatau, an island which grew in the 1883 caldera, also resulted in a local tsunami that killed hundreds.  Local tsunami can also be generated by other volcanic processes. On the Island of Hawai‘i, lava delta collapse at lava-ocean entries can cause small tsunami that impact areas adjacent to the delta. Slip on the fault underlying Kīlauea’s south flank, associated with M7–8 earthquakes, caused local tsunami in 1868 and 1975 that took lives. These are processes that have happened repeatedly in human history; they will happen again, and their associated hazards deserve our attention.  While the scientific view of the “mega-tsunami” hypothesis has evolved in the years since 2001, that original work led others to start investigations that contributed new knowledge that advanced our understanding of landslides and tsunami generated by volcanoes. In this way, the story is a marvelous example of exactly how science happens!  Volcano Activity Updates  Kīlauea volcano is erupting. Its USGS Volcano Alert level is at WATCH (https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/volcano-hazards/about-alert-levels). Kīlauea updates are issued daily.  Lava continues to erupt from a single vent in the western wall of Halemaʻumaʻu crater. All lava activity is confined within Halemaʻumaʻu crater in Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park. Sulfur dioxide emission rates remain high and were estimated at around 2,700 tonnes per day on Oct. 17, 2021. Seismicity is elevated but stable, with few earthquakes and ongoing volcanic tremor. Summit tiltmeters have remained relatively flat over the past week. For more information on the current eruption of Kīlauea, see Recent Eruption (usgs.gov).  Mauna Loa is not erupting and remains at Volcano Alert Level ADVISORY. This alert level does not mean that an eruption is imminent or that progression to an eruption from the current level of unrest is certain. Mauna Loa updates are issued weekly.  This past week, about 114 small-magnitude earthquakes were recorded below the summit and upper elevation flanks of Mauna Loa—the majority of these occurred at shallow depths less than 10 kilometers (6 miles). Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements show no major deformation over the past week. Gas concentrations and fumarole temperatures at both the summit and at Sulphur Cone on the Southwest Rift Zone remain stable. Webcams show no changes to the landscape.

6,"Pope Francis launches a powerful appeal for people to get vaccinated with approved Covid-19 vaccines, calling it “an act of love.”  By Devin Watkins  The Pope has joined his voice to those of Bishops across North and South America to urge people to get jabbed against Covid-19.  In a video message produced in conjunction with the Ad Council, Pope Francis praised the work of researchers and scientists in producing safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines.  “Thanks to God’s grace and to the work of many, we now have vaccines to protect us from Covid-19,” he said in the video released on Wednesday.  He added that vaccines “bring hope to end the pandemic, but only if they are available to all and if we collaborate with one another.”  Vaccination is an act of love  Pope Francis went on to say that getting a Covid jab that is “authorized by the respective authorities” is an “act of love.”  Helping other do the same, he said, is also an act of love. “Love for oneself, love for our families and friends, and love for all peoples. Love is also social and political.”  The Pope noted that social and political love is built up through “small, individual gestures capable of transforming and improving societies.”  “Getting vaccinated is a simple yet profound way to care for one another, especially the most vulnerable,” he said.  Pope Francis then prayed to God that “each one of us can make his or her own small gesture of love.”  “No matter how small, love is always grand,” he said. “Small gestures for a better future.”  Listen to our report  ‘Strength of faith’  The Pope was joined in the video by several Cardinals and Archbishops from across the Americas.  Archbishop Jose Gomez, president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Archbishop of Los Angeles, lamented the suffering and death the pandemic has wrought across the globe.  He prayed that God might “grant us the grace to face it with the strength of faith, ensuring that vaccines are available for all, so that we can all get immunized.”  Mexican Cardinal Carlos Aguiar Retes linked Covid-19 jabs to a better future for all.  “From North to South America, we support vaccinations for all,” said the Cardinal.  Safe, effective vaccines  Honduran Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga said the world has much to learn from the coronavirus.  “But one thing is certain: the authorized vaccines are effective, and are here to save lives,” he said. “They are the key to a path of personal and universal healing.”  Brazilian Cardinal Claudio Hummes praised the “heroic efforts” of health professionals in developing “safe and effective” jabs.  He also repeated the Pope’s affirmation that “getting vaccinated is an act of love”.  Salvadorian Cardinal Gregorio Rosa Chavez said vaccination helps protect the most vulnerable.  “Our choice to get vaccinated affects others,” he said, adding that it is a moral responsibility.  Unity across the Americas  Peruvian Archbishop Miguel Cabrejos rounded out the testimonies contained in the video with an appeal to unity.  “We are united—North, Central, and South America and the Caribbean—to promote and support vaccination for all,” he said, encouraging everyone to “act responsibly, as members of the great human family, seeking and protecting our integral health and universal vaccination.”",true/false,
7,"The United States is witnessing a massive, dangerous heat wave, as a huge system of high pressure covers the central part of the country. It’s a big enough deal that yesterday President Obama even tweeted about it, including a map showing the maximum heat index in some parts of the Midwest and Southeast reaching 110 or 115 degrees on Saturday. Here in Washington, temperatures could break 100 degrees Friday or over the weekend.   This will, inevitably, lead to much talk of climate change in the coming days. So it’s important to separate the scientific wheat from the chaff and figure out what science can, and can’t, reliably say about the link between an event like this and a warming planet — especially in a year that, on a global scale, has shattered past temperature records for six out of the last six months. And the gist is that when it comes to extreme heat waves in general — heat waves that appear out of the norm in some way, for instance in their intensity, frequency, or duration — while scientists never say individual events are “caused” by climate change, they are getting less and less circumspect about making some connection. “As predictable as the sunrise, some will say heat waves always happened,” said Marshall Shepherd, director of the atmospheric sciences program at the University of Georgia and former president of the American Meteorological Society. “Yep, so did home runs in baseball, but the steroid era brought more and longer home runs. A new National Academies study suggests that ‘heat waves’ may be one of the primary climate change markers like home runs were in baseball.” In other words, when a planet warms, the odds shift in favor of more intense or long lasting heat waves. That’s just plain logic. Indeed, the National Academy of Sciences report in question notes that, “Confidence in attribution findings of anthropogenic influence is greatest for those extreme events that are related to an aspect of temperature, such as the observed long-term warming of the region or global climate, where there is little doubt that human activities have caused an observed change.” “In particular, for extreme heat and cold events, changes in long-term mean conditions provide a basis for expecting that there should also be changes in extreme conditions.” And we’ve definitely already had changes in not only “long-term mean conditions,” but in heat waves themselves. The U.S. National Climate Assessment found that U.S. heat waves have already “become more frequent and intense,” that the U.S. is shattering high temperature records far more frequently than it is shattering low temperature records (just as you’d expect), and that it is seeing correspondingly fewer cold spells. As for future projections, meanwhile, the assessment added that “Climate models project that the same summertime temperatures that ranked among the hottest 5% in 1950-1979 will occur at least 70% of the time by 2035-2064 in the U.S. if global emissions of heat-trapping gases continue to grow.” However, pointing all of this out is not the same as making a specific attribution for this specific heat event — rather, it is saying that attribution can be made for this class or type of event. Beyond that, specific attribution requires active research, and an attention to the actual temperatures, duration and other aspects of the weather phenomenon. That’s because, as Shepherd notes, there are always heat waves, even in a stable climate. Typically, in such an attribution study, scientists will use sets of climate models — one set including the factors that drive human global warming and the other including purely “natural” factors — and see if an event like the one in question is more likely to occur in the first set of models. Researchers are getting better and better at performing these kinds of studies fast, in near real time. So don’t be at all surprised if we see such a study for the current heat wave event — just as we saw for, most recently, the devastating bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, which was tied to an extreme marine heatwave off Australia’s northeastern coast. But in the meantime, some scientists and experts aren’t holding back. With every heat wave, probably the number one question is, is it climate change, or is it not? Well the answer is, it’s both,” said Texas Tech University climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe on a press call Thursday. “We get heat waves naturally, but climate change is amping them up, it’s giving them that extra energy, to make them even more serious, and have even greater impacts.” Hayhoe didn’t attempt a specific attribution of the current heat wave, any more than Shepherd did. Rather, she’s once again articulating the general connection. “We are not used to having heat waves that are extreme as the ones we see today,” she said. It’s important to underscore, as Hayhoe did, that this event poses severe risks to health — particularly for children and the elderly — and also to crops across the U.S. heartland. She pointed to an extreme 2003 heat wave that affected Paris and Europe, and which has indeed been connected to climate change through statistical attribution analysis. That event killed hundreds of people in Paris and London, and a recent study attributed at least some of those deaths, themselves, to climate change. So these links are real, if not always simple to characterize. Now, it’s all about watching this current event carefully, taking preparations, and seeing what scientists have to say once they run their analyses.",true/false,
8,"The construction of a radiation-free house at Brainport Smart District will start next year. Students of the Eindhoven University of Technology have been looking for an optimal combination of materials and building constructions to allow as little radiation as possible into the house. Some people suffer from electromagnetic radiation, which manifests itself for example in headaches or sleeping problems. They themselves often do not have devices that cause radiation and this house also reduces the radiation from outside. Kendal Varolgunes, architecture student and team leader of the student team Layer, emphasizes that the students are mainly concerned with the architectural aspects of the house. “We’re not investigating to what extent the radiation is harmful to people, that’s up to medical specialists,” he says. A study by the European Economic and Social Committee shows that three to five percent of Europeans are sensitive to radiation. That amounts to about 13 million people. However, it is not scientifically proven that the complaints people experience are actually from electromagnetic radiation. Varolgunes expects that in the future people, with or without complaints, will become more aware of the amount of radiation in their homes and that they want a solution for this. “We see that in other countries standards have already been drawn up about the permissible amount of radiation in a house. Just as there are noise standards,” he explains. “This is not yet the case in the Netherlands. That’s why we’re going to investigate this.” Subscribe to IO on Telegram!

Tiny houses The first radiation-free house on the Brainport Smart District will be a kind of tiny house. “That’s an ideal form for this application,” says Varolgunes. The architecture student explains that it is sometimes difficult for families if a family member is radiation sensitive. “For example, they can’t handle telephones and the wifi router, while others just want to watch Netflix. The students designed the houses in such a way that they can then connect several tiny houses to each other. “That way, everyone has their own space and altogether it’s one house after all.” The students have worked out a so-called prefab concept. Parts of the house are already being produced elsewhere so that the houses can be built and demolished very quickly. “In the first house we want to do a lot of tests, for example, to see how the radiation density of materials changes over time,” says Varolgunes. Prior to the concept development, they also tested the materials and possible structures of the house extensively. “But in practice, it turns out differently. So it’s good to keep measuring,” he says. Recently he also had contact with someone who is sensitive to radiation. “If it all works out financially, she will live in the first house,” he says. Renovation package Besides the complete houses, the students also want to look at renovation packages to make an existing house radiation-proof. “This could be used by construction companies or the government to help their customers and residents,” explains the team leader. With their house, the students want to help the government set standards around radiation. “Not only do we think it’s important to do research and give advice, but we also want to show that it actually works,” he says. “From the university, we can contribute to both elements.” In the coming period, he wants to further develop the house as a not-for-profit student team. “As long as we are connected to the university, we can make use of the facilities, the available knowledge, and the large network. That is very valuable at this stage,” says Varolgunes. “In the future, we may be able to set up a start-up to bring the prefab houses and renovation packages to the market.” Main picture: A model of the radiation-free house. © Team Layer",true/false,
9,"Pediatricians involved in the trials say they are mystified by the onslaught. While powerful drugs do have side effects, many said, they remembered no fatal reactions. At Incarnation, Dr. Nicholas said, no child had died of a reaction and ""no child ever had an unexpected side effect.""  He said that, with one exception, no children had been included in the trials without ""absolute proof"" by advanced testing methods that they were infected and not simply carrying their mother's antibodies. He said the exception was a trial that proved that by giving AZT to pregnant, infected women and then to their newborns in the first six weeks of life it was possible to sharply reduce the rate of H.I.V. transmission from mother to child. He called that study ""the most important clinical trial in the history of AIDS.""  In response to the charge by some critics that hospitals should have appointed independent guardians for each child, doctors said the federal regulations require advocates only when a trial holds ""no prospect of direct benefit"" for the child. Several said their hospitals appointed advocates anyway.  ""This isn't Tuskegee, it never was Tuskegee, it never will be Tuskegee,"" Dr. Borkowsky said. ""This is something that has been blown totally out of proportion by, I think, people who are vying for office and looking for something to get them into the news.""  Columbia University Medical Center, which was found by federal officials to have ""failed to have obtain sufficient information"" in approving the participation of foster children in four trials, has acknowledged what it called a need to improve ""how information is collected and decisions documented."" But it said investigators had not questioned the appropriateness of enrolling children, the care they received, the research's value or the scientists' conduct.  As for the city's child services agency, officials say that in all the years since the drug trials, no family has sued or come to them with evidence of mistreatment. Staff members, past and present, expressed pride in what they had done; the worst thing that could have happened, they said, would have been for the agency to have done nothing.  Mr. Mattingly, the agency's commissioner, said, ""I would far rather be having this dialogue than one in which we tried to explain why my predecessors -- confronted by a medical epidemic of unforeseen magnitude -- did not do everything possible to get these children access to promising medication because they were in foster care. Or because the rules and regulations designed to protect their interests were so complicated that no children got the lifesaving help.""",true/false,
10,"Ever since finding that soft tissue can preserve in dinosaur fossils, paleontologist Mary Schweitzer has been asked the “Jurassic Park” question – will we ever be able to find original dinosaur DNA? And if so, could we someday recreate these awesome animals?  The answers to these questions can get pretty complicated, so Dr. Schweitzer has offered to help us understand what we currently do know about dinosaur DNA, and what may be possible.  Can we get DNA from fossils?  The question should be, “Can we get dinosaur DNA?” Bone is made up of hydroxyapatite mineral. This mineral has such a strong affinity for DNA and many proteins that it is used in modern labs sometimes to purify these molecules. Because this dinosaur bone has been sitting in the ground for 65 million years, the likelihood is high that if DNA were actively sought, it could be found, just because certain biomolecules, including DNA, stick like Velcro to the mineral. However, the challenge isn’t necessarily in finding DNA, it’s in making a strong case that the DNA is dinosaurian in origin by ruling out other sources. Is it possible that we may someday recover authentic DNA from dinosaur bone? The scientific answer is “yes”…..all things are possible until disproven. Have we disproven this possibility? No. Have we recovered “authentic” dinosaur DNA? No. Therefore, it is an open question.  How long can DNA last in the fossil record, and how can we tell for certain that it is dinosaurian, and not a modern lab contaminant or DNA that has leached in from the environment?  Scientists have proposed that DNA has a pretty short shelf-life, most saying that it is unlikely to persist as long as a million years, and surely not more than five or six million years at the most. That sort of leaves out the possibility that we will ever obtain it from dinosaurs that last walked the earth over 65 million years ago! But how did they get this number?  Some have studied DNA degradation by placing molecules of known length and composition into hot acid, and monitoring how long it takes to fall apart. They use heat and acidity as proxies for time, and declare that DNA falls apart quite rapidly. One study set out to recover DNA from progressively older fossils—from a few hundred years old, to about 8,000 years. They found that the amount of recoverable DNA declined with age, and they used this to model a ‘rate of decay.’ They then predicted, but did not test, that DNA as small as 175 base pairs was extremely unlikely to persist in Cretaceous bone. Oddly, this same study showed that age alone could not account for DNA loss or preservation.  On the other hand, we have used 4 different lines of evidence to suggest that a molecule chemically similar to DNA localizes to bone-forming cells in our bone, and is consistent with what we might expect to find, if it were dinosaurian. So, how do we tell if DNA recovered from bone is truly dinosaurian, and not contaminant?  The idea that DNA can persist that long is a long shot at best, so anyone claiming to find/recover dinosaur DNA has to meet the most stringent of criteria. We suggest the following:  DNA sequences recovered from bone should match what we would expect from other data. For example, there are over 300 characters that link dinosaurs to birds, and strongly suggest that the origin of birds lies within theropod (meat-eating) dinosaurs. So, DNA sequences obtained from dinosaurs should also follow that pattern, being more similar to bird DNA than to crocodile DNA, but clearly a little bit different from either so they can be confidently differentiated from modern sources. If DNA is original, it is likely to be highly fragmented, and difficult to analyze by our current methods, developed to sequence happy healthy DNA. If “T. rex DNA” comes in long pieces that are relatively easy to sequence, it is likely to be a contaminant. DNA is proposed to be fragile, relative to other molecules. So, if authentic DNA is present, other, more durable molecules should also be present. DNA sequence from dinosaur bone should always be accompanied by evidence, including sequences, for the persistence of other molecules that are known to be decay resistant while in bone—collagen protein, for example. If one can show DNA that is similar in sequence to avian and crocodilian DNA, and can also show collagen sequences that point to a similar evolutionary relationship, the case for “real” dinosaur DNA goes up. One should also be able to demonstrate the persistence of lipids that make up cell membranes, for example. Lipids are more resistant overall than either protein or DNA. IF DNA and proteins are shown to persist, other methods than sequence should also support this conclusion. For example, binding of proteins to specific antibodies can be used to show that protein signal is localized to the tissues, and not present in surrounding sediments. In our studies, we were able to localize a substance chemically similar to DNA inside the bone cells recovered from this T. rex, using both DNA specific stains, and antibodies to proteins associated with vertebrate DNA. Finally, and probably most importantly, for all steps of any test, adequate controls should be employed. Samples that yield DNA should be co-extracted with the sediments that surrounded the fossil, and also, all buffers and chemicals used in the lab should also be treated to the exact same conditions as the fossil bone. If these also contain the sequences of interest, then it is most likely a contaminant.  So will we ever be able to clone a dinosaur?  In one sense, cloning as is usually done in the lab involves taking a known fragment of DNA, inserting it into a bacterial plasmid, and letting that fragment of DNA replicate over and over each time the cell divides. This results in many, many copies of identical DNA from the insert–clones. In the second case, cloning involves taking the whole complement of DNA from cells within a tissue, and inserting it into viable cells from which the native nuclear material has been removed. This cell is then inserted into a host, and the donor DNA dictates the formation and development of the offspring, which are genetically identical to the donor—i.e., clones. Dolly the sheep is an example of this. When people refer to “cloning a dinosaur,” they usually mean something along these lines. However, this is an incredibly complex process, and despite the unscientific nature of it, the likelihood that we would ever be able to overcome all of the obstacles between fragments of DNA in a dinosaur bone and producing a living offspring is so incredibly small it would rank a “not possible” in my book.  But just because the likelihood of visiting a “real” Jurassic Park is miniscule it doesn’t mean that it is impossible to recover original DNA or other molecules from ancient remains. In fact, these ancient molecules have much to tell us.  Because all evolutionary change must first occur in genes (and the proteins they encode), molecules can directly inform us of evolutionary processes. We can also learn about the durability of molecules under naturally occurring conditions more directly than using lab proxies, such as heat, to estimate rates of molecular degradation. Finally, recovering molecules from fossils, including dinosaurs, yields important information on the origin and distribution of evolutionary novelties, like feathers.  We still have a lot to learn in the molecular analysis of fossils, and we should proceed with the utmost caution, never overstating the data we obtain. But there is so much we can learn from molecules preserved in fossils that we believe it is worth the effort.",true/false,

He was 84. (AP Photo/Marcy Nighswander, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Colin Powell, the trailblazing soldier and diplomat whose sterling reputation of service to Republican and Democratic presidents was stained by his faulty claims to justify the 2003 U.S. war in Iraq, died Monday of COVID-19 complications. He was 84.  A veteran of the Vietnam War, Powell spent 35 years in the Army and rose to the rank of four-star general before becoming the first Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. His oversight of the U.S. invasion of Kuwait to oust the Iraqi army in 1991 made him a household name, prompting speculation for nearly a decade that he might run for president, a course he ultimately decided against.  He instead joined President George W. Bush’s administration in 2001 as secretary of state, the first Black person to represent the U.S. government on the world stage. Powell’s tenure, however, was marred by his 2003 address to the United Nations Security Council in which he cited faulty information to claim that Saddam Hussein had secretly stashed weapons of mass destruction. Such weapons never materialized, and though the Iraqi leader was removed, the war devolved into years of military and humanitarian losses.  Powell was fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, his family said. But he faced several ailments, telling Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward over the summer that he had Parkinson’s disease. Powell’s longtime aide, Peggy Cifrino, said Monday that he was also treated over the past few years for multiple myeloma, a blood cancer that impairs the body’s ability to fight infection. Studies have shown that those cancer patients don’t get as much protection from the COVID-19 vaccines as healthier people.  In a Washington where partisan divisions run deep, Democrats and Republicans recalled Powell fondly. Flags were ordered lowered at government buildings, including the White House, Pentagon and State Department.  President Joe Biden said Powell “embodied the highest ideals of both warrior and diplomat.”  Noting Powell’s rise from a childhood in a fraying New York City neighborhood, Biden said: “He believed in the promise of America because he lived it. And he devoted much of his life to making that promise a reality for so many others.”  Powell’s time as secretary of state was largely defined by the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. He was the first American official to publicly blame Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaida network. He made a lightning trip to Pakistan to demand that then-Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf cooperate with the United States in going after the Afghanistan-based group, which also had a presence in Pakistan, where bin Laden was later killed.  But as the push for war in Iraq deepened, Powell sometimes found himself at odds with other key figures in the Bush administration, including Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Rumsfeld also died this year.  Powell’s State Department was dubious of the military and intelligence communities’ conviction that Saddam possessed or was developing weapons of mass destruction. But he presented the administration’s case that Saddam posed a major regional and global threat in a strong speech to the U.N. Security Council in February 2003. The following month, Bush gave the go-ahead for the invasion.  The U.N. speech, complete with Powell’s display of a vial of what he said could have been a biological weapon, was seen as a low point in his career, although he had removed some elements from the remarks that he deemed to have been based on poor intelligence assessments.  The U.S. overthrow of Saddam ended the rule of a brutal dictator. But the power vacuum and lawlessness that followed unleashed years of sectarian fighting and chaos that killed countless Iraqi civilians, sparked a lengthy insurgency, and unintentionally tilted the balance of power in the Middle East toward a U.S. rival, Iran. No Iraqi weapons of mass destruction were ever found.  Still, Powell maintained in a 2012 interview with The Associated Press that on balance, the U.S. succeeded in Iraq.  “I think we had a lot of successes,” he said. “Iraq’s terrible dictator is gone.”  Saddam was captured by U.S. forces while hiding out in northern Iraq in December 2003 and was later executed by the Iraqi government. But the war dragged on. President Barack Obama pulled U.S. troops out of Iraq in 2011, but he sent advisers back in 2014 after the Islamic State group swept into the country from Syria and captured large swaths of territory.  Bush said Monday that he and former first lady Laura Bush were “deeply saddened” by Powell’s death.  “He was a great public servant” and “widely respected at home and abroad,” Bush said. “And most important, Colin was a family man and a friend. Laura and I send Alma and their children our sincere condolences as they remember the life of a great man.”  Condoleezza Rice, Powell’s successor at State and the department’s first Black female secretary, praised him as “a trusted colleague and a dear friend through some very challenging times.”  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, a retired Army general and the first Black Pentagon chief, said the news of Powell’s death left “a hole in my heart.”  “The world lost one of the greatest leaders that we have ever witnessed,” Austin said while traveling in Europe.  Vice President Kamala Harris, the highest ranking Black woman in U.S. history, also noted Powell’s racial firsts.  “Every step of the way, when he filled those roles, he was by everything that he did and the way he did it, inspiring so many people,” she said. “Young servicemembers and others not only within the military, but in our nation and around the globe, took notice of what his accomplishments meant as a reflection of who we are as a nation.”  No child of privilege, Powell often framed his biography as an American success story.  “Mine is the story of a black kid of no early promise from an immigrant family of limited means who was raised in the South Bronx,” he wrote in his 1995 autobiography “My American Journey.”  It’s an experience he was fond of recalling later in his life. When he appeared at the United Nations, even during his Iraq speech, he often reminisced about his childhood in New York City, where he grew up the child of Jamaican immigrants and got one of his first jobs at the Pepsi-Cola bottling plant directly across the East River from the U.N. headquarters.  Powell’s path toward the military began at City College, where discovered the ROTC. When he put on his first uniform, he wrote, “I liked what I saw.”  He joined the Army and in 1962 he was one of more than 16,000 military advisers sent to South Vietnam by President John F. Kennedy. A series of promotions led to the Pentagon and assignment as a military assistant to Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, who became his unofficial sponsor. He later became commander of the Army’s 5th Corps in Germany and later was national security assistant to President Ronald Reagan.  During his term as Joint Chiefs chairman, his approach to war became known as the Powell Doctrine, which held that the United States should only commit forces in a conflict if it has clear and achievable objectives with public support, sufficient firepower and a strategy for ending the war.  Though he gained national prominence under Republican presidents, Powell ultimately moved away from the party.  He endorsed Democrats in the past four presidential elections, starting with Obama. He emerged as a vocal Donald Trump critic in recent years, describing Trump as “a national disgrace” who should have been removed from office through impeachment.  ___  Associated Press writer Steve Peoples and AP Medical Writer Lauran Neergaard contributed to this report.",true/false,
12,"ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, DUSAN STANKOVIC  When SARS-CoV-2 first began spreading across the globe, not every lab was equipped to study it directly. The virus behind the current pandemic is highly pathogenic and transmissible, leading the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to require many of the same biosafety guidelines that shape the study of diseases such as tuberculosis and Ebola.  As in many moments throughout the last year, the scientific community responded by creatively adapting existing tools to the study of COVID-19. Among these, researchers turned to models of the pathogen such as pseudoviruses and chimeric viruses that can be studied safely in labs with lower biosafety level (BSL) clearance than required for studying the wildtype version, in an effort to expand the study of the novel coronavirus. Pseudoviruses don’t replicate, rendering them harmless, but by replacing their surface envelope proteins with those of SARS-CoV-2, researchers can glean insights into the ways the pathogen infects cells. A chimeric virus is made by inserting the genetic material of one virus into the genome of another, safe surrogate, and these introduced sequences are passed on when the virus replicates.  In addition to their safety, pseudoviruses are “extremely versatile in that you can . . . introduce different envelope proteins and you can introduce mutations, which is making it extremely useful for us to screen a lot of different variants,” says Carol Weiss, a virologist who heads the laboratory of immunoregulation at the US Food and Drug Administration. “If you want to introduce mutations in real viruses, it’s a whole lot more work.”  An approximation of the real thing  Pseudoviruses were first developed in the 1960s, after scientists began studying a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) isolated from cattle. In addition to replicating well in culture, they later learned that its surface protein, VSV-G, facilitates entry into all eukaryotic cells, making the virus a useful vector not only as a pseudovirus but as a ferry to deliver DNA into cells for therapeutic purposes. The first Ebola vaccine was developed using a VSV platform, and more recently, the virus has been engineered to seek out and destroy cancer cells.  HIV-based platforms, which came about in the 1980s, have since replaced VSV as the most common model for developing both pseudo- and chimeric viruses. Unlike VSV’s negative-strand RNA genome that must be transcribed once inside the cell, HIV’s positive-strand RNA genome can instantly begin translation, making pseudoviruses based on HIV faster to produce. HIV-based model viruses have now been used in many of the same applications as VSV, with scientists applying them to the study of diseases such as AIDS, SARS, MERS, and influenza.  We wanted to really validate that the tool that we generated did appear exactly, with everything we could throw at it, the same way as SARS-CoV-2. —Sean Whelan, Washington University  To harness these surrogates to study SARS-CoV-2, researchers first needed to prove that their pseudo- and chimeric viruses are viable stand-ins for the real thing. SARS-CoV-2 is a uniquely bulky virus—its genome is roughly 30 kilobases, while HIV and VSV sit around 10 kilobases—and while it is more similar to HIV, none of the three are closely related. Fortunately, both HIV and VSV appear to be compatible for making coronavirus models.  Sean Whelan, a virologist at Washington University in St. Louis, is one of many scientists who has developed a viable chimeric virus platform and quantified its performance in the face of antibodies against the real thing. To do this, he developed two complimentary assays—one for use in infectious disease laboratories with the BSL-3 clearance required to handle live SARS-CoV-2 and another for labs working under a lower, BSL-2 clearance—and studied how each virus responded to a battery of different treatments. It wasn’t enough, he says, to test the viruses’ ability to evade just one type of antibody, so he used monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and serum from recovered COVID-19 patients—as well as a type of ACE2 decoy protein suggested as a possible therapeutic to draw the virus away from the cells’ own receptor. “We wanted to really validate that the tool that we generated did appear exactly, with everything we could throw at it, the same way as SARS-CoV-2.”  The BSL-2 assay Whelan designed uses a chimeric VSV that includes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and produces a green fluorescent protein as a signal for infection (luciferase is also often used). Whelan exposed human cells to his chimeric virus until 100 cells had been infected. Then, he bathed the cells in each type of antibody and the decoy protein and recorded how quickly and to what extent the chimeric virus was able to escape them.  Simultaneously, Whelan’s colleague Mike Diamond, an immunologist at Washington University School of Medicine, developed a BSL-3 assay using a live clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. Similar to Whelan’s assay, he exposed 100 infected cells to the same litany of tests and used immunostaining to track infected cells over time.  The results, published in Cell Host and Microbe in September, demonstrate that the two assays produce neutralization profiles for each exposure that align 93 percent of the time, meaning that the chimeric virus is a suitable proxy for assessing the ability of antibodies to shut down SARS-CoV-2. Many papers have published similar results, comparing their assays against wildtype coronavirus. This validation against the true virus is important, Whelan says, because a chimeric virus “looks like COVID from the outside, but it’s not COVID on the inside.”  A speedy means for tracking emerging variants  While studies involving true isolates of SARS-CoV-2 will always be the gold standard for understanding the complex dynamics of COVID-19, there are instances in which pseudo- and chimeric viruses are better choices. For one, such models are inherently more genetically stable than their wildtype counterparts. Viruses change a bit each time they interact with a new host, and individual copies within a single person might not be identical. In the lab, viruses can also evolve new mutations in response to the types of cells used to culture them. Viruses propagated in monkey cells, for example, may adopt different mutations than those cultured in human cells.  One of the key advantages is just the ease of use in the laboratory. —Carol Weiss, US Food and Drug Administration  When scientists engineer proxies of SARS-CoV-2, they can control for some of that variation by using plasmids that all contain a single clone of the spike protein. “One of the key advantages is just the ease of use in the laboratory,” the FDA’s Weiss tells The Scientist. “It’s not a mixture of mutations. We know exactly what we’re testing.”  In some instances, researchers specifically want to study new mutations to, say, see how they might change the efficacy of vaccines. Already, notable variants have emerged in the UK, South Africa, and Brazil that dampen the effectiveness of some vaccines. South Africa recently halted the rollout of AstraZeneca’s vaccine after it produced only a weak response against mild and moderate illness, and Moderna announced plans to modify the second iteration of its vaccine in an effort to remain robust against these new variants. For studying such mutations in the spike protein, pseudoviruses offer a much faster model for generating and testing new versions than the actual virus does.  See “Vaccines Versus the Mutants”  Rather than having to clone each new variant as it emerges in wildtype specimens to assess whether a vaccinated individual’s antibodies will be effective, pseudoviruses allow scientists to quickly create new models with the same mutations to run their experiments. Theodora Hatziioannou, a virologist at the Rockefeller University, says that she routinely screens as many as 1,000 pseudovirus samples within 48 hours to determine whether any are a cause for concern, a process that would take much longer were she waiting for live clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 bearing the same mutations. With pseudoviruses, “you are able to test a lot more samples much faster with the appropriate replicates.”  Hatziioannou’s team recently tested the blood of 20 patients who had received either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine and identified individuals who mounted a robust antibody response to the virus. They extracted and isolated 18 unique antibodies associated with the spike protein’s receptor-binding domain (RBD) and exposed a VSV-based chimeric virus bearing the SARS-CoV-2 spike to each antibody type individually to see which mutations are selects for as the virus replicates.  Next, they engineered HIV-based pseudoviruses with each unique spike mutation that resulted from the VSV experiments and used their own neutralization assay to determine whether the mutations conferred resistance to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. To confirm that the virus would behave the same when exposed to a cocktail of many different antibodies, as in a human body, the researchers also pitted the pseudoviruses against plasma taken from recovered patients.  Their results, shared on the preprint server bioRxiv on January 19 and recently accepted in Nature, demonstrate that many mutations do decrease the ability of neutralizing antibodies to effectively combat the virus. “In all cases, the mutations identified by the VSV [chimeric virus] were mutations that conferred resistance in the HIV pseudotype,” Hatziioannou says, although she adds that vaccines are still an important tool. When they looked specifically at mutations found in the B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 variants, first identified in South Africa and the UK, respectively, they found that the neutralizing ability “was a bit weaker than a virus without these substitutions, but the effects were overall small.”  Where pseudo- and chimeric viruses fall short  While these surrogate platforms have been useful tools for studying how SARS-CoV-2 enters our cells, there will always be a need for BSL-3 labs that can study the virus directly. “The disadvantage of using pseudotypes is that the only biological property that you’re really going to learn about coronaviruses is those properties that relate to the spike protein,” Vicente Planelles, a pathologist at the University of Utah, tells The Scientist. “As soon as we go beyond the processes that the spike is responsible for, we need a different model.”  No pseudovirus platform can fully recapitulate how the virus propagates and releases new copies of itself, for example, nor can scientists use them to study other mechanisms by which the virus circumvents the body’s immune system.  In addition, while pseudoviruses are useful for assessing the efficacy of vaccines and antibody therapies, they are less helpful with respect to evaluating other drugs that treat the severity of the disease. Remdesivir, for example, was highlighted as a promising option early in the pandemic before conflicting evidence cast its effectiveness into doubt. But the family of drugs to which remdesivir belongs, called nucleoside analogs, could prove useful in preventing extreme illness if scientists could find a better candidate. These drugs work by interfering with a virus’s ability to replicate, which pseudoviruses do not do. “If we found nucleoside analogs that work better than remdesivir, we would be in great shape,” Planelles says. “But you cannot probe that with a pseudovirus, because the gene [that the drug targets] is an internal gene that is not the spike.”",true/false,
13,"ADVERTISEMENT The fire that gutted a flank of the Treasury House, office of the Accountant-General of the Federation, was caused by an electric spark at about 10 a.m. on Wednesday, the Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Clem Agba, says. Mr Agba spoke with journalists after the fire was put out. He said the fire started in an office on the third floor of the building. He further explained that the fire occurred “after an officer came to the office. He said he put on the air conditioner and there was a spark and immediately he put it off.” Earlier, the Federal Fire Service announced in a tweet that its team had put out the fire, with combined efforts from sister-agencies. This was buttressed by Mr Agba who said the fire service initially had difficulty getting into the building, but after about 35 minutes the fire was contained. “They got inside and fought the fire. Five fire trucks were used within 35 minutes,” he said. Already, there are subtle innuendos on social media that the fire was staged to excuse the government of accounting for funds meant to fight COVID-19 in the country. But Mr Agba brushed this aside, saying that not only is its data intact, its operations are largely digital. “We have gone round the offices that were affected, our data centre where all our records are fully intact. There is no disruption. For a while now we have gone digital,” the minister added, a mask strapped around his mouth, himself and his audience violating the physical distancing directive. “Even if the data centre were to be affected, we have a backup centre that is outside Abuja, in the event we experience loss of any data. “The only thing that happened to the data centre is the cooling unit which is in the exterior at the back. The cooling unit will be put in order,” he noted, saying that the unit has been closed temporarily. Meanwhile the FCT police commissioner, Bala Ciroma, who also briefed journalists at the scene of the incident, said an investigation into the cause of the fire had commenced. The minister alluded to this, too. He said while “a few documents were burnt,” the extent of the damages is yet to be ascertained.”",true/false,
14,"A medical worker fills a syringe with a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at Tokyo Medical Center in Tokyo on Feb. 17. (AP Photo)  Japan’s rollout of COVID-19 vaccines began belatedly in mid-February, months behind the United States and many other countries. Officials blamed a shortage of Pfizer Inc. vaccine from Europe as the main culprit in the delay. But three months later, with shipments stabilized and officials attempting to accelerate vaccinations, Japan remains one of the world’s least protected.  Officials say there is a critical shortage of trained staff to give shots. Despite Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s pledge to have all eligible people fully vaccinated by the end of September, some officials say it could take until next year. It will be impossible for Japan to achieve protective “herd immunity” in the two months before the Tokyo Olympics are to begin.  It’s uncertain whether Japan’s already-strained healthcare system can treat extra visitors during the games as it struggles to handle local patients and mass inoculations.  Suga’s government is facing heavy pressure from a public increasingly frustrated by the slow vaccine rollout and repeated declarations of states of emergency. Many now oppose hosting the Olympics.  WHY THE VACCINE DELAY?  The slow start was because Japan requested domestic clinical trials in addition to Pfizer Inc.’s testing in other countries.  Dozens of nations accepted the results of Pfizer’s multinational tests released in November and began vaccinations. The additional testing in Japan took extra months, though the government then took just two months to grant its approval for the vaccine, much faster than the typical one year.  The vaccine made by Moderna Inc. is to be approved later this month after a similar process for use at two large-scale inoculation centers in Tokyo and Osaka. Approval for a third, AstraZeneca, is pending.  WHY DID JAPAN ASK FOR MORE DATA?  People in Japan are often skeptical about foreign-made drugs, especially vaccines, and officials say they needed to thoroughly address safety concerns.  Pfizer’s international tests were conducted from July to November on about 44,000 people in six countries, including about 2,000 Asians. Japan requested tests on 160 Japanese people, triggering criticism that testing such a small number added little but delay.  Japanese health officials have defended the delay as necessary to build confidence in the vaccine. But Suga has recently acknowledged a need to adapt rules to cope with the emergency.  WHY IS VACCINE CONFIDENCE LOW?  Japan’s mistrust of vaccines is decades old, partly because side effects have often been played up.  In the 1990s, the government scrapped mandatory inoculations after a court ruling held it responsible for side effects linked to several vaccines.  More recently, Japan stopped recommending the human papillomavirus, or HPV, vaccine after media reports of alleged side effects, renewing concerns despite its widespread use overseas as protection against cervical cancer.  WHAT IS JAPAN’S VACCINE TIMELINE?  Inoculations started in Japan in mid-February and only about 1 percent of the population has been fully vaccinated. Less than one-third of the 4.8 million prioritized medical workers have received their second shots as of Wednesday.  Vaccinations for 36 million elderly people began in mid-April, and about half a million have received their initial shots. The government aims to finish their second shots by the end of July, at least a month behind the original schedule, but about 15 percent of municipalities say they still need more time, according to a government survey this week. Health experts and some officials say it may take until next spring for the rest of the population to be vaccinated.  DOES JAPAN HAVE ENOUGH VACCINE?  Japan has secured the supply of 344 million doses, enough to cover its entire population, through the end of this year. That includes 194 million doses from Pfizer, 120 million from AstraZeneca and 50 million from Moderna.  Vaccine shipments picked up in May, and health ministry data show that about 7 million doses are currently sitting unused in freezers, despite initial concerns of supply shortages.  Officials say their bigger concern is a shortage of medical staff to administer the shots. Only doctors and nurses are allowed to give them in Japan’s conservative medical culture.  Dentists are willing to help and are authorized but have not been called upon. Getting shots from pharmacists at drug stores as in the U.S. or from volunteers with no medical background other than brief training as in Britain remain unthinkable in Japan.  IS JAPAN DEVELOPING ITS OWN VACCINES?  Several Japanese companies and research organizations are developing possible coronavirus vaccines, including some that are being clinically tested. Shionogi and Co. said recently it hopes to get its vaccine candidate approved by the end of this year.  Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. will distribute the Moderna vaccine and produce the Novavax vaccine in Japan, and JCR Pharmaceuticals Co. will produce the AstraZeneca vaccine under a licensing deal.  Experts say vaccine development is unpopular in Japan because of its risks, the time-consuming process and a lack of government funding.",true/false,
15,"WSTA scores historic win as Government announce scrapping of arduous and unnecessary wine paperwork  The Wine and Spirit Trade Association has won a significant post-Brexit victory, for its members and consumers, after government has agreed to scrap wine-specific paperwork on imports from across the globe.  Following the referendum, the WSTA started a campaign calling for Government to do away with the time consuming and costly VI-1 forms on imported wine.  The historic removal of this unnecessary red tape will mean the UK’s 33 million wine consumers will be able to continue to enjoy the vast range of imported wines without additional costs.  After leaving the EU the WSTA warned that the introduction of the new forms and laboratory test demands would have brought wine imports from the EU to a standstill and cost the industry approximately £70 million. Today’s decision to scrap all wine import certificates, not just those for EU wine, will see even greater savings – approximately £100m.  Defra’s announcement that wine-specific VI-1 forms will now not be required for imports from the EU and beyond, is a huge boost for producers, importers and consumers – 99% of wine consumed in the UK is imported, with 55% of that coming from the EU.  The UK wine industry contributes around £11 billion every year in economic activity and employs 130,000 people across the supply chain. The scrapping of these non-tariff barriers, championed by the WSTA will prevent the price of a bottle of wine increasing by around 13p.  If the plans to introduce VI-1s to wine coming in from the EU had come into play, imports would have required laboratory analysis – a process the WSTA estimates would have cost about £330 per shipment and may well have put off smaller producers from sending their wines to the UK reducing consumer choice.  Miles Beale, Chief Executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, said:  “This is a truly historic moment for the UK’s world-leading wine trade. We have spent more than two years campaigning relentlessly to avoid the introduction of new import certificates for EU wine imports on the one hand and scrapping the unnecessary and costly VI-1 wine paperwork for on-EU wine imports on the other. The first would have cost the UK wine industry some £70m [annually], reduced consumer choice and bumped up prices. The second will increase those savings to over £100 million. It’s a truly fantastic outcome.  “It is heartening to know that Government trust the WSTA’s advice and are listening to the concerns of business, particularly SMEs. This is a major win for wine lovers and the UK wine industry. I am sure corks will be popping across the globe in celebration of this most welcome news.”  James Miles, Chairman and Managing Director (Co-Founder) at Liv-ex Ltd said:  “I cannot overstate how important today’s announcement is to the UK wine industry. The WSTA and its members have been campaigning hard to stop UK officials from imposing unnecessary import regulations on the wine trade.  “Government has shown it is in tune with business by taking this once in a lifetime opportunity. By removing these unnecessary and costly non-tariff barriers to trade it has re-set our trading arrangements with the rest of the world in a way that that will enhance the UK’s leading position in the global wine trade.”",true/false,
16,"Donald Trump’s hats have quickly become a signature totem of the 2016 campaign, a kitsch magnet that serves ironic hipsters and sincere supporters alike. The red-and-white caps are emblazoned with the real estate mogul’s oft-repeated slogan, “Make America Great Again.” But look around the factory floor where these hats are being made by the thousands, and you’ll find faces that don’t seem to fit into Trump’s America. Yolanda Melendrez is one of them. Melendrez, an immigrant from Mexico who was brought to the United States by her parents when she was a baby, has worked at the Carson-based Cali-Fame headwear company since 1991. TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >> “When we first got the order [for the Trump hats], I said to myself, ‘Just wait until he sees who’s making his hats. We’re Latinos, we’re Mexicans, Salvadoreños.’” Melendrez, 44, started out as a machine operator, stitching the seams of baseball caps. She now works as a lead on the floor, roaming as she checks on the flow of work, supervising other sewing machine operators and embroiders. She became a citizen when she was 20; her parents are permanent residents. Melendrez was 14 when she had her first child, and the job has helped her pay rent and put food on the table for her kids, she says. Workers stitch together hats on the factory floor of Cali-Fame in Carson. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times) One recent Saturday at the Cali-Fame factory, about 20 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, dozens of employees, almost all of them Latino, were working away while machines whirred all around them. Some peered over glasses as their deft hands assembled one hat after another; others swept scraps of fabric from the floor. They were surrounded by stacks of freshly minted camouflage-print caps, with the presidential hopeful’s all-capital-letter promise emblazoned on the front in orange. Advertisement Brian Kennedy, president of Cali-Fame, says that when the Trump campaign asked his family business to make the now-famous hats, he knew he would need to address his workers. “I said to them, ‘We’re not political. We’re here to work,’” Kennedy told the Los Angeles Times from the second floor of his factory, the steady sound of sewing machines in action below him. “And I haven’t gotten any negative comments.” The hats, known best in the signature red with white font, have inspired hipster fashion trends, Halloween costumes, a make-your-own-Trump-hat generator and even a short-lived rumor they actually were made in China. (They weren’t, Kennedy assures). In fact, unlike some Trump-branded lines of clothing sold nationally, this headwear is legitimately made in the USA, creating jobs for people who hail from the very places Trump has at times disparaged. The company employs about 100 people in a 30,000-square-foot warehouse. About 80% of the company’s workforce is Latino, Kennedy estimates. He says that every worker has his or her immigration status verified. The “Make America Great Again” hats have been a boon to Kennedy’s business, which pulled in more than $270,000 from the Trump campaign last quarter, according to campaign finance records. The merchandise was a portion of the more than $825,000 the Trump campaign dropped on bumper stickers, T-shirts, hats and other promotional gear, the largest category of Trump’s spending outside of travel. The hats have seemingly been a boon for Trump’s campaign too. Most of the caps sell for $25 each and appear to have boosted the billionaire’s small donations column, making donors of those who purchase them, ironically or not. SIGN UP for the free Essential Politics newsletter >> Kennedy and his brother, Tim, Cali-Fame’s vice president of sales, have been reluctant to wade into the political fray. Brian Kennedy, who initially declined to be interviewed, says he’s turned down dozens of media requests. Advertisement A visit to the factory on a weekday suggests the business might have easily remained anonymous, save for campaign finance records: The windows were black and no signs of life were obvious early one evening, except for a few modestly appointed cars in the parking lot. Kennedy and his brother bristled at the news coverage they received for weeks after campaign finance disclosures were released. Melendrez says she tries her best to avoid it too. She says she’s heard some of the things Trump has said about Mexican immigrants and Latinos like her, but she attempts to ignore them, even as headlines about Trump’s proposals to build an impenetrable wall on the border of Mexico and his comments writing off some Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals continue to dominate coverage of the Republican front-runner’s campaign. Advertisement When Macy’s cut ties with Trump over his remarks, which the company said were “inconsistent with Macy’s values,” Trump publicly accused the retailer of supporting illegal immigration. “A lot of what he says about Latinos is not correct,” Melendrez says with a shrug just as a buzzer signals the end of her Saturday overtime shift and workers line up to clock out. Spanish punctuates the air as the machines sputter to a stop. But Melendrez doesn’t pay the media reports much mind. She knows she has a job to do. “You know,” she says, “he’s giving us a lot of work. Keeping us busy.… It’s a job, I get paid to do it and it pays my bills.” And for that, Melendrez says, she’s thankful. Brian Kennedy is president of Cali-Fame. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times) A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign did not return a request for comment. Although Kennedy downplayed the role Trump’s orders have played for his business as the holiday season begins, several employees said this is the busiest November they’ve seen in years, with plenty of overtime work to go around. Kennedy says that since his father bought the business in 1977, Cali-Fame has weathered rising labor costs, employee downsizing, changing technologies and cutthroat competition from cheap overseas labor. Advertisement The factory is on the edge of an industrial district that presses up against tight rows of neatly fenced single-story homes. On the other side of the 710 Freeway and across the L.A. River is a country club and golf course serving Long Beach’s nearby tony neighborhoods. “To be a local manufacturer in the United States, there’s so many challenges, not only in America but in California alone,” he says while surveying the massive warehouse. For decades, the company had its bread and butter in golf tournament caps and other promotional headwear. The company has taken in other work, Kennedy says, such as embroidering ready-made shirts and sweatshirts, to help boost revenue. More recently, the manufacturer has branched out into street wear and urban fashion, launching a brand that has focused on supporting burgeoning clothing companies. Wood panels separate a portion of the warehouse for a showroom of sorts, allowing Cali-Fame to host an occasional sale. On a recent weekend, curious deal-seekers browsed straw fedoras and baseball caps of varying designs, but no Trump hats were in sight. “The old cliche is that you roll with the punches,” Tim Kennedy says. “We’ve done that many times, and we’re constantly changing what we do and how we do things.” But it’s been increasingly difficult to stay competitive, the Kennedy brothers say. Rising healthcare costs, the possibility of a $15 minimum wage countywide and workers’ compensation laws have been a “juggling act” to keep up with, they say. Brian Kennedy says his company has been making hats for Trump’s golf courses for about a decade, which is how he got connected with the campaign. These caps -- “the five-panel trucker hat with cord,” Kennedy will tell you -- have become a solid front-runner when it comes to 2016 campaign kitsch. “It’s a classic,” says Tim Kennedy. “Everything comes full circle in the fashion business.

17,"After Category 5 Cyclone Pam tore his country apart, prompting a humanitarian emergency, Vanuatu's President Baldwin Lonsdale pinned at least part of the blame for the islands' predicament on manmade global warming.  The storm, which struck with a ferocity the country had not experienced before in modern history, had sustained winds of 165 miles per hour, with gusts exceeding 200 miles per hour when it roared through the tiny country. It leveled homes and businesses, and stripped trees bare on the most populated island of Efate, including the capital of Port Vila. The death toll stood at 24 on Tuesday, but it is expected to rise as more information begins streaming in from outlying islands that have been cut off from the outside world.  “This is a very devastating cyclone … I term it a monster that has hit Vanuatu,” Lonsdale said at a U.N. disaster summit in Japan, according to The Guardian. “It is a setback for the government and for the people of Vanuatu. … All the development that has taken place has been wiped out.”  He said the cyclone seasons that the nation had experienced were the result of climate change. “We see the level of sea rise … the cyclone seasons, the warm, the rain, all this is affected,” he said.  So, is the president correct to link the devastating cyclone to global warming? Or is the tie so tenuous that it's almost nonexistent? The answer, as it often is in climate science, is far more nuanced than Vanuatu's president portrays it.  Scientists say unusually mild sea surface temperatures and added atmospheric water vapor helped the storm intensify before slamming into Vanuatu. At the same time, rising sea levels likely made the storm more damaging than it would have been just a few decades ago.  Here are the main factors to consider when analyzing the potential ties between Cyclone Pam and the warming climate.  Ocean temperatures are the main suspect  Scientists Mashable contacted said the storm intensified rapidly before hitting Vanuatu, aided by an area of unusually mild ocean waters and favorable atmospheric conditions. Ocean temperatures in the area where the cyclone intensified were up to 2 degrees Celsius above average for this time of year (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).  Some — but not all — of the sea surface temperature anomalies in the Southwest Pacific Ocean are likely related to global warming, according to Kevin Trenberth, a climate researcher with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, as well as other experts.  Global sea surface temperatures, showing an area of extremely warm water near Vanuatu and Australia. Image: NOAA/ESRL  According to Trenberth, about about 0.6 degrees Celsius, or 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit, of the ocean temperature anomalies ""can be blamed on human-induced global warming"" while the rest is ""natural"" and associated with an ongoing El Niño event in the tropical Pacific Ocean.  El Niño is a climate phenomenon that features warmer than average ocean temperatures in much of the tropical Pacific Ocean. It can alter worldwide weather patterns, including tropical cyclone seasons in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.  Whatever the cause, though, the warm ocean waters can supercharge storms like Cyclone Pam, as more evaporation takes place and moisture is added to the air.  ""The atmosphere all around there has some 10 to 20% more moisture in it than a comparable storm in the 1970s would have had. The high sea surface temperatures and the water vapor fueled the storm and undoubtedly increased its intensity and size,"" Trenberth said in an email conversation. ""The winds are stronger, the storm surge is greater on higher sea levels.""  El Niño ""has played a role here on top of global warming. But strong storms can certainly occur in that region anyway (but not this strong). The sea surface temperatures are over 86 degrees Fahrenheit for heaven's sake,"" he said.  An analysis of long-term trends in sea surface temperatures in the region where Cyclone Pam rapidly intensified into a Category 5 monster shows that there has been a warming trend since 1948, although there are considerable uncertainties in this data, says Michael Ventrice, an operational meteorologist at WSI Corporation in Massachusetts. He said it is not clear from the data whether the higher temperatures were a result of natural variations or human effects.  Sea surface temperature departures from average in the vicinity of Vanuatu and Australia as of March 16, 2015. Image: WeatherbellAnalytics  ""The bottom line point is that there has been a long-term warming trend observed in the location where Pam intensified,"" Ventrice said.  Madden and Julian...  Ventrice says Cyclone Pam ""thrived"" in an environment that was well-suited to explosive intensification. These environmental factors included the warm ocean waters that extended deep into the ocean, as well as a natural weather cycle known as the Madden Julian Oscillation, or MJO.  In certain instances, the MJO can encourage the air to rise, forming thunderstorms as well as tropical cyclones. Think of the MJO as a helping hand that likely aided the storm's rapid intensification.  ""The MJO acts to moisten the middle and upper-levels of the atmosphere and reduce vertical wind shear, both are which parameters that are musts for intensification,"" Ventrice said.  Few robust trends in tropical cyclones near Vanuatu  Climate research has shown that tropical cyclones in many ocean basins are becoming stronger and lasting longer than they used to. However, the Southwest Pacific, where Cyclone Pam occurred, is not one of these areas, possibly due to the relative paucity of data there.  Kerry Emanuel, a meteorologist at MIT who is a prominent researcher examining global warming-related trends in tropical storms and hurricanes, told Mashable that not much can be said about trends in the vicinity of Vanuatu.  ""Ironically, this is a part of the world where we do not observe any significant upward trends in tropical cyclone metrics, and few models predict upward trends there as a consequence of global warming,"" he said in an email.  In a post for the blog Realclimate on March 18, Emanuel wrote that there are signs that some parameters of severe tropical cyclones are changing, even in areas like the Southwest Pacific basin where data is relatively sparse.  ""While Pam and Haiyan, as well as other recent tropical cyclone disasters, cannot be uniquely pinned on global warming, they have no doubt been influenced by natural and anthropogenic climate change and they do remind us of our continuing vulnerability to such storms,"" Emanuel said.  Tom Knutson, a researcher with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, says that of the six ocean basins that give rise to tropical cyclones, the Southwest Pacific basin is an area that shows the least tendency for an increase in storm activity by the end of the century. In fact, there may be a decrease in cyclone frequency or intensity there, based on the most recent computer model simulations, Knutson says.  James Elsner, a professor at Florida State University who has been investigating how global warming may be altering the strongest storms on Earth, says he would be surprised if South Pacific storms were not growing stronger, like storms elsewhere. But the data is not yet there to prove it.  ""We have a pretty solid basis (physical & empirical) for our understanding that ocean heat makes the strongest tropical cyclones stronger,"" he said. ""Empirically it has been shown for the global as a whole and for the North Atlantic. But the signal is hard to see in noisy data, and especially where confounded by a trend toward fewer cyclones.""  Although global warming signals may not be present yet, multiple studies have shown that manmade global warming is likely to cause tropical cyclones (including hurricanes and typhoons) to be more intense, on average, than they are today, which means these storms will be more destructive. Manmade warming is also likely to lead to an uptick in the number of extremely intense tropical cyclones in some ocean basins during the next several decades, according to peer reviewed research.  Since sea-level rise is already making cyclones more destructive by giving them a higher launching pad for storm surge flooding, this means that future storms may be an order of magnitude more damaging than what we typically experience today.  As a small, low-lying island nation, Vanuatu is acutely aware of rising sea levels due to global warming. Along with other small island countries, some of which were affected by the same cyclone, Vanuatu has lobbied the U.N. in favor of steep greenhouse gas emissions cuts to reduce the severity of climate change, seeing it as a matter of its very survival as a nation.",true/false,

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — James Hansen wishes he was wrong. He wasn’t.  NASA’s top climate scientist in 1988, Hansen warned the world on a record hot June day 30 years ago that global warming was here and worsening. In a scientific study that came out a couple months later, he even forecast how warm it would get, depending on emissions of heat-trapping gases.  The hotter world that Hansen envisioned in 1988 has pretty much come true so far, more or less. Three decades later, most climate scientists interviewed rave about the accuracy of Hansen’s predictions given the technology of the time.  ADVERTISEMENT  Hansen won’t say, “I told you so.”  “I don’t want to be right in that sense,” Hansen told The Associated Press, in an interview is his New York penthouse apartment. That’s because being right means the world is warming at an unprecedented pace and ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland are melting.  Hansen said what he really wishes happened is “that the warning be heeded and actions be taken.”  They weren’t. Hansen, now 77, regrets not being “able to make this story clear enough for the public.”  Global warming was not what Hansen set out to study when he joined NASA in 1972. The Iowa native studied Venus — a planet with a runaway greenhouse-effect run — when he got interested in Earth’s ozone hole. As he created computer simulations, he realized that “this planet was more interesting than Venus.” And more important.  In his 1988 study, Hansen and colleagues used three different scenarios for emissions of heat-trapping gases — high, low and medium. Hansen and other scientists concentrated on the middle scenario.  Hansen projected that by 2017, the globe’s five-year average temperature would be about 1.85 degrees (1.03 degree Celsius) higher than the 1950 to 1980 NASA-calculated average. NASA’s five-year average global temperature ending in 2017 was 1.48 degrees above the 30-year average. (He did not take into account that the sun would be cooling a tad, which would reduce warming nearly two-tenths of a degree Fahrenheit, said the Scripps Institution of Oceanography’s Jeff Severinghaus.)  Hansen also predicted a certain number of days of extreme weather — temperature above 95 degrees, freezing days, and nights when the temperatures that don’t drop below 75 — per year for four U.S. cities in the decade of the 2010s.  Hansen’s forecast generally underestimated this decade’s warming in Washington, overestimated it in Omaha, was about right in New York and mixed in Memphis.  ADVERTISEMENT  Clara Deser, climate analysis chief at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said Hansen’s global temperature forecast was “incredible” and his extremes for the cities were “astounding” in their accuracy. Berkeley Earth’s Zeke Hausfather gives Hansen’s predictions a 7 or 8 for accuracy, out of 10; he said Hansen calculated that the climate would respond a bit more to carbon dioxide than scientists now think.  University of Alabama Huntsville’s John Christy, a favorite of those who downplay climate change, disagreed. Using mathematical formulas to examine Hansen’s projections, he concluded: “Hansen’s predictions were wrong as demonstrated by hypothesis testing.”  Hansen had testified before Congress on climate change at a fall 1987 hearing that didn’t get much attention — likely because it was a cool day, he figured.  So the next hearing was scheduled for the next summer, and the weather added heat to Hansen’s words. At 2 p.m., the temperature hit a record high 98 degrees and felt like 102.  It was then and there that Hansen went out on a limb and proclaimed that global warming was already here. Until then most scientists merely warned of future warming.  He left NASA in 2013, devoting more time to what he calls his “anti-government job” of advocacy.  Hansen, still at Columbia University, has been arrested five times for environmental protests. Each time, he hoped to go to trial “to draw attention to the issues” but the cases were dropped. He writes about saving the planet for his grandchildren, including one who is suing the federal government over global warming inaction. His advocacy has been criticized by scientific colleagues, but he makes no apologies.  “If scientists are not allowed to talk about the policy implications of the science, who is going to do that? People with financial interests?” Hansen asked.  ___  Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears .

19,"Washington (CNN) A large gun-rights rally in Virginia's state capital unfolded peacefully Monday despite earlier fears of the kind of violence that took place in nearby Charlottesville three years ago.  Security was tight as gun-rights advocates descended on Richmond for ""Lobby Day"" to oppose legislation that would restrict access to firearms in the state. The commonwealth braced for the potential of extremist and white nationalist groups to disrupt the peaceful demonstrations with violence and riots, and the state's Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, declared a temporary state of emergency last week to ban open and concealed firearms and other weapons from the state capitol grounds.  The crowd, however, was peaceful, with no immediate reports of violence. One person was arrested with one felony count of wearing a mask in public. A 21-year-old woman was arrested and charged after having been warned two times not to wear a bandana over her face and then arrested when an officer saw her wearing it a third time, police said.  Some streets surrounding the capitol grounds, several of which were closed ahead of the event, were packed with protesters. About 22,000 people attended the rally, according to the Virginia Division of Capitol Police. That includes about 6,000 people in the official rally area and 16,000 outside.  Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, welcomed the fact that the day passed without serious incident.  ""Thousands of people came to Richmond to make their voices heard. Today showed that when people disagree, they can do so peacefully,"" Northam said in a statement. ""The issues before us evoke strong emotions, and progress is often difficult. I will continue to listen to the voices of Virginians, and I will continue to do everything in my power to keep our Commonwealth safe.""  In addition to the people on the capitol grounds, there was a large group outside the fenced area, which was not under the ban on weapons and is an open carry area. They were chanting ""Northam out"" and outnumbered the group on the capitol grounds. There was a heavy police presence among this crowd, and law enforcement could also be seen on the rooftops, providing extra security to the area.

Despite fears of potential violence, President Donald Trump urged his followers to stand up to state Democrats' gun control efforts.  ""The Democrat Party in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia are working hard to take away your 2nd Amendment rights,"" Trump tweeted late Monday morning. ""This is just the beginning. Don't let it happen, VOTE REPUBLICAN in 2020!  According to Northam, law enforcement had learned of credible threats of violence surrounding Monday's rally, made from mainstream and alternative dark web channels used by violent groups and white nationalists outside of Virginia.  That led the Democratic governor to issue a temporary state of emergency last week through Tuesday, banning open and concealed firearms and other weapons from the state capitol grounds.  When announcing the ban on Wednesday, Northam said he hoped to prevent incidents like the violence that erupted three years ago at the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, which left one counter protester dead and several others injured.  On Thursday, the FBI arrested three alleged members of a white supremacist group, including two men accused of possessing a machine gun, over 1,000 rounds of ammunition and body armor parts.  Sean Restatter, 22, told CNN on the capitol grounds Monday that the protest was intended to be peaceful.  ""There might be far-right and far-left groups that might be out here today, but the vast majority of the message is 'guns save lives' and we believe in the 2nd Amendment,"" he said.  Right to gun ownership for 'law abiding citizens'  The gun rights group -- the Virginia Citizens Defense League -- who organized protests on so-called Lobby Day said their demonstrations would be peaceful and intended to draw attention to "" Second Amendment sanctuaries ,"" or what they refer to as localities that vow not to enforce ""unconstitutional"" gun laws.  One of the speakers invited by VCDL included Stephen Willeford , the man who shot and chased the shooter in the Sutherland Springs, Texas, church massacre in 2017.  The group's president, Philip Van Cleave, previously told CNN that they've been attending Lobby Day since 2003 to advocate for guns rights by ""law abiding citizens,"" and the ""grassroots"" effort hasn't had any incidents of violence.  Northam's executive order was quickly challenged in court by VCDL, the Gun Owners of America and three private individuals, who argued that the ban violated their rights under the First and Second Amendments. A judge upheld the governor's temporary ban on Thursday, leading them to file an appeal with Virginia's Supreme Court. On Friday, the Supreme Court of Virginia refused their petition, leaving Northam's ban in effect.  But since winning control of the state legislature in November, Democrats have more successfully advanced gun control measures in the 2020 legislative session.  The Virginia Senate, along party lines, approved several gun measures last week, including background checks for private firearm transfers, limiting gun purchases to one handgun a month and allowing localities to ban firearms in public during a permitted event.  The bills now head to the Virginia House of Delegates.  This story is breaking and will be updated.",true/false,
20,"Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far? By Tom Edgington  BBC Reality Check Published 21 October 2021  Image source, Getty Images  The UK has agreed a free trade agreement in principle with New Zealand.  Since Brexit, the UK has had the freedom to pursue its own trade deals. So far, it has signed trade deals and agreements in principle with 69 countries and one with the EU.  However, the majority are ""rollover"" deals - copying the terms of deals the UK already had when it was an EU member, rather than creating new benefits.  What is a free trade deal?  A free trade deal aims to encourage trade between countries by making it cheaper. This normally applies to goods, but occasionally to services as well.  Making trade cheaper is usually achieved by reducing or eliminating tariffs. These are government taxes or charges for trading goods across borders. A car importer might have to pay a 20% tariff on top of the vehicle's price, for example, to bring it into a country.  Trade agreements also aim to remove quotas (limits on the amount of goods that can be traded).  Trade can also be made simpler if countries have the same rules, such as the colour of wires in plugs. The closer the rules are, the less likely that goods need to be checked.  Image source, EPA Image caption, The UK-Japan deal was signed in October 2020  Why have tariffs and quotas at all?  While free trade agreements aim to boost trade, too many cheap imports could threaten a country's manufacturers. This could affect jobs.  For that reason, a government might choose to put tariffs on certain things. Tariffs on car imports, for example, could help protect local car makers from cheaper vehicles coming in from abroad.  What is the UK-New Zealand deal?  The latest UK trade deal is an agreement in principle reached with New Zealand on 20 October.  New Zealand is a small UK trading partner, accounting for less than 0.2% GDP. So the deal is unlikely to boost the UK economy by much. However, the deal could lead to more New Zealand lamb being sold in the UK.  As well as removing tariffs on goods such as clothing and machinery, the UK government says the deal will also cut red tape for businesses. Labour and the National Farmers Union, however, say the deal could hurt UK farmers and lower food standards.  What does the UK-EU trade deal mean?  After Brexit happened on 31 January 2020, the UK and EU needed to decide the rules for their future trading relationship.  This was important because the EU is the UK's largest and closest trading partner.  After months of negotiation - which went down to the wire - a UK-EU trade deal came into force on 1 January 2021.  The deal prevented any tariffs and quotas being introduced - which would have made it more expensive to trade.  Image source, Getty Images Image caption, The UK-EU trade deal went down to the wire, with fishing proving to be one of the major sticking points  But not everything is the same as it was before Brexit.  As the UK no longer has to follow EU rules on product standards, new checks have been introduced.  Strict EU laws on animal products also mean some UK products can no longer be exported.  The deal also does not completely eliminate the possibility of tariffs in future. Both sides will need to stay close to shared rules in areas like workers' rights and environmental protection. If either the UK or the EU shift their rules too far, the other side could introduce tariffs.  What happened to the trade agreements the UK was already part of?  Before Brexit, the UK was automatically part of any trade deal the EU had negotiated with another country. At the time the UK left, the EU had about 40 trade deals covering more than 70 countries.  The UK has negotiated rollover deals with 63 of these countries.  Image source, Getty Images  The UK is still discussing rollover agreements with a further three countries, but all the major ones are done.  Any existing EU agreement that was not rolled over ended on 31 December with trade then taking place on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms until a deal could be reached.  Trading on WTO terms means importers face tariffs and extra paperwork. For example, a shipment of bananas arriving at Portsmouth from Ghana was charged a tariff of £17,500 in January. Since then, an agreement with Ghana has been reached.  What about a UK-US trade deal?  The US is already a significant UK trading partner, accounting for £1 in every £6 of British trade.  Some smaller deals have already been reached - such as the export of British beef to the US, after a ban of more 20 years.  What about other trade agreements?  Image source, Getty Images Image caption, British farmers are worried about competing with cheap foreign imports, such as beef  The Australia deal, announced on 15 June, was the first trade agreement negotiated from scratch by the UK since it left the EU - although it has not yet been signed off and implemented.  UK farmers say the deal will mean they will be undercut by cheap imports, which will cost jobs. However, the UK government says the agreement means many British products will be cheaper to sell to Australia. It also insists the deal will contain protections for farmers, such as a cap on tariff-free imports for 15 years.  A deal with Japan was signed in October 2020 - the first that differed from an existing EU deal.",true/false,
21,"hirley-Anne Somerville: ""If your teacher thinks you deserve an A you will get an A from this."" Scotland's new education secretary has made a ""cast-iron guarantee"" that no young person will be further disadvantaged by this year's assessments. Shirley-Anne Somerville promised pupils ""If your teacher thinks you deserve an A, you will get an A"". She said she still had full confidence in the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA). But she said lessons had to be learned from the Covid experience. Asked by the BBC if she could give a cast-iron guarantee that the situation pupils faced last year - when grades were subject to an algorithm and were weighted by a school's past performance or postcode - would not happen again, she said: ""Absolutely"".She said: ""This year a teacher's judgement is based on an individual's demonstrated attainment. So if your teacher thinks you deserve an A, you will get an A. ""The assessment process is judged by your teacher and they will submit the grade. No-one is coming in to overrule that or second guess it. Your teacher will decide your grade, if you don't agree you have direct right of free appeal. No-one is coming in to second guess them or their teacher."" Two weeks from the end of a second turbulent school year, teachers, pupils and parents remain wary of qualification arrangements.No formal exams have taken place since 2019 and after a disastrous 2020 results day, all eyes are on the 2021 solution. The replacement has again drawn criticism for its numerous assessments and an unpopular appeals process. Last week, Ms Somerville announced a reform of the SQA and Education Scotland, just hours after Nicola Sturgeon gave the SQA her full confidence. ""We do have full confidence in the SQA,"" she said. ""But we also know that we need to learn lessons from the experience of Covid and also with the report coming up from the OECD, we, as a government, need to be open to reform, open to challenge and to suggestions of how we should change. ""The qualifications the SQA are delivering this year for young people are sound and they are credible, but that doesn't mean we should stop and we can't and shouldn't look at change and that's what we are determined to deliver."" Shirley-Anne Somerville announced reform of the SQA and Education Scotland in parliament last week Just one month into her new post, the new cabinet secretary said she had seen the anticipated international OECD report into the entire Scottish education system. Ahead of its publication this month, she said the Scottish government was ""open to reform"". Open to change ""It is very important that we demonstrate a direction of travel for the government and demonstrate an openness for change,"" she said. ""We know this big report is coming, we know the OECD has looked at education in the round and if the OECD is recommending change to us I think its quite right that early on in my time as education secretary say I am open to that change, I am open to that challenge, so is the whole of the Scottish government. ""That gives people at least a little time before that OECD report is published to take part in that conversation, have a think about what they want - because I hear a lot of people saying we should scrap the SQA or make dramatic changes but what I don't often hear is a solution to what can be replacements or what people want to change."" Rosshall Secondary School IMAGE SOURCE,GETTY IMAGES Looking ahead to the new school year in August, the education secretary said she would like to see schools return to normal, but that contingency arrangements were in place if schools needed to move to a different way of working. She gave parents and pupils reassurance that plans had been made. However, she said decisions had not yet been taken over next year's exams. Analysis box by Lucy Whyte, BBC Scotland education correspondent It's certainly planting her flag firmly in the ground. Given the outcry that there was last year and the criticism about how things have been working this year, Shirley-Anne Somerville obviously doesn't expect to be in the same position her predecessor John Swinney was in last year when he had to make that U-turn on results. She mentioned the OECD report a few times, particularly when talking about her decision to reform the SQA and Education Scotland, so that potentially hints that the report might include something about that. Presentational grey line Coming into the new role, Ms Somerville said she believed the government had a very good record on education and that she was seeing progress in closing the attainment gap, and that empowerment in schools was making a difference. But she admitted there was more to do. She said: ""When you look at context of Covid and reports coming out, the OECD, we know we can do more. ""We know we still have work to do, and Covid accentuated the need even more."" In response, Oliver Mundell, the Scottish Conservatives education spokesman, said he wanted to see the government to go further than reform. ""Rather than reforming the SQA I think they should be talking about axing it, scrapping it and starting from the beginning again, asking what kind of qualifications body do we want in Scotland, not shifting existing people around, and tinkering around the edges. The SQA has let young people down,"" he said.",true/false,
22,"“The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm.” Hurricane Harvey looms off the coast of Texas, as seen from aboard the International Space Station. Every so often, the worst-case scenario comes to pass. As of Sunday afternoon, the remnants of Hurricane Harvey seem likely to exceed the worst forecasts that preceded the storm. The entire Houston metropolitan region is flooding: Interstates are under feet of water, local authorities have asked boat owners to join rescue efforts, and most of the streams and rivers near the city are in flood stage. Some models suggest that the storm will linger over the area until Wednesday night, dumping 50 inches of water in total on Houston and the surrounding area. “Local rainfall amounts of 50 inches would exceed any previous Texas rainfall record. The breadth and intensity of this rainfall are beyond anything experienced before,” said a statement from the National Weather Service. “Catastrophic flooding is now underway and expected to continue for several days.” (In years of weather reporting, I have never seen a statement this blunt and ominous.) This means that thousands of people—and perhaps tens of thousands of people—are facing a terrifying and all-too-real struggle to survive right now. In an age when the climate is changing rapidly, a natural question to ask is: What role did human-caused global warming play in strengthening this storm? Climate scientists, who specialize in thinking about the Earth system as a whole, are often reticent to link any one weather event to global climate change. But they say that aspects of the case of Hurricane Harvey—and the recent history of tropical cyclones worldwide—suggest global warming is making a bad situation worse. It may not be obvious why global warming has anything to do with hurricane strength. Climate change is caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. These gases prevent some of the sun’s rays from bouncing back into space, trapping heat in the planetary system and raising air temperatures all over the world. This warmer air causes evaporation to happen faster, which can lead to more moisture in the atmosphere. But that phenomenon alone does not explain climate change’s effects on Harvey. Storms like Harvey are helped by one of the consequences of climate change: As the air warms, some of that heat is absorbed by the ocean, which in turn raises the temperature of the sea’s upper layers. Harvey benefited from unusually toasty waters in the Gulf of Mexico. As the storm roared toward Houston last week, sea-surface waters near Texas rose to between 2.7 and 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit above average. These waters were some of the hottest spots of ocean surface in the world. The tropical storm, feeding off this unusual warmth, was able to progress from a tropical depression to a category-four hurricane in roughly 48 hours. “This is the main fuel for the storm,” says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research. “Although these storms occur naturally, the storm is apt to be more intense, maybe a bit bigger, longer-lasting, and with much heavier rainfalls [because of that ocean heat].” This also suggests an explanation for one of Harvey’s strangest and scariest behaviors. The storm intensified up until the moment of landfall, achieving category-four strength hours before it slammed into the Texas coast. This is not only rare for tropical cyclones in the western Gulf of Mexico: It may be unique. In the past 30 years of records, no storms west of Florida have intensified in the last 12 hours before landfall. Why do storms normally weaken—and why didn’t Harvey? As mentioned above, hurricanes feed and grow on warm ocean surface waters. But as they grow, their strong winds often pick up seawater, churning the oceans and moving the warmest waters deep below the surface. The same winds also bring newer, colder water closer to the atmosphere, which usually serves to drain energy and weaken the storm. That didn’t happen with Harvey. The hurricane churned up water 100 or even 200 meters below the surface, said Trenberth, but this water was still warm—meaning that the storm could keep growing and strengthening. “Harvey was not in a good position to intensify the way it did, because it was so close to land. It’s amazing it was able to do that,” he told me. All of this said, a storm like Harvey could have happened even if there was no climate change. Planning experts have long fretted over the possibility of a major hurricane striking Houston. Harvey is also a powerful hurricane forming in one of the most hurricane-friendly regions of the world at the peak of hurricane season. Storms similar to it would form in any climate. But Trenberth says that the extra heat could make the storm more costly and more powerful, overpowering and eventually breaking local drainage systems. “The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm,” he said. “It may have been a strong storm, and it may have caused a lot of problems anyway—but [human-caused climate change] amplifies the damage considerably.” More generally, it’s still unclear what effect climate change is having on hurricane formation across the greater Atlantic Ocean. A draft version of a major U.S. government review of climate science due out later this year says there is “medium confidence” that human activities “have contributed to the observed upward trend in North Atlantic hurricane activity since the 1970s.” Houston has been ground zero for super-damaging storms lately. It has seen four 100-year flooding events since the spring of 2015, according to the meteorologist Eric Holthaus. The city also sees 167 percent more heavy downpours than it did in the 1950s. Meanwhile, only one-sixth of its residents have federal flood insurance, though that program has struggled to adjust to the increased flooding risk associated with climate change. Yet even compared to recent storms, Harvey is unprecedented—just the kind of weird weather that scientists expect to see more of as the planet warms. Harvey has already dumped more water on Harris County than Tropical Storm Allison, the area’s previous worst-ever flooding disaster in 2001, though it has only lasted half the time of that earlier storm. And it will keep raining. As of Sunday afternoon, Buffalo Bayou, a major river near downtown Houston, is one foot above flood stage. It is projected to rise as much as another 12 feet today alone.",true/false,
23,"Manchin and Capito Introduce Legislation to Improve Early Detection of Black Lung  Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin D-WV and Shelley Moore Capito R-WV introduced legislation to boost participation in federal programs that detect and treat black lung disease among coal miners.  “Coal miners sacrifice a lot, including their own health, to keep our lights on, heat our homes, and power our businesses. Black lung cases are at a 25-year high and with today’s technology and our knowledge of this disease, that is simply unacceptable. Our amendment will make sure more miners participate in early detection so we can catch it and treat it quicker. The health and safety of our miners should always be our number one priority and I will be fighting for this amendment to be included in the final spending bill,” Senator Manchin said.  “West Virginia coal miners have worked tirelessly for decades to keep industries and communities in this country moving,” Senator Capito said. “These resources dedicated to the early detection of black lung could be life-saving for thousands of hardworking West Virginians. Amazing work is being done in this area by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health’s Respiratory Health Division in Morgantown, and I am honored to help that work continue and provide assistance to those who have given so much to our state.”  According to a recent study published in the American Journal of Public Health, cases of black lung are at a 25-year high in Appalachian coal mining states, with as many as one in five underground coal miners in the region having evidence of black lung. In order to address this worsening public health crisis, Senators Manchin and Capito have filed an amendment to the defense, labor, health and education spending package currently under consideration on the floor of the U.S. Senate aiming to improve the participation rate of coal miners in federal health surveillance programs that detect and treat black lung. Specifically, the amendment requires the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to submit a report to Congress on ways to boost outreach efforts to increase participation in the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program CWHSP and to identify barriers that deter miners with black lung from accessing treatment. CWHSP is a national program that offers free health screening services to coal miners, including chest X-rays, lung function testing, respiratory health assessment questionnaires, and extended health surveillance. However, the current national participation rate in CWHSP is approximately 35 percent among active miners and even lower among retirees.  ###",true/false,
24,"COVID-19 has left many struggling to pay rent, but Asheville resident Rachel Atkins is facing a different housing challenge: She was told she had to pay a full 12-month lease in advance because of her job in the service industry. Atkins, who works at a downtown restaurant, has been trying to find a house and move in with her partner. They found a property at 74 Livingston St. and scheduled a viewing on June 22. The house was perfect, and within an hour, they had submitted an application with WNC Property Management, which oversees the rental. The next morning, Atkins received the following email from WNC Property Management: “Since your employment is in the service industry, and many businesses in the service industry are currently struggling, closed or potentially closing in the near future, you would be required to prepay your 12-month lease in advance.” Atkins offered to send previous pay stubs and a letter from her employers verifying her job. But that wasn’t good enough. “[W]e are in very challenging and uncertain economic times, and there is a good chance that many businesses in the service industry will be closing over the next 12 months,” a response from the property managers read. BACK AND FORTH: Atkins received the following email message from WNC Property Management after submitting an application for a house at 74 Livingston St. Screen capture courtesy of Rachel Atkins The bill for the entire 12-month lease added up to $14,400, Atkins said. After the property manager said it couldn’t compromise, she posted the exchange to Facebook, prompting hundreds of comments in several locally oriented Facebook groups. “I just feel stressed out about finding a spot to move in,” Atkins said. “It’s already a tricky market without adding in all these layers.” Jim Barrett, executive director of Asheville-based nonprofit Pisgah Legal Services, says that requiring a year’s rent in advance is likely legal. However, he continues, the requirement may run counter to “the spirit of the residential security deposit law.” “This practice probably does not violate the Fair Housing laws because working in a particular job is not a protected class, ordinarily,” Barrett said. “Landlords can discriminate based on credit checks, so I guess landlords can require a prospective tenant to demonstrate ability to pay.” WNC Property Management posted a statement to its Facebook page, saying “rent prepayment is not our company policy across the board for the service industry, as many have jumped to the conclusion. “For this particular property, a [previous] tenant lost their job and was unable to pay rent, and the homeowner is requiring our company to ask all future tenants, where 100% of household income comes from a service industry job, to prepay their rent,” the statement continued. “We are contractually obligated to follow our client’s instructions. “We stand with all those that work in Asheville’s service industry and realize that they are the fabric of our city and regret that our initial response did not reflect this. As a small, locally owned business that has been hit as well, we empathize with anyone that has been affected by these challenging economic times. We have had to shut down the vacation rental management part of our business and have suffered large financial losses as a result.” After receiving multiple comments on that statement, the management group released a subsequent message, which read: “The property in question has been removed from the market as the owner understands some were having trouble meeting a prepaid lease agreement. They understand the difficult time that many are going through right now and in no way wanted to add to anyone’s difficulties. They are now weighing options moving forward, and in the meantime, we have chosen not to relist the property unless it can be offered with no prepaid requirement.” Atkins doubts she will apply for the house in question after her experience but says she is happy other people may now be able to qualify for a home.",true/false,

26,"Earth's atmosphere stretches out to the Moon – and beyond  20 February 2019  A recent discovery based on observations by the ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, SOHO, shows that the gaseous layer that wraps around Earth reaches up to 630 000 km away, or 50 times the diameter of our planet.  ""The Moon flies through Earth's atmosphere,"" says Igor Baliukin of Russia's Space Research Institute, lead author of the paper presenting the results.  ""We were not aware of it until we dusted off observations made over two decades ago by the SOHO spacecraft.""  Where our atmosphere merges into outer space, there is a cloud of hydrogen atoms called the geocorona. One of the spacecraft instruments, SWAN, used its sensitive sensors to trace the hydrogen signature and precisely detect how far the very outskirts of the geocorona are.  These observations could be done only at certain times of the year, when the Earth and its geocorona came into view for SWAN.  For planets with hydrogen in their exospheres, water vapour is often seen closer to their surface. That is the case for Earth, Mars and Venus.  ""This is especially interesting when looking for planets with potential reservoirs of water beyond our Solar System,"" explains Jean-Loup Bertaux, co-author and former principal investigator of SWAN.  The first telescope on the Moon, placed by Apollo 16 astronauts in 1972, captured an evocative image of the geocorona surrounding Earth and glowing brightly in ultraviolet light.  ""At that time, the astronauts on the lunar surface did not know that they were actually embedded in the outskirts of the geocorona,"" says Jean-Loup.  Cloud of hydrogen  The Sun interacts with hydrogen atoms through a particular wavelength of ultraviolet light called Lyman-alpha, which the atoms can both absorb and emit. Since this type of light is absorbed by Earth's atmosphere, it can only be observed from space.  Thanks to its hydrogen absorption cell, the SWAN instrument could selectively measure the Lyman-alpha light from the geocorona and discard hydrogen atoms further out in interplanetary space.  The new study revealed that sunlight compresses hydrogen atoms in the geocorona on Earth's dayside, and also produces a region of enhanced density on the night side. The denser dayside region of hydrogen is still rather sparse, with just 70 atoms per cubic centimeter at 60 000 kilometers above Earth's surface, and about 0.2 atoms at the Moon's distance.  ""On Earth we would call it vacuum, so this extra source of hydrogen is not significant enough to facilitate space exploration,"" says Igor.  The good news is that these particles do not pose any threat for space travelers on future crewed missions orbiting the Moon.  ""There is also ultraviolet radiation associated to the geocorona, as the hydrogen atoms scatter sunlight in all directions, but the impact on astronauts in lunar orbit would be negligible compared to the main source of radiation – the Sun,"" says Jean-Loup Bertaux.  On the down side, the Earth's geocorona could interfere with future astronomical observations performed in the vicinity of the Moon.  ""Space telescopes observing the sky in ultraviolet wavelengths to study the chemical composition of stars and galaxies would need to take this into account,"" adds Jean-Loup.  The power of archives  Launched in December 1995, the SOHO space observatory has been studying the Sun, from its deep core to the outer corona and the solar wind, for over two decades. The satellite orbits around the first Lagrange point (L1), some 1.5 million kilometres from Earth towards the Sun.  This location is a good vantage point to observe the geocorona from outside. SOHO's SWAN instrument imaged Earth and its extended atmosphere on three occasions between 1996 and 1998.  Jean-Loup and Igor's research team in Russia decided to retrieve this data set from the archives for further analysis. These unique views of the whole geocorona as seen from SOHO are now shedding new light on Earth's atmosphere.  ""Data archived many years ago can often be exploited for new science,"" says Bernhard Fleck, ESA SOHO project scientist. ""This discovery highlights the value of data collected over 20 years ago and the exceptional performance of SOHO.""

CDC and FDA physicians review each case report of death as soon as notified and CDC requests medical records to further assess reports.” The website went on to boldly proclaim that a “review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines.” This is important medical editorializing so as not to scare people. The CDC has a vested interest in getting as many people vaccinated as possible, so even when burying the important data about deaths at the bottom of a page intended to assuage concerns over these experimental drugs, they did so with every intention of making people take it.  Of course, the concern over the vaccine is nothing new.  Fox News’ Tucker Carlson has been raising legitimate questions.  However, after a segment last week questioning the vaccine, Carlson’s segment was BANNED from YouTube.  Fortunately, people have been ripping the segment and sharing it online.  Watch it below before Big Tech takes it down again:  On this occasion, full marks to Fox News, but it is obviously an exception.  Carlson makes the point that in 4 months of Covid ""vaccines"", the 3,000+ deaths is greater than with all other vaccines in the previous 15 years. No official investigation!https://t.co/iebMBd30eF — Dr Verner Wheelock (@VernersViews) May 6, 2021  Tucker Carlson on the experimental vaccines pic.twitter.com/IZRtcYlGdx — Rima Kohli (@OrganicQuotient) May 4, 2021  More and more people are raising questions.  As they should.  But similar to the 2020 presidential election, rather than answering these questions with transparency and integrity, people are refusing to talk about the numbers.  Fortunately for us, the numbers speak for themselves.  Conservative commentator David J. Harris, Jr. had this to say:  On Wednesday night’s episode of Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” host Tucker Carlson asked a very important question: “How many Americans have died after taking the COVID vaccines? Not Americans who’ve been killed by the virus, that’s a huge number, but how many Americans have died after getting the vaccines designed to prevent the virus? Do you know the answer to that question? Do you know anything about the downside? We know a lot about the upside of the vaccine. We’ve been completely in favor of vulnerable people taking vaccines.” With our federal government teetering on the edge of going full authoritarian concerning getting the COVID vaccine, do you know all the risks involved? President Joe Biden was on television Tuesday talking about vaccines, about how he wants us all to get one. In fact, everyone with authority wants you to get the COVID vaccine and they are starting to apply enormous pressure for people like me who have been holding out to get the shot. The Biden administration has said that they won’t force COVID vaccine passports or anything like that but when he said that Dr. Fauci also indicated, or was it a dog whistle, to institutions and corporations that they would start using some form of a COVID vaccine passport to let you into the building or use their services. You may not be able to fly on an airplane or go to work or even educate your children if you don’t get the vaccine. Friends and family members may tell you that you’re not welcome at their homes or events if you have not yet been vaccinated. Okay, so a lot of you are contemplating on getting the vaccine because you don’t want to have to deal with the immense pressure being applied on you, but before you get that shot, do you know anything at all about the possible risks of getting the shot? You probably don’t know what I’m about to tell you, and you should know because it’s your life we’re talking about. People don’t normally associate vaccines with causing serious problems, even fatalities, because vaccines for the most part are not dangerous, at least according to the numbers. About 160 million Americans get the flu shot each year, as do I, proving that I am not an anti-vaxxer. I just have questions about the COVID vaccine that I can’t really find too many people to answer. Tucker said, “Every year, a relatively small number of people seem to die after getting those shots. To be precise, in 2019, that number was 203 people. The year before, it was 119. In 2017, a total of 85 people died from the flu shot.” Out of 160 million people who get the flu shot, those numbers of people who died, every one of them being tragic to their loved ones, aren’t significant enough for the rest of us to consider not getting the flu shot. Carlson wanted to know how many people have died from getting the COVID vaccine: “We checked today. Here’s the answer, which comes from the same set of government numbers that we just listed: Between late December of 2020, and last month, a total of 3,362 people apparently died after getting the COVID vaccines in the United States. Three thousand, three hundred and sixty-two — that’s an average of 30 people every day. So, what does that add up to? By the way, that reporting period ended on April 23. We don’t have numbers past that, we’re not quite up to date. But we can assume that another 360 people have died in the 12 days since. That is a total of 3,722 deaths. Almost four thousand people died after getting the COVID vaccines. The actual number is almost certainly much higher than that — perhaps vastly higher.” [emphasis added] GET THE TRUTH: DailyTruthReport.com How come no one is talking about that? Do doctors and other medical personnel now instinctively know that you’re not supposed to talk about anything that violates the Woke Supremacy’s stance on COVID? This is our lives we’re talking about.  These are legitimate questions.  And these are serious concerns.  So why aren’t our “leaders” more willing to be transparent?  If they really want to earn the trust of the American people, perhaps they should begin with full transparency and integrity to the public.  Public health is at stake!",true/false,
29,"The NHS will be off the table in any US-UK trade negotiations, the government said on Monday as it set itself limited ambitions for a future trade deal with Washington.  Publishing its mandate for negotiations, the government appeared to bow to public pressure not to accept US farming methods, although trade experts said the British position left a small amount of wriggle room on shifting agricultural standards.  The NHS will not be on the table. The price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table. The services the NHS provides will not be on the table, the 184-page mandate says, allaying fears that a US trade deal would push up UK drug prices.  David Henig, the director of the UK Trade Policy Project at the European Centre for International Political Economy thinktank, said the negotiating objectives for a US trade deal were relatively modest and appeared designed to tick the box of a deal rather than deliver substantial gains.  They reflect concerns at the heart of government that a comprehensive deal is not economically worth the likely political trouble from farmers and environmental campaigners among others, Mr Henig said.  The government said it estimated the benefits of signing a US-UK trade deal would range from 0.16 per cent of additional GDP in 15 years at the upper end, down to 0.07 per cent of GDP if the deal liberalised trade less than hoped.  The US-UK objectives were released in London as a team of more than 100 UK trade negotiators opened talks in Brussels to try and seal a deal on the future EU-UK relationship before the December 31 deadline. The UK is seeking a Canada-style deal with the EU, which Treasury analysis estimates will lead to the British economy growing by 4.9 per cent less than would have otherwise been the case.",true/false,

Almost three quarters of first-time buyers 72 per cent cited paying the upfront cost as more difficult than raising a deposit 69 per cent or making monthly mortgage payments 34 per cent. And 60 per cent of FTBs say paying no stamp duty would make them more likely to buy their own home, according to Yorkshire Building Society research. Saving enough to pay stamp duty adds to the overall difficulty of buying a home Andrew McPhillips The tax – paid from already taxed income for simply changing your address – is charged when people buy a home. Currently nothing is paid if he property bought is less than £125,000, but two per cent is charged on the portion up to £250,000. Five per cent is then charged up to £925,000, 10 per cent up to £1.5m and 12 per cent on anything above that. So a house bought for £275,000 comes with a bill of £3,750 made up of zero per cent on the first £125,000, then two per cent on the next £125,000, equaling £2,500 and five per cent or £1,250 on the final £25,000. Now the Yorkshire is calling on the Chancellor to swap the payment of the tax from the buyer to the seller in tomorrow’s Autumn Statement. The Society estimates such a reform would save first-time buyers in the UK excluding Scotland, an average of £3,791, with Londoners saving the most at an average of £13,171. But other experts, such as the TaxPayers’ Alliance would like to see the tax scrapped completely. John O’Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: “Stamp Duty is a bad tax which not only distorts the housing market by adding an extra cost on already unmanageably high house prices but also affects labour mobility by preventing people from taking up jobs across the country, worsening our productivity as a nation.

Play slideshow Paul McGovern 1 of 11 There’s nothing to stop a post-Brexit Government giving £100m more a week to the NHS but other areas also require funding “As it is now clear that the new reforms introduced by the previous Chancellor only worsened the matter with added complexities while only raising half as much money as the Treasury predicted, Phillip Hammond must do the right thing and abolish this pernicious tax in the Autumn Statement.” Almost two in three aspiring homeowners would be more likely to buy if they didn’t have to pay stamp duty, according to the UK’s second largest building society. Sixty per cent of aspiring homeowners said paying no stamp duty would make them more likely to move, with 22 per cent saying it would not make a difference and the remaining 18 per cent answering ‘don’t know’. The research showed that 18 per cent of potential first time buyers were not saving anything towards buying a home, and a further 52 per cent saving less than £250 per month. GETTY More than half first time buyers would be more likely to buy a home if stamp duty was axed The Society argues this highlights the significance of stamp duty acting as a barrier to people achieving their homeownership aspirations. It has urged the Government to include examining the switch in stamp duty as part of its formal submission on what should be included in Mr Hammond’s financial plans for the UK. Andrew McPhillips, chief economist at Yorkshire Building Society, said: “Saving enough to pay stamp duty adds to the overall difficulty of buying a home. “It’s hard enough for buyers to find the right property in the right location without the need to pay additional fees and taxes, given the scale of house price inflation in recent years. “The Government’s Housing White Paper will rightly outline plans to resolve the crisis faced by those unable to buy a home. GETTY Paying stamp duty was more difficult than raising a deposit for 69% of respondents “But these will be long-term ambitions and measures to ease the problems in the short-term, including reforming stamp duty, should form part of the Government’s strategy. “Reducing any of the costs such as stamp duty for first time buyers and those moving up the ladder would help to make homes more affordable for many, enabling more people to realise their homeownership aspirations.” According to another new study, the Chancellor needs to cut the housing tax to stop the North continuing to suffer a “brain drain” as high-skilled British workers leave the region in their thousands.

31,"(Washington, DC) Judicial Watch announced today that it received 1160 pages of documents from Washington, DC’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) related to Air Force veteran and San Diego native Ashli Babbitt. These new documents reveal that OCME submitted a request for permission to cremate Babbitt only two days after taking custody of her body and that ‘due to the “high profile nature” of Babbitt’s case, Deputy Chief Medical Examiner Francisco Diaz requested that a secure electronic file with limited access be created for Babbitt’s records. Additionally, Babbitt’s fingerprints were emailed to a person supposedly working for the DC government, which resulted in Microsoft “undeliverable” messages written in Chinese characters being returned. Babbitt was shot and killed by an unidentified law enforcement officer as she attempted to climb through a broken interior window in the Capitol Building, located outside the Speaker’s Lobby off the House Floor during the January 6 disturbance. She was unarmed. At the time of the shooting, several officers reportedly can be seen in videos, standing in the crowd of protestors in which Babbitt was present. The records were obtained in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit concerning two FOIA requests submitted by Judicial Watch on April 8, 2021 to the Metropolitan Police Department and the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for records related to Babbitt’s death (Judicial Watch v. The District of Columbia (No. 2021 CA 001710 B)). The newly obtained records reveal: On January 8, 2021, at 7:13 p.m., an application to cremate the body of Babbitt is labeled “completed successfully.” Copies of the permit are sent to OCME officials Kimberli Hall and SaVern Fripp, as well as Melinda Smith, Jennifer Love, Lisa Tabron, Jeanette Belle, and Perlieshia Gales. In a January 6, 2021, email sent at 9:48 p.m. from OCME official Denise Lyles to medical examiner Francisco Diaz, the subject line is, “Case #21-00106 ID Confirmed.” [Case 21-00106 was Ashli Babbitt’s file number.] On January 6, 2021, at 9:43 p.m., Lyles emails OCME official Dr. Jennifer Love an attachment with the message, “I am updating the information we received from IAD [Internal Affairs Division] re the confirmed ID for OCME Case #21-00106 [Ashli Babbitt’s case]. These are the prints that returned from the FBI, that the detectives from IAD provided. I dropped them in the e-case file. Their names are noted below.” Lyles appears to have forwarded the file after having received it at 9:33 p.m. on January 6 from someone (whose name is redacted) within the Prince George’s County, MD, Police Criminal Investigation Division, assigned to the “Homicide Unit – FBI/Cross Border Task Force.” The file had been sent to that person at 9:30 p.m. on January 6 from someone with the email address efcon@gmw00001.str0.ngi.cjis. On January 6, 2021, at 7:42 p.m., OCME official Jamie Spann emailed a scanned file called “21-00106 FBI Submission Form” to Grant Greenwalt, Manager of the Crime Scenes Sciences unit of the DC Department of Forensic Sciences, as well as someone with the email address spc@leo.gov, and copying medical examiners Francisco Diaz and Jennifer Love, asking, “Please run the attached prints.” This document contained Ashli Babbitt’s fingerprints. Greeenwalt forwards the request to David Chumbley, an officer of the DC Police Department. Chumbley forwards the prints on from his iPhone at 8:06 p.m. on January 6 to someone identified as Jamese Kororma within the DC government. The email sent to “Jamese Kororma” resulted in multiple Microsoft “undeliverable” messages being returned, written in what appear to be Chinese characters. On January 7, 2021, Forensics photographer Matthew Brown emailed OCME colleagues regarding Babbitt’s case with “High” importance,” stating, “Due to the high-profile nature of case 21-00106, Dr. Diaz has requested limited access to this case. Please create a secure folder on the photo server for case 21-00106 and provide access only to the following OCME staff: Dr. Mitchell, Dr. Diaz, Anna Francis, Matthew Brown.” Brown adds, “Currently there are no images or folders on the photo server for this case. The images are being held on the OCME archiving server until a secure folder is created.” Michael Coleman, OCME’s Chief Information Officer, responded two hours later, “The requested directory has been created with the stipulated access granted. Please let me know if any additional adjustments are required.” Brown replies, “Thank you Mike. The case photos are now available on the server.” Responding separately to Coleman, OCME Records Manager Anna Francis says, “I have restricted the e-case file as well. For work purposes, the following groups have access, please let me know if permissions should be limited further: 1. Anna Francis; 2. MLI Investigations; 3. Medical Examiners; 4. Michael Coleman; 5. Roger Mitchell; 6. QC-n-RecMgmt; 7. Investigators.” In a January 14, 2021, email from Deputy Chief Toxicologist Stephen Raso to OCME colleague Samantha Tolliver with the subject “Capital Riot Cases,” Raso states, “See attached prelim results.” In a February 2, 2021, email from OCME official Andrea Pugh to medical examiner Dr. Francisco Diaz, Pugh indicated that the preliminary toxicology report on Babbitt was completed. On January 13, 2021, Dr. Francisco Diaz emailed Chief Medical Examiner/Deputy Mayor Roger Mitchell with the note, “21-00106: COD-Gunshot wound to left anterior shoulder. MOD-Homicide.” Note: COD is “Cause of Death” and MOD means “Manner of Death.” The OCME did not release cause and manner of Babbitt’s death until April 7, 2021: Ashli Babbitt, 35 years old: Cause of Death – Gunshot wound to the left anterior shoulder Manner of Death – Homicide In a January 8, 2021, email, Lead Forensic Investigator Rebecca Wood tells OCME officials, “I spoke with the family for the above case and her legal last name is ‘Babbitt.’ CMS has been updated to reflect this change, please update the death certificate as well.” In a January 8, 2021, email sent at 3:45 p.m., OCME official Denise Lyles messages her OCME colleagues with the subject “Capitol Incident Cases,” and notes “FYI, all the cases from the Capitol Incident all Identifications have been confirmed,” adding, “Ashli Elizabeth Pamatian aka A. Babbitt – partner/husband notified.” The records include identification records for “Ashli Elizabeth Pamatian,” including a copy of an FBI fingerprint submission card, a State Department visa check record “for identification purposes,” and a separate FBI fingerprint submission card that indicated that the “Official Taking Fingerprints” in the Babbitt case was “E. Betts.” Additionally, Babbitt’s body was listed as “Unidentified female” and “WF.” The DC government form included in the records states: “The District of Columbia Office of Chief Medical Examiner has recovered human remains and is requesting AFIS fingerprint database searches for identification purposes,” and the “transaction type” on the form indicates “Unidentified Deceased (DEU Transaction). The comments section notes, “Please attempt to identify this unidentified female who was discovered deceased on 01/06/2021 in Washington, DC.” The form asks the response to be faxed to OCME. official Jennifer Love. An X-ray log sheet indicates that three “LODOX” images of Babbitt’s body were taken by a technician with the initials RK. In an email on January 18, 2021, Deputy Chief Medical Examiner Francisco Diaz sends an attachment with Babbitt’s case file number to OCME officials Kristina Giese and Kimberly Golden stating, “Please review this homicide.” In an email on March 1, 2021, OCME official Cheryle Adams messaged colleagues Beverly Fields and Dr. Francisco Diaz (copying Mayor’s office spokeswoman Olivia Dedner), advising them that she was providing an updated spreadsheet of reporters seeking information on the people who died at “the January 6, 2021, Insurrection at the Capitol. “There is intense public interest in the shooting of Ashli Babbitt at the Capitol on January 6,” stated Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “The continued secrecy and delayed release of information about the shooting death of Ashli Babbitt are suspicious and smacks of politics. That Americans still have no information about who killed her or any police report about her death is a scandal of epic proportions.” The Metropolitan Police Department has not yet responded to Judicial Watch’s FOIA request. This document release is part of Judicial Watch’s ongoing investigation into the January 6 disturbance. In March, Judicial Watch filed a FOIA lawsuit against the District of Columbia for documents about the death of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick. Pressure from this lawsuit helped lead to the disclosure that Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died of natural causes. Judicial Watch also filed lawsuits for U.S. Capitol Police emails and video related to the riot and for Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s communications with the Pentagon in the days after the January 6 incident.",true/false,

33,"The Center For Disease Control and the federal government is adamant that pregnant women get a COVID-19 injection.  But data doesn’t support its safety and health practitioners around the world are sounding the alarm.  A Canadian doctor, who has effectively treated COVID patients with Ivermectin throughout, urges pregnant women to abstain from getting the COVID injections.  Speaking to a reporter in November, Dr. Daniel Nagase argues COVID vaccines are directly attributed to an alarming increase in stillbirths across Canada.  TRENDING: EVIL: SNL 'Jokes' About Gang F***ing Roger Stone's 75-Year-Old Wife Who Has Cancer (VIDEO)  Doulas who work in women and children’s hospitals in one of the birthing centers for Vancouver “had 13 stillbirths in a 24-hour period,” Nagase contends.  “In Waterloo, Ontario, I have a more reliable statistic,” he continued. “There were 86 stillbirths between January and July. Normally, it’s only five or six stillbirths every year. So, about one stillbirth every two months is the usual rate. To suddenly get to 86 stillbirths in six months, that’s highly unusual,” he continued. “But the most important confirmation that we have from the Waterloo, Ontario report was that all of the 86 stillbirths were fully vaccinated.  “We are seeing a correlation and certainly when you see a correlation, you have to start asking, ‘In the water in Waterloo, is there something? Is there something in the air? Is there some toxin in the food supply? But when you see the same correlation in different parts of the country – in Vancouver and then in Waterloo, and you see an increase in stillbirths. You have to ask yourself what is going on that is both in Waterloo, Ontario and Vancouver that is suddenly causing an increase in stillbirths?”  Taxpayer-funded hospitals must be held accountable, Nagase argued.  “We need to get Freedom of Information Requests. We need doctors, nurses, unit clerks at hospitals to start printing out the statistics because we know if we ask the health authorities to print out the statistics they will refuse and that is absolutely criminal because who pays for the hospitals? We do. It is our information– we own that information,” he said. “We should not be asking some administrator for permission to get the death statistics. We should not have to ask some kind of health minister for permission to get the actual rate of [intensive care unit] stays. They’re saying it’s ‘unvaccinated people,’ but there are so many people who are within 2 weeks of their second shot and they getting deathly ill. This information is our information.  “We deserve to know how many percent of the ICU is filled with people who are having side effects within one week of the injection. And then, if they are clogging the ICUs because they are getting a vaccine injury, but then they’re being labeled as unvaccinated, that is an absolute lie.”  On Nov. 30, Dr. Nagase and Dr. Mel Bruchet launched an investigation into Lions Gate Hospital in North Vancouver to verify why claims alleged by doulas about the influx of stillbirths among COVID-vaccinated mothers.  “Nagase launched an official complaint with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police against executives at the College of Physicians & Surgeons of BC, alleging conflicts of interest influencing their policies, decisions and statements made to the people of British Columbia,” Fox 26 reports.  The CDC maintains there is no increased risk of miscarriages among those who’ve been vaccinated, however, the former Pfizer vice president Dr. Michael Yeadon has corroborated the claims made by Nagase and a multitude of health practitioners underfire for warning against COVID injections.  “We never, ever give experimental medicines to pregnant women,” said Yeadon warned in August during a “Stop the Shot” conference hosted by Life Site News. “You never, ever give inadequately tested medicines, medicinal products, to a pregnant woman. And that is exactly what is happening. Our government is urging pregnant women, and women of childbearing age, to get vaccinated. And they’re telling them they’re safe. And that’s a lie because those studies have simply not been done.”    Yeadon, who holds degrees in biochemistry, toxicology, and a Ph.D. in respiratory pharmacology and launched his own biotech company after working in the pharmaceutical industry for 32 years. The former Pfizer executive called attention to a Japanese study that found high concentrations of the spike protein in the ovaries when tested on mRNA vaccine injected rats.  “What we find is the vaccine [in rats] doesn’t just distribute around the body and then wash out again, which is what you’d hope,” he said. “It concentrates in ovaries of rats, and it concentrates at least 20-fold over the concentration in other background tissues like muscles.  “You don’t want this product in your ovaries. It’s simply not necessary to induce immunity to have a vaccine in your ovaries. And, as it’s concentrating in the ovaries, getting higher concentrations over time, they have not even defined what the maximum levels are or when that occurs.”",true/false,
34,"It has been nearly three decades since the topic of global warming, and then climate change came on the scene as a hot (pardon the pun) topic on the pages and screens of our news media. Most people have taken sides as to whether or not humanity plays a role in determining the temperature of our planet. Whichever side you choose, it may not matter because the majority of the people will make the final decision. This decision making majority is not into the climate change debate for personal gains, political power, or social rewards. It is out of a genuine concern to do the right thing for humanity, their children, and all life on earth. Yet many are ambivalent, confused about the science or lack thereof to support one opinion or the other confidently. I believe that most are concerned with the least important factors rather than the most accurate answers. Let’s first establish that climate change is most definitely real. We all know that in the past, there were ice ages and wooly mammoths. We know about the heat of the dust bowl years of the 1930s pictured in the famous movie The Grapes of Wrath. Here I plan to give you the major vital factors that cause the climate to change. I choose to divide the controlling factors into four groups, leaving last those issues with which the reader is likely most familiar. The first group is related to the planetary orbit of the earth around the sun. The closer the earth is to the sun, the warmer it will be on earth. We learned in grade school that the earth is 93 million miles away, orbiting around it once a year. But this orbit is not always the same but is A very fresh look at climate change 1always changing. At times, the orbit is almost perfectly round; then, over thousands of years, it elongates and looks like a stretched out pancake, which we call an ellipse. Figure 1. About every 100,000 years, the sun makes a complete shift from this maximum elliptical shape when the earth goes as much as 120 million miles away to a near-perfect round shape. Then the earth is only 83 million miles away and it starts all over again, back to elliptical. This changing distance between the earth and the sun makes a big difference, which results in a change in our climate. Picture yourself at a campfire sitting 9 feet from the fire and then moving to a place 7 feet from the fire. That is the same ratio the earth experiences moving between 83 million miles and 120 million miles. The second factor that figures in the climate change story is the tilt of the earth relative to the sun. Presently this tilt is 23.7 degrees shown in Figure 2, but again things are always changing. The northern hemisphere of the earth will slowly tilt more towards the sun then slowly starts tilting back away from the sun. But after 40,000 years, it will be back to the tilt we see today. Within those 40,000 years, the tilt can range between 24.5 and 22.7 degrees. The tilt is significant as it determines winter, spring, summer, and fall and what their temperature ranges are likely to be. A very fresh look at climate changeThe third group of factors that impact the earth is contained within the sun itself. The sun undergoes very complicated and powerful magnetic cycles from high activity to low activity. It is easy to tell the difference from here on earth. When the activity is high, we see lots of spots on the sun. When we see few or even none, we know the activity levels are low, as can be solar radiation. Scientists have been carefully counting these spots for hundreds of years since Galileo got his first telescope. With satellites and advanced telescopes, NASA gets a count every day and also measures how big or small they are. As we see in Figure 3, scientists discovered without a question that these events go up and down in clear 11 year cycles. Believe it our not astronomers have recorded 24 such cycles in the past 250 years. Presently we are at the end of a cycle with near-zero sunspots. NASA has confirmed in recent years that increasing sunspots are linked to increases in earth temperature as well as the other planets, like Mars and Saturn, and even the moons. Essentially, none of the factors in these three groups are seriously considered in the alarmist views. They tell us that we are the primary forces controlling earth temperatures by the burning of fossil fuels and releasing their carbon dioxide. I hope my readers can recognize the absurdity of their claims. Now to the final group 4, the factors that logically and recognizably play a role in climate change. It is these variables that climate modelers try to use to create equations that supposedly tell us about how our climate will change for the coming decades. These factors are easy to understand but mostly impossible to predict. They include such things as the impact of clouds, the role of sea ice and glaciers, hurricanes and tornadoes, vegetation, the balance between the earth’s water, water vapor and ice, as well as the energy, flows between the oceans, the land, and the air. With these tools and methods, we can predict the weather for the next few days, maybe even weeks away. Surely they can’t predict the weather a year away, let alone decades into the future. I hope this short tutorial on the big climate change picture will make you more skeptical. After all, that’s the first responsibility of all real scientists, run experiments, gather data put together a theory then have as many experts try to shoot it down as best they can. The output of computer models is not data. Instead, these models are used to justify the nonsense they try to tell us that; life on earth will end in a dozen or so years along with their other ridiculous predictions for the future.",true/false,

But, the poll found, Clinton has a 10-point lead among those likely to vote next week, primarily due to support from older voters. Sanders has continued to close the gap between him and Clinton and has been campaigning hard across the state. “Bernie Sanders has tapped into a wellspring of support in the Democratic primary over the last several weeks and he’s closing with a rush,” said Dan Schnur, director of USC’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, which partnered with the L.A. Times to conduct the poll. ""If Clinton manages to hold him off and win the primary, it would be as a result of a low turnout that tilts the electorate in her direction."" Sanders has barnstormed California in recent weeks, hoping to grab a large share of the state's 475 pledged delegates up for grabs. However, if primary results are as close as recent polls indicate, Sanders and Clinton would split the 475 delegates evenly, which wouldn't give the Vermont senator much of a boost in his search for the nomination. Clinton leads Sanders in the pledged delegate count 1,769 to 1,501. When superdelegates, the unbound party leaders who vote at the July convention, are factored in, the former first lady's lead blossoms to 2,313 and puts her just 70 delegates short of the Democratic nomination, according to The Associated Press delegate tracker. Sanders has pledged to fight up until the Democratic National Convention to convince superdelegates to flip and hopes a convincing win in California will help. The Los Angeles Times poll is just the latest to show it will be a close race for the two Democratic candidates. A Field poll released Thursday morning showed Clinton leading Sanders by just 2 points, 45 percent to 43 percent, among likely Democratic primary voters. And a NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Wednesday similarly shows Clinton and Sanders within 2 points of each other: Clinton leads Sanders 49 percent to 47 percent in that poll. The LA Times poll surveyed 1,500 voters from May 19-31 and has a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points. That included 903 Democratic voters, with a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points, and 503 likely Democratic voters, with a margin of error of 5 points.",true/false,

37,"Arthur Roberts, the 83-year-old C-List actor who portrays Joseph Biden on television and in person, blew his cover during a televised press conference with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier this week. In a stunning scene seen by many, Biden’s (RRN uses the term ‘Biden’ to stand for either Biden or his body doubles) handlers abruptly and seemingly without cause ushered the press pool from the White House Briefing Room while Johnson tried to field questions from British journalists in attendance.  The stunned press pool protested as security forcibly ejected them, clueless as to why they, the administration’s MSM allies, were being rudely told to leave.  On Wednesday, Jen Psaki, who is currently under military investigation, said the room was cleared because Johnson’s questions were not preapproved, but a whistleblower in the fake administration’s communications office revealed to RRN what actually transpired during the surreal briefing.  As reported previously, it is RRN’s contention that the real Joseph R. Biden has not been seen in public since shortly after the 2020 presidential election. The reason is that, in early February, he suffered a massive stroke that left him brain dead and hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he has lain comatose ever since. Biden’s Deep State handlers had had high hopes for Kamala Harris, and had intended that she would succeed him, but it soon became apparent that she lacked fortitude and the mental acuity needed to coalesce the liberal base. Much to her chagrin, she was put on the backburner while the Deep State sought body double replacements who could play a convincing Joe Biden.  One such find was Arthur Roberts, an obscure 80s actor whose capstone cinematic achievement was playing the evil ninja, Braden, in the 1984 martial arts flick Revenge of the Ninja. After that, he faded into obscurity, henceforth obtaining only minor roles in film and television productions, until the Deep State grabbed him as a potential Biden replacement in early March.  Roberts, no spring chicken himself and older than the genuine Biden, apparently has a touch of dementia, which caused him to veer off script and raise suspicion in the eyes of Boris Johnson.  In a moment not caught on microphone and spoken softly enough for the press pool to not overhear, Roberts began lamenting to Johnson his failed film career, and he asked the UK Prime Minister whether he had seen the films Little Miss Magic and Up in Smoke, in which he had minor roles.  A theatrically masked Boris Johnson, our source said, discretely muted his microphone and spoke softly in Roberts’ direction, asking, “You’re not Joe Biden. Who the bloody hell are you?”  “Even though he muted his mic, Jen Psaki and White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield were in another office, and able to overhear the entire discourse through hidden parabolic mics in the briefing room. They, how should I put this, freaked the fuck out. They began screaming into Roberts’ hidden earpiece to get back on script or read only from the teleprompter. That’s when Roberts silenced his own mic and told Boris he was only joking around. But Psaki feared the situation would deteriorate, and she immediately ordered the room cleared,” our source said.  He added that a bewildered Johnson later asked Psaki “what the hell just happened,” and was told to forget the entire incident, unless the UK wanted to lose all U.S. support.

38,"Introduction  Many conservatives have been confused by John Roberts’ decisions as Chief Justice of SCOTUS. On decision after decision, he has followed the line of thinking common to the radical left. Yes, we have Kavanaugh, Alito, Thomas, Gorsuch, and now ACB on our side and that is great. But Roberts was appointed by Bush. He was supposed to be a conservative justice. Why has he not acted like it, especially recently? One potential reason is that it might be true that John Roberts visited Epstein’s island.  Now, I’m not a conspiracy theorist. Yes, I’m concerned about the brazen voter fraud in the election, especially the votes Biden received from non-citizens. Yes, I think the Hunter Biden emails are real and I think Biden might have worn a wire during the first debate. And no, I don’t think Epstein killed himself. But, other than the wire, those aren’t really conspiracy theories. They are things that happened. I think the same is true of me saying that John Roberts visited Epstein’s island. I might be wrong, but the evidence is damning.      Think your mask is completely useless, just like John Roberts? Mad at your governor’s Covid policies?

Become one here: Patreon Donation Link  What We Know: It Sure Looks Like Justice John Roberts Visited Epstein’s Island and Might Have Been or Still Could Be Blackmailed  For those that have been living under a rock, it came to light a few years ago that Jeffrey Epstein had an island in the Caribbean where he took elites to have sex with children. Various famous and prominent men, namely Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew, visited frequently. Hollywood elites, such as Kevin Spacey, also visited.  The main theory about that island and Epstein’s wealth is that, in addition to just being a sick and twisted individual, Epstein blackmailed the people he brought to the island. Perhaps he did that for money, perhaps for fame, or perhaps for power. The “why” isn’t known yet and probably won’t be until Ghislaine Maxwell’s trial.  But what we do know is that Epstein brought famous and influential individuals to his island and had ample evidence with which he could blackmail them. One of those individuals might have been Chief Justice Roberts; it does look like Justice John Roberts visited Epstein’s island and could have been blackmailed to make bad SCOTUS decisions. Here’s the evidence.  Piece of Evidence #1: The Flight Log  To determine who visited “pedo island,” one key piece of evidence has been the flight log. For example, a flight log from 2009 showed that Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey and Naomi Campbell visited the island. You might remember that Kevin Spacey was accused of harassing a minor and there is ample evidence that Clinton and Prince Andrew also had inappropriate relations with minors.  Now, one interesting name on that list is a John Roberts. Here is what Lin Wood had to say about the idea that John Roberts visited Epstein’s island and was on the flight manifest:  Additionally, there is this image of the flight log. If you view the circled area, you will see that a “John Roberts” signed it:  Now, there are, of course, potential refutations of that. Just because Lin Wood said so and there appears to be a flight log that shows so does not mean that Chief Justice John Roberts visited Epstein’s island.  For one, the image could be faked. I completely understand that and want everyone else to too. I don’t have a copy of the flight log, so I can’t independently confirm it. However, the image does appear to be real and has not, to my knowledge, been discredited as of yet.  The other believable refutation is that the “John Roberts” listed is not the Chief Justice of SCOTUS. Both “John” and “Roberts” are common first and last names, so there could be another that was on the so-called Lolita Express.  But Epstein didn’t mingle with normal people. He only brought the elite of the elite to his island, and Chief Justice John Roberts is undoubtedly the most famous and influential “John Roberts” out there. Given the record of who Epstein brought to the island, it is likely, if the image is real and Lin Woods is right, that the John Roberts in Epstein’s flight log is Chief Justice John Roberts.  Piece of Evidence #2: Tapes and Pictures Appear to Show that John Roberts Visited Epstein’s Island  According to one whistleblower about the heinous crimes of Epstein and his guests, Chief Justice John Roberts visited Epstein’s island and can be seen in the Epstein tapes. Here is what one site, Penns Word, had to say:  “A whistleblower who allegedly works in the federal circuit revealed a Supreme Court justice was seen in various “Epstein tapes” that were recently recovered by investigators: “One of the SCOTUS [justices] is in the Epstein tapes that were recovered yesterday. I’m sure you can guess which one. “The shocking part is the canary is telling the feds a certain nation state has been blackmailing this gentleman since prior to his nomination to SCOTUS. “What does this mean? This justice was hand picked at the highest levels specifically because he was being controlled via blackmail. A sheep in wolf’s clothing appearing to be which he is not. “Cat is out of the bag… or I should say almost.”’ From: https://www.pennswordtwo.com/article/did-supreme-court-justice-john-roberts-just-get-fileted-by-the-epstein-tapes.html  Perhaps that whistleblower is lying. Or, perhaps, they’re telling the truth and John Roberts did appear at Epstein’s island. Lending credence to that view is an image that has leaked from those tapes. Here it is the others who are allegedly in the photo are, from left to right, Richard Cheaz, Bill Clinton, George Nader, and Tony Podesta:  This image is the clearest piece of evidence that John Roberts visited Epstein’s island  For reference, here is a picture of John Roberts from his swearing in that presents a similar profile:  Swearing in of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.  Again, the image could be fake. Someone could have photoshopped John Roberts into the image. Or, it could be a real image with someone other than Chief Justice John Roberts in it. However, that doesn’t seem to be the case. Other than the haircut, the profile appears to be about the same. The nose, in particular, is strikingly similar, as is the general shape and profile of the face.  So, based on the whistleblower’s testimony and a leaked image, it does look like John Roberts visited Epstein’s island.  Conclusion: It Sure Looks Like John Roberts Visited Epstein’s Island  When the flight log, whistleblower testimony, and leaked image are all viewed, it is hard to not reach the conclusion that Chief Justice John Roberts visited Epstein’s island. Personally, I think the evidence is convincing, although I recognize that the images could be fake and the testimony made up.  But, if real, it would point to why John Roberts has made the decisions he has made since appointed. He has avoided contentious issues when possible because of blackmail or because he fears being in a situation where he could be blackmailed. When it came down to how to vote, he voted to the left because that’s what whoever blackmailed him told him to do. In short, it would appear that John Roberts is compromised and can’t be trusted to enforce constitutionality. He’ll just keep doing what his handlers tell him to do.

39,"As news and misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic has spread, many Americans have encountered conflicting narratives about how the new coronavirus originated. Scientists have determined the virus came about naturally, but there is some uncertainty about how it first infected people.  While a plurality of Americans (43%) say the new coronavirus most likely came about naturally, nearly three-in-ten (29%) say it most likely was created in a lab, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted from March 10 to 16, 2020, as part of the Center’s nearly yearlong Election News Pathways project.  Around a quarter of adults (23%) say it is most likely that the current strain of coronavirus was developed intentionally in a lab; another 6% say it was most likely made accidentally in a lab. A quarter say they aren’t sure where the virus originated.  To explore the extent to which misinformation has made its way into the news people get about the COVID-19 outbreak, we focused on the belief of some Americans that the virus was created in a lab. We used data from a survey of 8,914 U.S. adults conducted March 10 to 16, 2020, as part of the Center’s nearly yearlong Election News Pathways project. All survey participants are members of the Center’s American Trends Panel, a nationally representative online survey panel. Panelists were recruited by telephone or mail so that nearly every U.S. adult has a known chance of being selected. The data is weighted to further ensure it reflects the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Here are the questions asked for this report, along with responses, and its methodology. Visit our interactive data tool to access the data on the coronavirus pandemic and other issues related to news and the election.  Americans differ by age, education level and race and ethnicity when it comes to who believes that the virus was created in a lab:  Younger adults are more likely than older people to say the virus was developed in a lab. For example, about a third of adults ages 18 to 29 say the virus was developed in a lab (35%), compared with 21% of adults 65 and older. Nearly four-in-ten (39%) adults under 30 say it came about naturally, while 51% of those 65 and older say this.  Educational attainment is also a factor. Those with a bachelor’s degree or more education are less likely than those with a high school diploma or less education to say the coronavirus was created in a lab (19% vs. 35%). A majority (61%) of those with at least a bachelor’s degree say the virus came about naturally, compared with 31% of those with a high school diploma or less.  The belief that the coronavirus was created in a lab also is more prevalent among Hispanic and black Americans than among whites. About four-in-ten Hispanic adults (39%) say the virus was created in a lab. Among black adults, 34% say the same. Around a quarter of white adults (26%) say it was developed in a lab.  When it comes to political affiliation and ideology, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely than Democrats and Democratic leaners to say the coronavirus was created in a lab (37% vs. 21%). About four-in-ten conservative Republicans say this (39%), the largest share of any ideological group.  Confusion surrounding these facts parallels Americans’ overall experience with misinformation during the outbreak. About half of U.S. adults (48%) report having come across at least some news and information about COVID-19 that seemed completely made up, with 12% saying they have seen a lot of it and 35% saying they have seen some.  Note: Here are the questions asked for this report, along with responses, and its methodology.",true/false,
40,"Following in the footsteps of his mentor, Barak Hussein Obama, Joe Biden is preparing to cower to the Iranian Caliphate in the form of a $3 trillion apology for the Trump administration’s assassination of their top General, Qassem Soleimani.  While the assassination was celebrated by democracies worldwide, Democrats in the US accused Trump of showboating, resulting in raised tensions with the Muslim country.  The continuous funneling of cash from US taxpayers to Iran between the Obama, and now Biden administrations, is shameful. While our veterans lay homeless on our streets and our corporations are being threatened with higher taxes, Democrats have decided to fund a known enemy to the US.  This is the very definition of treason. Not even bleeding heart Jimmy Carter sank so low in his dealings with Iran.  The jet, handpicked by Biden’s Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, is a Dassault Falcon 8X. While the Dassault made its name in the military and commercial aircraft space, the larger Falcon jets carved out a niche in the business space due to their impressive range 5,950 nautical miles, a digital flight control system, and an ability to customize the plane’s interiors into 30+ formats depending on usage priorities.  With the versatility to make both long-range and short-range trips courtesy of a tri-jet engine, the Falcon models offer speed, efficiency, and improved comfort. Sources tell us there will be a handwritten note from Biden on top of the cash that will simply say, “Enjoy the cash. Keep the Jet.”  Due to its payload, this flight will take on a particular significance in aeronautic history. It will be the most valuable payload ever transported by aircraft. To bear this grave responsibility, Bilken enlisted retired US Airways pilot Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, famed pilot depicted by the legendary Tom Hanks in the 2016 blockbuster hit “Sully”.  Sullenberger insisted his longtime personal flight steward Andres Esquer be along for the all-important flight. Esquer famously served an entire Boeing 777 full of rowdy Oasis fans two cocktails each from one single liter of vodka on an international flight from Heathrow to JFK in 1998, a feat that is still mentioned during pillow talk amongst flight attendants and pilots to this day.  He is certified in CPR and BJJ. He is also an amateur pilot, more than capable of manhandling the aircraft should anything unfortunate befall Sully.  The offer of cash as an apology only serves to lessen our standing in the world. The only silver lining here is that it is being delivered by the best America has to offer.",true/false,
41,"Authorities are slowly tightening the noose again around the necks of the British public in response to an alleged new Covid-19 variant dubbed Omicron that is feared may evade the current available Covid-19 vaccines. The problem with this is official data shows the alleged Delta variant has been evading the Covid-19 vaccines for at least the 3 past months, because since August 2021 the fully vaccinated have accounted for 9 in every 10, Covid-19 deaths.  Public Health Scotland (PHS) publish a weekly report on Covid-19 statistics which includes data on cases, hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status.  The report includes data over a period of four weeks and the latest statistics were published by PHS on December 1st 2021, including data on cases and hospitalisations from 30th October to 26th November 2021, and data on deaths from 23rd October to 19th November 2021.  By analysing the data contained within the report alongside data from previous reports that stretches as far back as August 14th 2021, we can see that Scotland has very much been experiencing a ‘Pandemic of the Fully Vaccinated’ since at least August.  Proving the introduction of new restrictions has nothing to do with the worry that the new Omicron variant may impact the effectivenes of the Covid-19 vaccines, and instead has everything to do with control, because the jabs have proven to be ineffective for months.  Covid-19 Cases  Table 19 of the latest ‘Covid-19 Statistical Report’ shows the number of Covid-19 cases per week by vaccination status. We’ve created the following chart on the published data from several reports, including the most recent published December 1st.  As you can see from the above the unvaccinated population accounted for the majority of cases every week between August 21st and September 17th, but since then the fully vaccinated have accounted for the majority of cases every week. However, by including the number of cases among the partly vaccinated population we find that the vaccinated population have in fact accounted for the majority of Covid-19 cases since at least August 21st.  The above chart shows the cumulative number of cases per week by vaccination status between August 21st and November 26th. Here we can see that something significant happened in the week beginning 16th October in regard to the number of cases accumulating among the unvaccinated and fully vaccinated populations, in that the number of cases were beginning to fall among the unvaccinated whilst increasing significantly among the fully vaccinated.  Official data shows that between August 21st and November 26th there were 142,945 cases among the unvaccinated population, 30,204 cases among the partly vaccinated population, and 165,008 cases among the fully vaccinated, bringing the total number of cases among the vaccinated population in this time frame to 195,212.  Covid-19 Hospitalisations  Table 20 of the latest ‘Covid-19 Statistical Report’ shows the number of Covid-19 hospitalisations per week by vaccination status. We’ve created the following chart on the published data from several reports, including the most recent published December 1st.  As you can see from the above the data proves that it is the fully vaccinated population who have been putting a strain on the healthcare system and not the unvaccinated as the authorities and mainstream media would have you believe.  The above chart shows the cumulative number of hospitalisations per week by vaccination status between August 21st and November 26th, in which there were 2,531 hospitalisations among the unvaccinated population but more twice the among among the vaccinated population, who recorded 6,094 hospitalisations.  Covid-19 Deaths  Table 21 of the latest ‘Covid-19 Statistical Report’ shows the number of Covid-19 deaths per week by vaccination status. We’ve created the following chart on the published data from several reports, including the most recent published December 1st.  The data shows that the fully vaccinated have accounted for the vast majority of Covid-19 deaths by a long way since at least August 14th. In the past four weeks along there were just 59 deaths among the unvaccinated population whilst 407 deaths occurred among the vaccinated population.  This means the vaccinated population accounted for 9 in every 10 Covid-19 deaths between October 23rd and November 19th.  The above chart shows the cumulative number of deaths per week by vaccination status between August 14th and November 19th, in which there were just 219 deaths among the unvaccinated population, but 1,280 deaths among the vaccinated population.  This data suggests that the fully vaccinated are 144% more likely to die once hospitalisated with Covid-19 based on the hospitalisation/fatality rates that can be calculated from the statistics.  With 2,531 hospitalisations and 219 deaths among the unvaccinated population this equates to a hospitalisation/fatality rate of 8.6%.  But with 6,094 hospitalisations and 1,280 deaths among the vaccinated population this equates to a hospitalisation/fataity rate of 21%.  Pandemic of the Fully Vaccinated  The data available from Public Health Scotland stretching back 14 weeks proves very much that this is a pandemic of the fully vaccinated, and with the vaccinated accounting for 6 in every 10 cases (57%), 7 in every 10 hospitalisations (70%), and 9 in every 10 Covid-19 deaths (85%) since at least August, this also proves that the Covid-19 vaccines have already been ineffective for months.  Therefore any restrictions enforced in the name of protecting the public from the alleged new Omicron variant have absolutely nothing to do with protecting your health, and instead everything to do with control.",true/false,
42,"U.S. Special Forces arrested former President George W. Bush Saturday morning at his Crawford, Texas, ranch following a blistering firefight with Secret Service agents and private security contractors assigned to protect him.  On Friday evening, a Special Forces “Alpha Detachment” stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, received from U.S. Army Special Operations Command orders to infiltrate the ranch and arrest the 43rd president. SF were told to expect resistance because recent intelligence on the ranch showed that Bush had surrounded himself with armed private security contractors in addition to the trio of Secret Service agents that routinely patrolled the grounds.  Transportation to the ranch was provided by the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, nicknamed Night Stalkers, a group of highly skilled chopper pilots that conduct transport, attack, assault, and reconnaissance missions, at night, at low altitude, and on short notice. The choppers had to make 3 refueling stops to reach their destination.  Under cover of darkness early Saturday morning, the choppers descended into a clearing near the southeast corner of Bush’s 1,600-acre ranch, far from the staff trailers and the main house where they hoped to find Bush sleeping. After offloading SF, the choppers ascended into the night to await a call for exfiltration.  A military source familiar with the mission told Real Raw News that Special Operations Command had obtained detailed satellite imagery of the property as well as locations of trail cams that live-streamed to a communications bunker 100 yards from the main building.  “Intelligence estimated that Bush had 20 security contractors and 3 Secret Service on the property. The plan was to exploit blind spots in the surveillance cameras, ingress to the main building, subdue Bush’s personal guards, and drag him to the exfil point without alerting the larger security force. But something went horribly wrong,” our source said.  Special Forces had approached to within 200 yards of the main house when all hell broke loose.  Two open-top ATVs, each with a driver and 3 security personnel, sped out of the darkness and toward the encroaching SF unit, the headlights momentarily illuminating the soldiers as they separated into groups and dove for cover. Bush’s security unleashed a hailstorm of suppressive fire, wounding one soldier and killing another. While one SF group engaged the enemy, the other dashed toward the main house, hoping to capture Bush before he could be evacuated on his own private helicopter, which sat parked near the main structure.  “The battle turned in our favor quickly. SF took cover behind a rock wall and with the aid of NVGs shot out the tires on both vehicles and then killed or grievously wounded Bush’s security. But they knew there was still at least a dozen patrolling the property and they would’ve been alerted and on their way. Time was of the essence,” our source said.  The second SF unit reached the main house just as 2 Secret Service agents emerged and began steering Bush, still in his pajamas, to an armored limousine parked alongside dense shrubbery. SF instructed them to halt and throw up their hands, but the agents wheeled around and drew weapons, only to be killed a second later.  Somewhere on the property a deafening klaxon blared like an air raid siren.  “They gagged and bagged Bush, then regrouped. They couldn’t make the exfil point, not with one KIA and a teammate with a sucking chest wound. They radioed for pickup where they stood. A pilot told them that enemy forces were mobilizing near the staff trailers, and they had only minutes to get out of there. The birds weren’t armed for combat; otherwise, they could’ve hosed down those trailers,” our source said.  The choppers touched down only long enough to retrieve SF and their package, avoiding further conflict.  Our source said that JAG and the Office of Military Commissions had long sought Bush’s arrest. He did not say why it waited so long or why it felt such an impetus to grab Bush Saturday morning. Bush, he said, has been charged with treason and is being held to account for the deaths of thousands of soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan and for his role in masterminding 9/11, in addition to other crimes.  “He will face a military tribunal,” our source said.

43,"Military cadets at West Point Academy who refuse to take one of the controversial COVID vaccines are being put in solitary confinement, with more stringent restrictions than those who tested positive for the virus.  At West Point Military Academy, a number of cadets are currently rebelling against the push from the Biden administration and military higher-ups to take one of the controversial COVID-19 vaccines. 700 cadets who initially refused the vaccine were brought together into a meeting room, and were briefed as to the benefits of the vaccine. The number of cadets has now dwindled significantly after allegations of daily pressure by “senior officials” at the school, and rumors of reductions of leave. Some cadets relented and received the vaccine, while many left West Point due to the pressure.  Those who still refuse to take the vaccine are forced to wear masks everywhere, marking them out from everybody else who is vaccinated. A number of parents of those holdouts have now organized legal counsel on behalf of their children, with CDMedia reporting that they are “banding together to fight this perceived criminal behavior by those in power over their children.  ADVERTISEMENT  An anonymous whistleblower, whose identity National File is protecting, gave a breakdown of the current restrictions that West Point cadets who refuse to take the COVID vaccine have to face. For those cadets returning for summer programs, they will have their two week leave shortened to one, as they have to spend 7 days in a quarantine that amounts to serious solitary confinement. The cadets are locked up for 23 hours each day in one room, and are only allowed out for one hour to walk or run outside.  Crucially, these cadets are not tested for COVID-19 before they are put into self-isolation. In fact, they are only tested at the end of the period. If they test negative, they will be released to their training programs. In a letter sent to the cadets deemed “high risk,” there was no detail as to what would happen if the cadet tested positive instead, in terms of whether they would be forced to endure another week or more of the solitary confinement. National File contacted West Point for details on this program via phone and email, but did not receive a response by the time of publication.  ADVERTISEMENT  The new regime could not accurately be described as self-isolation or quarantine, as such programs already existed at West Point for cadets returning after the summer and Christmas breaks this academic year who tested positive. For those cadets, before the vaccination program kicked into high gear, they would be restricted at some points, but could also work out in the outside gyms, and leave their accommodation to go and order food, albeit being ordered to stay away from cadets who were not infected. These luxuries are not afforded to the cadets who refuse to take the vaccine, even though they may not have the virus.  West Point allegedly plans to round up all the cadets who are refusing the vaccine and transfer them into all one company or platoon based on how many they’re are. At the time of writing, around 50 cadets have not backed down. The whistleblower said this would likely be better for them, as they would not be around other troops who derogatorily shout at them, calling them “anti-vaxxers,” and instead would be with those who stand with them. “They’re being treated like criminals,” the whistleblower added. “They’re trying to protect other people’s rights and their rights are being compromised.”  National File reported last year on two successive suicides from the Colorado Springs Air Force, with students expressing to the academy that the deaths may have been linked to depression springing from the then extremely strict social distancing policies and punishments for violating the six-foot distance protocols. Following the deaths, looser restrictions were enacted.",true/false,
44,"A thorough marketing campaign for the use of low-quality masks has convinced millions of people that masks will reduce COVID-19 spread, but do they really?  State governments are enthusiastically mandating that everyone, even those who aren’t sick, wear masks when in public. While that might seem like a logical and even patriotic thing to do, what does the science actually say about mask efficacy and safety?  Top Doctors Initially Acknowledged Masks Don’t Work  In the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak, Dr. Anthony Fauci told us masks probably weren’t going to help protect us from the Wuhan virus. Joe Biden’s COVID-19 adviser Dr. Michael Osterholm similarly agreed that wearing masks is “largely” nonsense and that “trying to stop the flu [another respiratory virus] is like trying to stop the wind.”  These expert opinions were based on a meta-analysis of multiple studies about masks on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s CDC’s website. It concluded, “We did not find evidence that surgical-type face masks are effective in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission, either when worn by infected persons source control or by persons in the general community to reduce their susceptibility.”  Fauci and Osterholm were also likely aware of numerous studies concluding that masks during surgery don’t prevent wound infections from particles doctors emitted from their mouths and noses. One study found that tracer particles placed on the inside of a surgeon’s mask ended up in the surgical wound.  Another study in Clinical Orthopedics blamed redirected airflow, saying, “The wearing of a surgical face mask had no effect upon the overall operating room environmental contamination and probably work only to redirect the projectile effect of talking and breathing.” Most recently, a September 2020 meta-review concluded, “Surgical mask wearing among individuals in non-healthcare settings is not significantly associated with reduction in acute respiratory illness incidence in this meta-review.”  Much Recent Pro-Mask Research Is Deeply Flawed  The only statistically significant data on preventing viral spread is for N95 masks worn indoors when one can’t socially distance, which is not the type of mask required nor typically worn by the general public.  In favor of a few new, poorly designed studies, government leaders are ignoring the previous solid research that clearly demonstrates the typical cloth masks don’t work. The researchers in these new inferior studies somehow conclude that masks help, but you have to read the fine print: They have an unrealistic experimental design, confounding variables, and a “low certainty” of evidence.  Speaking of fine print, while the World Health Organization WHO recommends masks to the public, it acknowledges elsewhere, “At the present time, the widespread use of masks by healthy people in the community setting is not yet supported by high quality or direct scientific evidence.”  One analysis published in the well-known medical journal The Lancet concluded masks help, but the study subjects wore masks along with all other protective health measures, meaning the contribution of masks to the study result can’t be conclusive. To its credit, it rated its evidence on masks as “low certainty,” yet this study is held up as “proof” that masks work.  Other studies, such as one from Nature, had participants blow into a tube or a box while wearing and not wearing various masks. If fewer particles were emitted from the front of the mask, researchers deemed that mask to be effective. That would be great, except measuring only the forward projection of particles completely misses the aerosols that escape from the edges of the mask. A person’s fogged glasses are a clear demonstration that masks do little to contain aerosols. Masks simply “redirect airflow,” as the Clinical Orthopedics study stated.  Another “definitive” study put rats in adjacent cages separated by a small hole completely covered by a new, dry mask. This experiment does not come close to approximating the effectiveness of the moist, bacteria-laden masks people wear in public, which leak aerosols out of the edges. Comparing masks covering rat air holes to those covering human faces is comparing apples and oranges.  All of these studies also used fresh masks only for a few minutes. The authors acknowledge that when masks get moistened by breath, they might allow for increased emission of viral particles. Indeed, it has been well demonstrated that masks accumulate microorganisms.  Finally, in one case study, a pair of COVID-19-infected hairdressers worked with masks, and their clients didn’t become ill. While this case is also widely viewed as proof masks work, important details were ignored.  First, many of the hairdressers’ clients declined to get tested, so we don’t know if they contracted COVID after contact with the hairdressers. Second, the clients who were in contact with the stylists when their viral load would have been highest were not included in this case study. Third, the hairdressers obviously had mild cases, otherwise they wouldn’t have been able to nor allowed to work.  When did the science bar get so low, especially for something forced on the entire population?  Are Masks Actually Causing Harm?  “Maskne,” face rashes, “mask mouth,” and sore throats point to bacteria building up in masks due to the humid, stagnant air and changes in the oral microbiome, which can cause systemic inflammation and downstream disease. A 2015 study found that health-care workers who wore cotton face masks suffered from significantly more respiratory illness than those who wore surgical masks.  Previous research conducted by Fauci himself found that the main cause of death in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic was from bacterial pneumonia. Inhaling higher bacterial counts with every breath sounds like an especially bad idea.  The WHO specifically recommends against wearing a mask while exercising because “masks may reduce the ability to breathe comfortably. Sweat can make the mask become wet more quickly which makes it difficult to breathe and promotes the growth of microorganisms.”  Abundant research demonstrates masks cannot help prevent the spread of coronavirus, while much recent research claiming to support masks is weak and poorly designed. Frequent mask use by the general population increases bacteria and dust in our mouth and airways. A government mandating that everyone wear a mask based on such low-quality evidence is reckless and potentially harmful.  For now, let’s stick with the measures that do help: social distancing, hand hygiene, and avoiding chronic disease. Only don a fresh, clean N95 mask for short periods of time when you’re unavoidably close to others indoors.",true/false,
45,"In September 1959, Nikita Khrushchev became the first Soviet leader to visit America. It was a remarkable event and a seminal moment in the Cold War. Born in 1894 the son of poor peasants in Russia, Khrushchev’s life charts what is arguably the most dramatic period in Russian history, straddling the First World War, the 1917 February and October revolutions, the 1918–1922 civil war that ensued thereafter, the upheavals of the 1920s, followed by the five year plans and purges of the 1930s. It also takes in the Second World War and the post-Stalin period, a period in which Khrushchev was personally and politically central with his infamous 1956 ‘secret speech’ to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union CPSU in Moscow. Read more For a leader whose political career was closely bound up with Stalin’s, the speech was considered by some to be an act of treachery – a cynical attempt to salve his own conscience by distancing himself from the brutal excesses of his predecessor. Others considered the speech courageous and necessary, beginning the thawing out of a sclerotic political culture within the upper echelons of the Party and government that was incompatible with the times, thus allowing the country and its people to breathe more easily. Regardless of the whys and wherefores, what cannot be gainsaid is that Khrushchev’s peasant background and homespun style belied a leader who was willing to take risks at home and also on the international stage. He well understood the crucial distinction between doctrinal purity that looks good on paper and policies that pass the all important test of being applicable to real world conditions, ensuring that he could never be accused of being a prisoner of fixed ideological positions. The fruits of such a worldview were never more evident than in a foreign policy defined by the objective of peaceful coexistence with the West. And it is here we return to a fascinating episode in the history of the Cold War, when the Soviet premier, at President Eisenhower’s invitation, embarked on a two-week tour of the US on 15-27 September 1959. Khrushchev, in his multi-volume memoirs, left behind a treasure trove of personal reminiscences and recollections of the tour. With refreshing candour, he confesses that when the invitation to visit the US arrived it took Moscow by surprise. “We had no reason to expect such an invitation,” he writes. “Our relations had been extremely strained… America had been boycotting us completely… and now, suddenly, this invitation. What did it mean? A shift of some kind? It was hard to believe.” His sense of pride at the shift in Washington’s stance towards the Soviet Union, though, is unabashed: “We’d come a long way from the time when the United States wouldn’t even grant us diplomatic recognition. We felt pride in our country, our Party, our people, and the victories they had achieved. The main factors forcing the President [Eisenhower] to seek improved relations were our economic might, the might of our armed forces, and that of the whole socialist camp.” Read more A revealing insight into the culture within the Soviet leadership is provided by the wrangling that took place over who should be part of the delegation to the US: “The question came up of whether or not to take our wives. When Bulganin and I went to Geneva and London, we left our wives at home. Leaving them behind was one of our legacies from Stalin’s time. Stalin was very suspicious of anyone who took his wife on a trip with him… In general, we had always considered it unbusinesslike – and a petty-bourgeois luxury – to travel with our wives.” At the time of Eisenhower’s invitation, Khrushchev’s leadership was beset by crises at home and abroad. His previously mentioned speech to the 20th Congress of the CPSU, beginning the process of de-Stalinization, had the unintended consequence of catalysing anti-Soviet sentiment across the Eastern bloc, most explosively in Hungary. Meanwhile, the Cold War had got the point where it was more than justified to hold to the belief that World War III was a question of when, not if. In this context, a visit to the United States brought with it the opportunity to alleviate tensions between East and West that were pregnant with risk. Khrushchev’s abiding pride in the achievements of the Soviet system was manifest as soon as the Tu-114 aircraft bringing him to the US on a non-stop flight from the Soviet Union touched down in Washington and the Americans lacked stairs of sufficient height to reach the door. “They hadn’t known our plane was such a giant. We could see wonder in their eyes as they looked at it. They’d never seen anything like it, and they certainly didn’t have anything like it themselves, nor would they have one for a long time.” Apart from the series of talks the Soviet delegation held with their US counterparts on various subjects and matters of common interest, the tour took in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Pittsburgh, before culminating in private talks with Eisenhower at the President’s Camp David retreat. Khrushchev’s recollection of a dinner held in his honour during his visit to Los Angeles, bringing together the city’s most wealthy and influential dignitaries, is revelatory: “The meal was delicious and lavishly served,” he writes. “No sour cabbage soup for these people.” Read more But things took a decidedly negative turn when the city’s mayor addressed the dinner and in the course of his remarks insulted the Soviet Union. Khrushchev felt compelled to respond in kind in his own address to the assembled guests: “Mr Mayor, ‘I said,’ “I’m here as a guest of the President. I didn’t come to your city to be insulted or to listen to you denigrate our great country and our great people. If my presence is unwelcome, then my plane is always ready to take me straight back to the Soviet Union.” Khrushchev’s meeting with the head of the US auto workers’ union, Walter Reuther, provides another fascinating insight into the worldview of a man who’d been reared in the belief that communism heralded the future. “I studied Reuther closely… here was a man who had betrayed the class struggle… He made as much money [as head of the union] as the directors of the biggest American corporations, like Ford. In other words, the capitalists had bought him off.” Ultimately, the attempt to achieve a breakthrough in US-Soviet relations over the course of the tour failed. “I could tell Eisenhower was deflated,” Khrushchev writes. “He looked like a man who had fallen through a hole in the ice and been dragged from the river with freezing water still dripping off him.” But no matter, at least this son of Russian peasants was able to take comfort in the fact that getting ready to fly back to the Soviet Union with the rest of his delegation, the Americans “still hadn’t found a set of proper stairs high enough for our Tu-114.” Though the tour failed to produce the outcome sought by both leaders, it is testament to the political courage of President Eisenhower that he reached out and invited his Soviet counterpart to visit the country during a period of extreme hostility within Washington to Moscow. Indeed it is arguable that without his prolonged visit to the US in 1959, Khrushchev may not have been so willing to accommodate JFK during the Cuban Missile Crisis three years later in 1962 – the reason being that only in visiting the country or countries of his adversaries is a leader able to humanise it beyond the realm of geopolitical differences. In 2018, due to the unbounded anti-Russia fever that has Washington in its grip, it is highly unlikely that any such visit to the US by Russian President Vladimir Putin will be taking place anytime soon, nor to Russia by his US counterpart, President Trump. In this respect at least, the hard lessons of the twentieth century have been lost. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!",true/false,
46,"Hollywood elites “eat whole babies for Christmas” according to Jim Carrey, who warns “dark forces” are “engaged in a battle for America’s soul“, and the outcome of this battle will have “long-lasting consequences for the entire world.“  “These kids are fattened up for the Christmas table like geese and turkeys, except the animals don’t go through the ritual abuse, the psychological torment that these kids are forced to suffer.“  “These people believe the more the child has suffered, the better it tastes.

It’s a Hollywood thing influenced by old school Satanism.“  Speaking at a post-screening Q&A for documentary Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond in New York, Carrey said that Christmas and New Year are a time of year he dreads, because of the “dark energy pulsating around Tinsel Town” and his knowledge of “what goes on behind the closed doors of the elite at this time of year.“  “Luciferians in Hollywood turn Christmas into the darkest festival of the year,” Carrey said, before explaining “there is a reason why people around the world feel a heaviness at this time of year.“  “Institutional oppression and Satanism hang in the air while we are all forced to wear smiles and ignore the gut feeling that all is not well.”  “Ever notice how all the homeless children you see throughout the year begin to dissapear at Xmas? You think it’s because they’ve found a home, found shelter, found love and warmth?“  “Christmas time is Satanic slaughter time.

47,"Editor’s note: This is the fourth in a series about how branches of the military hate on each other. We’ll feature all branches of the U.S. military, written by veterans of that branch being brutally honest with themselves and their services.  The branches of the U.S. military are like a very large family. They deal with one another because they have to, not because they always get along.  The differences don’t stop at uniforms. Each branch has its own goals, mission, and its own internal culture. At the upper levels of the services, they compete for funds and favor from civilians in DoD. In the lower ranks, they compete for fun and favor from civilians in bars and strip clubs especially in North Carolina. The branches are like siblings, competing for the intangible title of who’s “the best” from no one in particular.  “The Soviets are our adversary. Our enemy is the Navy.” —Gen. Curtis LeMay, U.S. Air Force  Of course, when it comes to joint operations downrange, a lot of that goes out the window. But when the op-tempo isn’t as hectic and frustration has time to build, the awesome Army platoon who saved your ass last month become a bunch of damn stupid grunts who steal everything you don’t lock down and leave their Gatorade piss bottles everywhere. Parsing out the best and worst of our services isn’t hard if we’re honest with ourselves.  Here’s how the other branches hate on the Navy, how they should actually be hating on the Navy, how the Navy hates on the Navy, and why to really love the Navy.  The easiest ways to make fun of the Navy  Sailor harassment has its roots in the age-old reality that since man first decided to put military power to sea in ships, those aboard those ships were forced to spend weeks and months underway before being afforded a few days of downtime in a foreign port. As a result of this ratio, sailors may have had a tendency for exuberance while on liberty over the years. And that exuberance may have caused a scuffle or two that caught the attention of bar owners and other locals who may have developed impressions that were less than positive.  Over time these locals spread rumors that these sailors couldn’t hold their liquor and tended to burn through what little cash they had in a short time. Word of these phenomena returned stateside, which gave birth to the saying, “spending money like a sailor on liberty.”  Because sailors spend time on the water, service members from other military branches wanted to give them a nickname that was both sufficiently pejorative and germane. Naturally marine life came to mind. “Sharks” was too cool and tough and “guppies” was too cute, so they settled on “squids.” So if you want to make fun of a sailor call him or her a “squid.” They really hate that because squids are spineless and ugly and otherwise devoid of personality. They can swim fast, but nobody really cares about that.  Because SEALs. In the wake of the Bin Laden raid, SEALs have managed to morph from silent professionals to the warfare specialty that is quick to tell all to land book and movie deals.  Because Top Gun. No other military movie in history has done more to give the public the wrong idea about what it means to serve. And it’s got a lot of homoerotic imagery, which leads to . . .  . . . The quickest way to strike a squid’s nerve is to make “gay” jokes. Yes, you know the kind, “100 sailors go out, 50 couples come back,” or “it ain’t gay if it’s under way,” and many, many more. It also doesn’t help that sailors are a popular gay fantasy.  Henri Belolo created the Village People around macho male stereotypes that gays fantasize about. The cowboy, cop, construction worker, leather-clad biker, Indian, and the sailor. The band became popular, moved into the mainstream and took the sailor in the cute Crackerjack uniform along with it. Yes, we said “cute.” Admit it, the sailor dress uniform has more in common with the Japanese school girl uniform than with the other service branches.  Not that there’s anything wrong with being gay, of course. This is, after all, the post-DADT world.  Because nuclear power. While the introduction of this science gave Navy ships the ability to sail a long, long time without refueling, the existence of it also created a zero-tolerance culture that has raised the bar of fun suppression to heights that can never be lowered. And this ability to sweat the load has crossed over into other warfare specialties and other branches of the military. Thanks, Nukes . . .  Why to actually hate the Navy  Every service tries to imitate the Marine Corps when it comes to celebrating its birthday, and the Navy’s history makes this in many ways the biggest joke which is a polite way to say “the biggest lie”. While the Navy uses October 13, 1775 as the birth date, they leave out the fact that the first version of the U.S. Navy was dismantled completely after the Revolutionary War because the ragtag bunch of vessels they managed to assemble on the fly did little to protect ports or disrupt the British in any way.  John Paul Jones kicks some British butt. Congress appreciated it so much they dismantled the Navy after the war.  And this anti-Navy sentiment in and around DC lasted a while after that. Thomas Jefferson hated the idea of a standing Navy and few in Congress thought any differently about it. It wasn’t until early Navy badass Stephen Decatur decided to take a couple of ships to Tripoli to raise some Yankee hell against the Barbary Pirates. His successes made lawmakers take notice and actually warm to the idea of a standing Navy, and one with an over-the-horizon outlook.  Decatur Boarding a Tripolitan Gunboat. Painting by Dennis M. Carter  So the real birth date of the Navy would be somewhere around 1810 when Decatur took the USS United States up and down the east coast to show the American public what they had in terms of seagoing capability.  Hate SAPR training and the CYA leadership atmosphere you’re currently serving under? Blame the Navy.  All the mechanisms that surround using the military as a social experiment and other morale-sapping things that get labeled as “politically correct” started with the Tailhook Scandal in the early ’90s. Of course, sexual battery, never mind harassment, is a bad thing that should never be tolerated, but Navy leadership over the years has done little to stop agenda-based over-corrections that have marginalized the culture in undesirable ways in the eyes of those who intimate they know about warfighting and such.  So, regardless of your branch, if you feel like you’re serving in a nanny state, blame the Navy.  Because Jimmy Carter. He’s a Naval Academy grad and a submariner, but he never really acted like it when he was Commander-in-chief. His “man is inherently good” naivete made for some very bad foreign policy, most notably in how he de-fanged the CIA and emboldened the Iranian government to take Americans hostage for 444 days. And the Desert One rescue attempt was a disaster. Basically his time in the White House made the country very happy to see Ronald Reagan.  And because the Navy is the absolute worst when it comes to changing uniforms. Remember aviation greens? How about service dress khaki? No? Well, here’s one for you: aquaflage. What are you hiding in, the water? And if a sailor is in the water don’t you want to be able to see him or her? We rest our case.  Because they wrecked most of what was cool about the band Godsmack and made them corporate sellouts.  Because sailors don’t have to eat MREs when they deploy. Ships are built with mess decks and Navy cooks and supply officers generally take pride in serving the crew good food.  Why to love the Navy  Because Navy SEALs. They popped OBL and the Somali pirates and many more high value bad actors since 9-11. Their warfighting skills are second to none.  Because Hollywood remains enamoured by Navy life, it keeps teeing up Navy-themed shows like “The Last Ship,” and as a result, the general public has a favorable opinion of the military.  Because strike warfare. As has been the case throughout history U.S. Navy carriers and surface combatants were the first on the scene after 9-11, and because of that we were able to take it to the enemy a mere three weeks after the homeland was attacked.  Because the U.S. Navy really is, as the commercials state, “a global force for good.” From Hurricane Katrina to the Haitian earthquake to the tsunami in Thailand, when a country needs humanitarian assistance, the Navy has always been first on the scene.

U.S. Navy photo by Capt. Paul Duncan  Because the Navy continues to fight “the war between the wars.” The Navy goes to potentially hostile places like the littorals of Yemen and Chinese-claimed islands to prove to those nations that we’re willing to protect the sea lanes to keep goods moving safely to and from our shores.  And the Navy also gets to show Jessica Simpson how to shoot a machine gun!  H/t: SB and OV",true/false,

Governments love crises because when the people are fearful they are more willing to give up freedoms for promises that the government will take care of them. After 9/11, for example, Americans accepted the near-total destruction of their civil liberties in the PATRIOT Act’s hollow promises of security.It is ironic to see the same Democrats who tried to impeach President Trump last month for abuse of power demanding that the Administration grab more power and authority in the name of fighting a virus that thus far has killed less than 100 Americans.Declaring a pandemic emergency on Friday, President Trump now claims the power to quarantine individuals suspected of being infected by the virus and, as Politico writes, “stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease.” He can even call out the military to cordon off a US city or state.State and local authoritarians love panic as well. The mayor of Champaign, Illinois, signed an executive order declaring the power to ban the sale of guns and alcohol and cut off gas, water, or electricity to any citizen. The governor of Ohio just essentially closed his entire state.The chief fearmonger of the Trump Administration is without a doubt Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. Fauci is all over the media, serving up outright falsehoods to stir up even more panic. He testified to Congress that the death rate for the coronavirus is ten times that of the seasonal flu, a claim without any scientific basis.On Face the Nation, Fauci did his best to further damage an already tanking economy by stating, “Right now, personally, myself, I wouldn’t go to a restaurant.” He has pushed for closing the entire country down for 14 days.Over what? A virus that has thus far killed just over 5,000 worldwide and less than 100 in the United States? By contrast, tuberculosis, an old disease not much discussed these days, killed nearly 1.6 million people in 2017. Where’s the panic over this?If anything, what people like Fauci and the other fearmongers are demanding will likely make the disease worse. The martial law they dream about will leave people hunkered down inside their homes instead of going outdoors or to the beach where the sunshine and fresh air would help boost immunity. The panic produced by these fearmongers is likely helping spread the disease, as massive crowds rush into Walmart and Costco for that last roll of toilet paper.The madness over the coronavirus is not limited to politicians and the medical community. The head of the neoconservative Atlantic Council wrote an editorial this week urging NATO to pass an Article 5 declaration of war against the COVID-19 virus! Are they going to send in tanks and drones to wipe out these microscopic enemies?People should ask themselves whether this coronavirus “pandemic” could be a big hoax, with the actual danger of the disease massively exaggerated by those who seek to profit – financially or politically – from the ensuing panic.That is not to say the disease is harmless. Without question people will die from coronavirus. Those in vulnerable categories should take precautions to limit their risk of exposure. But we have seen this movie before. Government over-hypes a threat as an excuse to grab more of our freedoms. When the “threat” is over, however, they never give us our freedoms back.",true/false,
49,"Scrambled eggs with jalapeno peppers, and a strawberry milkshake. The last meal of the condemned.  Hillary Rodham Clinton was hanged at Guantanamo Bay Monday night, her death the culmination of an operation that began on March 2 when U.S. Navy SEALs on Donald J. Trump’s authority arrested the disgraced politician at her Chappaqua, NY mansion. After a five-day tribunal at the world’s most infamous detention center, a three-officer panel found Clinton guilty of murder, accessory to murder, treason, child trafficking, and other high crimes. Clinton, who had refused counsel, had uttered nary a word throughout the proceedings, and had taken Vice Adm. John G. Hannink’s sentence of death with an unflinching gaze.  The hanging took place at the Guantanamo Bay courtyard at 9:05 p.m., at once after Taps, which marks the start of quiet hours on U.S. military bases across the globe.  “The world is about to sleep quieter tonight,” Vice Adm. John G. Hannink said to a small assembly that included 3 Joint Chiefs of Staff and, notably, Donald J. Trump, who, garbed in his typical dark suit and crimson tie, had arrived at GITMO earlier in the day. Michael Pompeo and former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani flanked him, both men having played an integral role in amassing evidence against Clinton.  Under military guard, a shackled Hillary Clinton was escorted from Camp Delta detention block to gallows made of steel latticework, with a downward swinging door beneath her feet, that the Army Corps of Engineers had erected in a clearing near Windward Point Lighthouse, on GITMO’s southern edge. Affixed to a steel beam was a rectangular box with five circular, red buttons protruding from the case. In front of each button stood a uniformed soldier. Atop the platform, another soldier slipped a braided noose around Clinton’s neck.  Vice Adm. Hannink addressed the execution detail: “When I say ready, and not one moment before, you will poise your left index finger in front of the button. You will keep it hovered there until I say execute, and then you five must simultaneously press your button. Only one of the five buttons will trigger the door, and none of you will ever know which button that was. Do you understand these instructions?”  “Yes, sir,” the five bellowed in unison.  A chaplain and a physician climbed the 13 steps leading to the top of the platform and stood beside a soldier who was checking to ensure the noose was secure around Clinton’s neck. Below them, Vice Adm. Hannink asked if Clinton wanted last rites or had any final words.  Clinton broke silence. “I’m Hillary Clinton, you can’t do this to me,” she said, her voice a witch’s cackle.  “It’s already done,” Donald J. Trump shouted up at her.  “Ready.” Vice Adm. Hannink nodded at the execution detail.  After a moment’s pause, he gave the “execute” order, the soldiers pressed their buttons, and the grate beneath Clinton’s feet swung open. Her legs and feet, still shackled at the ankles, twitched a moment or two, then stopped.  The rope was cut, and Clinton’s lifeless body lie sprawled in a damp patch of grass. The physician present checked her vitals and declared her dead.  A confidential source involved in Trump’s mission to obliterate the Deep State said the overall mood was somber and melancholy; there was no celebration, no jubilation, just an atmosphere of contentedness, an acknowledgement that what had to be done, was done. The nature of her crimes overshadowed celebratory thought. But a four-decade reign of terror had come to an end.  “As much as Trump hated her, this was purely business. He cares about the children who suffered at her hands more than he cares about what she did to him. Yes, her demise sends a signal to the Deep State. But Trump knows there are many more to go, and he won’t celebrate till the job is done,” our source said.  (Visited 3 times, 3 visits today)",true/false,
50,"There was joy in the air Tuesday, as State Republican Chair Ed Cox and Erie County Republican Chair Nick Langworthy reflected on what they called a great election year for the GOP and an opportunity to change politics - in New York and nationally under President-Elect Donald Trump.  WBFO's Mike Desmond reports  Both chairmen pointed to Trump being a New Yorker who is familiar with Upstate from his travels while considering a run for governor.  Donald Trump performed better than any presidential nominee since Gerald Ford and we found that to be substantial, Langworthy said. He carried towns that haven't gone Republican in years and years in a presidential election. Towns like West Seneca and Hamburg and he won Cheektowaga, a critical town. That means, frankly, that there is cross-over Democratic appeal for his candidacy.  They lost because they did not have a candidate who was a leader, who could have a vision for this country, who addressed the real problems of this country, particularly in the swing states, which were contested and which she lost 48-46, those swing states where there was a real contest going on, Cox said. Donald Trump won because he is a leader and he had a vision for America.  They also pointed to Congressman Chris Collins, his key role in the presidential campaign and his continuing role defending decisions made by the president-elect.  Locally, they also pointed to the way Democratic regions in Erie County turned out to vote Republican this year, a sign of potential future change. Cox also pointed to the election of Chris Jacobs as essential to continuing Republican control of the State Senate.    Holding on to a majority in the State Senate because of Chris Jacobs' win here in Erie County is also historic because, of course, we lost that majority in 2008, Cox said. We lost it again in 2012. In this presidential year, we held on to our majority in the State Senate because of Chris Jacobs' win here.  Cox said it is even more important because a Republican seat on Long Island has possibly flipped to the Democrats. The state chairman said that vote followed the indictment of the Senate candidate's father on corruption charges, something he calls political in bringing the charges close to the election.",true/false,
51,"@chris_najdek  Chris_najdek IG  Cnajdek27@gmail.com  Washington D.C.-    Donald Trump shocked the world when he announced that he and First Lady Melania, tested positive for Covid-19. While many wonder how this happened, Trump feels his failure to wear a mask at a rally he attended is to blame.  While attending a Ku Klux Klan rally in Florida, which somehow has less racists in attendance than most Trump Rallies, Trump forgot to wear his mask.  “My bad, the boys had their mask on and I forgot mine. That’s on me. Remember folks, always wear your mask at these KKK rallies, you don’t want anyone to catch Covid-19, or catch you celebrating white nationalism.” Trump said on Twitter.  When asked by reporters what he was doing at a KKK rally, Trump said:  “I was just going to tell those guys I denounced racism once back in 2017.”  Do you think Chris is funny?

52,"The chant “lock her up” has finally seen fruition.  US Navy SEALS loyal to Donald Trump raided Hillary Clinton’s Chappaqua, NY estate and arrested her on charges of treason, destruction of government property, and aiding and abetting the enemy, Real Raw News has learned.  The arrest happened on Tuesday night, according to a source in Trump’s orbit, only hours after Trump had spoken to Rear Admiral Hugh W. Howard at US Special Operations Command and given him a “mammoth trove” of evidence of Clinton’s criminality dating back to her days at the State Department. The evidence allegedly includes thousands of never-before-seen emails, which Clinton acid washed prior to the 2016 presidential election, as well as documents implicating her in plots to assassinate Republican legislators across the country.  The evidence was so compelling, our source added, that Adm. Howard had trouble believing that Clinton wasn’t arrested years ago.  “Trump’s been wanting to get her, and the rest of the Deep State cabal, ever since he set foot in the White House. It has taken him years to dig up the motherload. Once he had military support, he greenlit the operation. Trump’s team, for lack of a better word, had been surveilling Clinton a long time, and he knew she was always alone on Tuesday nights. That’s when the SEALS nabbed her,” our source said.  Under cover of darkness, an eight-man detachment from Naval Special Warfare Group 3 infiltrated the Chappaqua mansion shortly after 2:00am. Mysteriously, Clinton’s two-man Secret Service detail, which normally lives in a guest house on the property, was absent that morning. The SEALS cleared the main building, then silently breached the door to her bedroom, where they found her awake rehearsing a speech before a vanity mirror. They fired a single tranquilizer dart into her neck, our source said, before taping her mouth and sealing a black cloth bag over her head.  The SEALS also seized several laptops and reams of paper, our source said.  “I don’t know where they took her; only Trump knows that. But this is proof that Trump and the military have started taking out the cabal. It took him longer than expected, longer than he wanted, but better late than never. Trump is doing what’s right for America,” our source said.  Trump will soon send her to Guantanamo Bay to face a military tribunal for her crimes against America and its people. GITMO, our source said in closing, is run by the Marine Corps. and the US Navy, both of which have forsaken Joe Biden and instead pledged to help Donald Trump vanquish the forces of darkness that have enshrouded the nation in corruption for decades.

Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice  Conspiracists are bizarrely claiming the UK could be hit harder by coronavirus because of the rollout of the 5G network, a claim that has been dismissed by scientists.  Currently there are 3,983 confirmed cases of Covid-19 across Britain and Northern Ireland.  As coronavirus has ripped across the globe, a new conspiracy theory has found an eager audience: that the symptoms of the virus - high fever, coughing and shortness of breath - are actually the human body responding to exposure to 5G.  The theory has been shot down by experts, who have pointed out that coronavirus cases have been identified in many areas with no 5G networks.  Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto  Anti-5G critics based in the UK accept the virus likely began in a market in Wuhan and travelled here through human transmission. But they bizarrely believe the 5G networks helps the spread of the virus.  But they're concerned the ultra-fast network currently operating in almost 100 locations around Britain could be helping it to spread more quickly, despite a lack of scientific proof to stand up their unfounded claims.  Activist Louise Thomas, based in Somerset, told Daily Star Online: We can't say 5G has caused the coronavirus, but it might be exacerbating it.  Tanja Rebel, another activist and philosophy lecturer at the Isle of Wight College, told us: Many studies show that Electro-Magnetic Radiation EMR suppresses the immune system and that it helps viruses and bacteria thrive.  So EMR and in particular 5G could act as an accelerator for the disease. We do not know for sure, but common sense and the precautionary principle decree that we urgently need a moratorium on the roll-out of 5G until we can show that it is safe.  Public Health England PHE has publicly stated there is no convincing evidence that exposure to radiation at a level below the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation guidelines will cause adverse health effects.  That safe level is 300GHz, while the level of radiation from 5G will likely only be as high as the tens of GHz.  PHE has been approached for comment on these specific claims from activists.  The new 5G network is being rolled out incrementally across the UK  The “precautionary principle” says that governments and societies should react with caution to anything with the potential to cause catastrophic damage which is not yet well-understood by science.  Italy, now the country with the highest coronavirus death toll, had 5G networks installed in five cities in 2019 with plans to extend coverage throughout 2020. However Iran, which has also been badly affected by the pandemic, has no 5G networks at all, disputing this theory.  A 2011 study from Northeastern University in Boston indicated that some single-celled bacteria, such as E.coli, may communicate with each other using radio waves.  Very little is known about Covid-19, the novel coronavirus at the heart of the current pandemic, but research has shown that viruses talk to each other when making decisions about infecting a host.  Activists are now calling for the government to put a stop to the 5G rollout in what they believe to be the interests of public health, despite repeated assurances from experts that the network radiation poses no threat.  Especially in today's situation it is paramount that we do not play further with lives, Rebel said. Anything else would be deeply reckless.  There have been reports of 5G masts being vandalised and telecoms engineers harassed by member of the public who believe the coronavirus conspiracy theory.  Communications regulator Ofcom has warned this behaviour poses a serious threat to people's safety, adding: We would like to emphasise that there is no relationship whatsoever between 5G mobile signals and the coronavirus.  Vandalism to mobile phone masts mean other services using those masts stop working. These services could include 3G, 4G and mobile call services.  This means people can't call the emergency services or contact their family. It could also mean that some of the communications equipment used by the emergency services is unable to work properly.
