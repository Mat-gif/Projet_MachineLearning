20,"CLARKSBURG — When Jared Henry and Maddie Mansell saw the business property available along Buckhannon Pike in Nutter Fort, they knew just what the community needed there. The building sits right across the street from a park — the perfect location for a coffee and ice cream shop, said Mansell, who now manages Black and White Coffee and Ice Cream in that space. “He always wanted to open a coffee shop and so did I,” she said. Like many small business owners, Henry and Mansell identified a need in the community and took a risk to try to fill it. The addition to the community benefits kids and parents in the area, Mansell said. “It draws everybody in. It gives the teenagers, the kids and families a place where they’re welcome,” she said. Small businesses are the “lifeblood of communities,” according to Nikki Bowmar, public affairs specialist for the West Virginia District Office of the U.S. Small Business Administration. “Small business owners take a risk on an idea, invest in their communities and create jobs,” Bowmar said. “Their skills and creativity not only support their own families, they make neighborhoods vibrant places to live and work and fuel economic strength and growth in the state and across the nation.” There are approximately 114,391 small businesses in West Virginia. Cumulatively, these businesses make up 99 percent of the total number of businesses in the state and employ 280,213 people — nearly 50 percent of the state’s workforce, according to Bowmar. While Mansell does not own the business, she has found employment at small businesses much of her life. As a young teen, her family sold soaps created with supplies from their farm. They later opened a restaurant, she said. For her, though, small businesses provide more than just a job. They allow connections with customers that are not as often cultivated in larger businesses, she said. “What we value, first and foremost, is our customers and people who walk into the door,” she said. “We see them as more than just customers. … We want them to feel like a part of the family, and build friendships, and show them the love we have received in Christ.” Small businesses can also serve as staples within the community, according to George “Gib” Brown, president and general manager of The James and Law Co. James and Law, which sells office furniture and supplies, serves as the textbook depository for West Virginia schools and employs nearly 30 people, has been a fixture in downtown Clarksburg since it formed with the merger of two companies in 1903, Brown said. James and Law is different from other small businesses in that it is a shareholder-held company. People in small businesses have an interest in ensuring their communities are healthy, Brown said. “I see us as kind of a constant. Our officers throughout the years have been involved in the Chamber, the local service agencies, the local church communities. The current officers do the same thing. It’s just a part of the DNA of this company. The company and its employees and officers are integral parts of the community,” he said. The business has also been involved in community development, including helping to provide furniture for the Robinson Grand Performing Arts Center in downtown Clarksburg. “We were really happy to be a part of something like that that we think will bring value to businesses and industry and quality of life in Clarksburg for years to come,” Brown said. Small businesses allow rural communities to be self-reliant and draw upon the resources that are already in the community, including its people, said Dan Taylor, coordinator of the West Virginia Community Development Hub’s Energizing Entrepreneurial Communities program.  The program, in the last of three years, helps four communities, including Grafton, create improved support systems for small business entrepreneurs. Small businesses are a means to economic growth that draws on resources, including the people, that are already in the community, Taylor said. A vibrant and diverse small business community means an area is less reliant on outside forces for providing economic opportunity, he said. “A lot of communities in the state have went through some serious population loss, and I think creating our own small business opportunities is a strategy that will stabilize the population and create employment. It’s also good for the tax base for a community. The more businesses you have, especially local businesses that are paying back into that tax base, will allow a community to be able to fund the infrastructure and the schools that they need. It’s just positive,” Taylor said. They can also draw new residents and tourists, he said. “If you want people to visit the community, you’ve got to have services there — things for people to be able to do, to see, to buy, to eat,” he said. Small business owners take on big risks to invest in their communities. Stephen Mann and his family never had ambitions to be small business owners, but saw it as something that could pull people into Lewis County, spreading the potential benefits beyond themselves and to other businesses in the area. Small businesses also hire people locally, rather than pulling in temporary workers from out of state, he said. In December, he and his family opened MannCave Distilling in Weston. In Mann’s case, it took mortgages on two homes, a substantial loan, most of his savings and one of his 401k accounts to open the distillery serving whiskey, moonshine and vodka. “We’re still not at capacity where it’s paying for itself yet, so it’s still a risk,” Mann said. The Manns do not live in Lewis County, but hope to move to the area once the business takes off, he said. “The reason I chose this particular business is because I will be pulling income from outside of the county into the county and, eventually, outside of the state into the county,” Mann said. “I’m going to be spending a lot of money in Lewis County from what I make.” Small business owners in rural areas like West Virginia face unique challenges. “Another issue rural areas have is finding access to capital to support investments in entrepreneurship, innovation and growth. It can be more daunting in rural areas where there are fewer alternatives to conventional bank loans, relative to urban areas, which have easier access to venture capital, angel investing and emerging crowdsourcing models,” Bowmar said. Mann said he would like to see more state and county support for new small businesses. Development of roads, less regulation of signage and decreased paperwork would help small business owners immensely, he said. Many are working to try to create an environment where small business can thrive. The Energizing Entrepreneurial Communities program leaders in Grafton have worked on downtown beautification projects, planned festivals and encouraged the arts, downtown revitalization and development of outdoor recreation opportunities that can help attract people into the town, Taylor said. A grassroots community effort called All Aboard Grafton is also stepping up to the plate and continuing that work, Taylor said. Taylor County was first in the state in percentage growth of new businesses in February, a sign that efforts are working, according to Patricia Henderson, executive director of the Taylor County Development Authority and administrative support to the Taylor County Commission. “People are wanting to see growth in Taylor County. Young people are willing to work hard and step out in faith that people will support local businesses,” she said. In Weston, a Fairs and Festivals Committee has planned events to support small businesses, according to Mayor Julia Spelsberg. Christmastime is especially busy, when the committee organizes promotions to encourage people to stop into the area’s small stores, she said. “We know all too well the importance of small businesses,” Spelsberg said. “So much of our economy is run on small businesses. In Weston, there’s a ton of small businesses, especially downtown. Small businesses are your family and friends and it’s really important to support them.” Similar efforts are taking place in communities across North Central West Virginia. The Small Business Administration is also trying to help, Bowmar said. The organization “has partnered with USDA to promote rural development, elevate quality of life in rural communities, and ensure small businesses in rural areas benefit from the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, the Historically Underutilized Business Zones and Opportunity Zones programs,” she said. They can also help provide small business owners with capital and technical assistance, she said. “A really important thing that we’ve seen is just sort of changing the narrative about our small towns in the state,” Taylor said. “It’s often a very depressing view we have … and we really want to turn that around and show there’s really a lot of opportunity and we can make our small towns thriving places again. We should celebrate the work that’s happening to do that.”",true/false

71,"""A spokesman for the Soros company, Paid Liberal Trolls of America, says the men and women who signed up were told up-front that they should obey the law and not go to jail: “They were paid for 6 hours at $30 per hour, plus a meal stipend of $40 per day. Add to that a very generous 70 cents per mile for travel and a big cookie, and these people were given neary $1K to be there. All they had to do was go home before curfew. They chose to stay, so they can pay their own bail.” Soros has a bad habit of not paying bail for his protesters, citing case after case of people not showing up for court. “If they don’t show up. we don’t get those funds back, and we can’t write them off as a business expense,” said Attorney Joe Barron, “They should know better than to expect someone as kind as George Soros to just toss an extra $500 per person out the window.” Some protesters might be satisfied with that answer, but most are not. According to their leader, Art Tubolls, the 163 people filing the suit will show at the Soros mansion in Deluth if they have to: “We’re not afraid to protest for real. Charlie Kirk and Turning Point said they’ll fund that endeavor, even if it means he has to bail us out. That guy’s giant head is filled with kindness.”""",true/false

101,"Results from coronavirus antibody tests have started to trickle in, and they bolster the consensus among disease experts that the virus is significantly more lethal than seasonal flu and has seeded the most disruptive pandemic in the last century. “I think it is the worst pandemic since 1918,” said Cecile Viboud, an epidemiologist at the National Institutes of Health’s Fogarty International Center, alluding to the “Great Influenza” pandemic that claimed an estimated 675,000 lives in the United States. The new serological data, which is provisional, suggests that coronavirus infections greatly outnumber confirmed covid-19 cases, potentially by a factor of 10 or more. Many people experience mild symptoms or none at all, and never get the standard diagnostic test with a swab up the nose, so they’re missed in the official covid-19 case counts. Higher infection rates mean lower lethality risk on average. But the corollary is that this is a very contagious disease capable of being spread by people who are asymptomatic — a challenge for communities hoping to end their shutdowns. The crude case fatality rates, covering people who have a covid-19 diagnosis, have been about 6 percent globally as well as in the United States. But when all the serological data is compiled and analyzed, the fatality rate among people who have been infected could be less than 1 percent. But as infectious disease experts point out, even a seemingly low rate can translate into a shockingly large death toll if the virus spreads through a major portion of the population. [Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.] New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) said Monday that the latest antibody numbers in New York City indicate that 25 percent of the population of 8.8 million has already been infected. The city has recorded more than 12,000 confirmed covid-19 deaths, and lists another 5,000 as probable deaths. That is an infection fatality rate between 0.5 and 0.8 percent, depending on which death toll is factored in. (A spike in all-cause deaths in recent weeks also suggests that some coronavirus-related deaths have not been captured by mortality statistics.) “The death rate is much, much lower,” Cuomo said Monday, referring to the serology tests. He said the New York state rate appears to be 0.5 percent — which is one death per 200 infections. That figure is still sobering to infectious disease experts. A rate of 0.5 percent “is way more than a usual flu season and I would think way more than the ’57 or 1968 [influenza] pandemic death toll, too,” Viboud said. This is a novel, highly infectious virus, and so everyone who hasn’t had an infection is presumably susceptible. It is unclear whether and for how long a person who recovers from covid-19 will have immunity. Research shows that, in a completely vulnerable population that takes no precautions, each infected person will infect well more than two others on average, and some estimates put that reproduction number over three.  Epidemiologists have said somewhere between 40 to 70 percent of the population will likely become infected in the next couple of years if there is no vaccine and the public does not take aggressive measures to limit the spread of the virus. “Do the math!” said Jeffrey Shaman, a Columbia University epidemiologist who has been studying the coronavirus since early in the outbreak. Shaman and his colleagues have developed a model of the coronavirus spread that estimates that only 1 in 12 infections in the United States have been documented in official counts. That leads to an infection fatality rate of 0.6 percent, he said — a figure that roughly matches what has been seen in New York City. At that rate, the United States could potentially experience 1 million deaths if half the population became infected and no efforts were made to limit the contagion through social distancing, a vaccine or proven therapeutics, Shaman said. “That’s 20 times worse than a bad flu season,” he said Monday. This is obviously a highly politicized pandemic, and some critics of the nationwide shutdown have seized on this early antibody data to argue that covid-19 isn’t all that deadly. A common refrain is that the disease is not significantly worse than the flu. In this view, the pandemic threat has been wildly exaggerated. “Pandemic Is Over. Let’s Stop the Economic Suicide, and Get Back to Work,” declared a headline on a column by free market advocate George Gilder on the RealClearMarkets website. He said policies to control the viral spread “should be reversed summarily and acknowledged to be a mistake, perpetrated by statisticians with erroneous computer models.” Kevin McCullough, a columnist for the conservative website Town Hall, wrote a column that ran last week with the headline “Antibody Testing: Proves We’ve Been Had!” “Nearly everything we’ve been told about models, rates of infection, deaths, and recoveries was inaccurate,” he wrote. “The death rate in New York State isn’t 7.4%, it is actually .75%.” But the two numbers describe different things: The first is a case fatality rate, reflecting deaths among people with confirmed diagnoses of covid-19. The second is the infection fatality rate, extrapolated from the antibody surveys. In other words, both numbers can be correct, and useful. “Those higher numbers of case fatality rates, they’re still true,” Viboud said. “It’s your probability of dying if you’re clinically sick with it, which is something that people may care about, too.” Moreover, the fatality rate of a virus, however it is defined, is not an innate feature of the pathogen. It depends on many variables, including the age and health of the population and access to health care. Timing matters, too: In China the fatality rate was high during the initial phase of the outbreak, when hospitals were overwhelmed and doctors struggled to cope with the crisis. AD There are so many numbers flying around that it is understandable that people may struggle to make sense of them. That’s become even more difficult in recent days due to serological studies that haven’t been peer-reviewed but have been presented to the public, typically with dramatic public health conclusions attached. The most controversial such study came out of Santa Clara County, Calif., the heart of Silicon Valley. It claimed that the true number of infections in the county in early April may have been 50 to 85 times the official coronavirus case counts. Extrapolating from that, it gave an estimated infection fatality rate of between 0.12 and 0.2 percent. That provided what seemed like reliable ammunition to those who believe the danger of covid-19 has been overstated. They said the numbers show this disease is not much different from seasonal flu. AD A commonly cited statistic about seasonal flu is that it has a fatality rate of 0.1 percent, That, however, is a case fatality rate. The infection fatality rate for flu is perhaps only half that, Viboud said. Shaman estimated that it’s about one-quarter the case fatality rate. Thus, even if the Santa Clara numbers are roughly accurate about the spread of the virus and its lethality, it would still be deadlier than the flu. Statisticians and other epidemiologists have argued that there were also errors in data analysis in the Santa Clara report, which was led by researchers at Stanford University. The researchers used advertisements on Facebook to call for volunteers, and critics said that may have led to an unrepresentative sampling of the county. The critics noted that even a small rate of false positives can skew a survey in which the targeted disease has low prevalence. AD Shaman, the epidemiologist, said he hopes the higher estimates for infections and commensurately lower fatality rates are correct. Everyone needs more testing and better data, he said. For now, the preponderance of evidence describes an exceptional pathogen. For someone like Shaman, who wears a mask when he walks the dog in New York City and is conscientious about washing his hands, there is no doubt that the endgame is far away — that until a vaccine or reliable therapeutics are in place, or when so many people have been sickened and then recovered that the country achieves “herd immunity,” everyone needs to try to limit the spread of the virus. “We have completely disrupted our society through our social distancing practices, shutting our businesses, closing our schools, and still this thing has already killed 53,000 people in the United States,” he said. “We have a very long way to go until we get herd immunity.”",true/false

172,"Dr. Didier Raoult published new results of 1,061 coronavirus patients treated using hdroxychloroquine with 91% success rate. Dr. Raoult found: “Hydroxychloroquine Azithromycin combination, when started immediately after diagnosis, is a safe and efficient treatment for COVID-19, with a mortality rate of 0.5%, in elderly patients. It avoids worsening and clears virus persistence and contagiosity in most cases.” We first wrote about renowned Dr. Didier Raoult after he and his team of French researchers conducted a study which showed that 100% of coronavirus patients that received a combination of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment. In a follow-up study, which has a larger sample size of 80 COVID-19 patients, the team found a clinical improvement in all but one 86 year-old patient who died, and one 74-year old patient still in intensive care unit. The team also found that, by administering hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin, they were able to observe an improvement in all cases, except in one patient who arrived with an advanced form, who was over the age of 86, and in whom the evolution was irreversible, according to a new paper published today in IHU Méditerranée Infection. We now have new updates. Tonight, Dr. Oz said during an interview that Dr. Raoult is about to publish the results of his new study. Dr. OZ announced that Dr. Didier Raoult has now treated 1000 coronavirus patient with 99.3% success rate. Of the 1000 patients treatments, 20 patients went to the ICU and 7 patients died. Dr. Raoult said the side effects were trivial things like rash etc. Below is the interview with Dr. Oz talking about his discussion with Dr. Raoul.  The video starts at 21:42 minutes.  This is an updated video. Thanks to one of our readers who brought this to our attention.",other

184,"Adam Castillejo is still free of the virus more than 30 months after stopping anti-retroviral therapy. He was not cured by the HIV drugs, however, but by a stem-cell treatment he received for a cancer he also had, the Lancet HIV journal reports. The donors of those stem cells have an uncommon gene that gives them, and now Mr Castillejo, protection against HIV. In 2011, Timothy Brown, the ""Berlin Patient"" became the first person reported as cured of HIV, three and half years after having similar treatment. Stem-cell transplants appear to stop the virus being able to replicate inside the body by replacing the patient's own immune cells with donor ones that resist HIV infection. Adam Castillejo - the now 40-year-old ""London Patient"" who has decided to go public with his identity - has no detectable active HIV infection in his blood, semen or tissues, his doctors say. It is now a year after they first announced he was clear of the virus and he still remains free of HIV. Lead researcher Prof Ravindra Kumar Gupta, from the University of Cambridge, told BBC News: ""This represents HIV cure with almost certainty. ""We have now had two and a half years with anti-retroviral-free remission. ""Our findings show that the success of stem-cell transplantation as a cure for HIV, first reported nine years ago in the Berlin Patient, can be replicated."" But it will not be a treatment for the millions of people around the world living with HIV. The aggressive therapy was primarily used to treat the patients' cancers, not their HIV. And current HIV drugs remain very effective, meaning people with the virus can live long and healthy lives. Prof Gupta said: ""It is important to note that this curative treatment is high-risk and only used as a last resort for patients with HIV who also have life-threatening haematological malignancies. ""Therefore, this is not a treatment that would be offered widely to patients with HIV who are on successful anti-retroviral treatment."" But it might offer hope of finding a cure, in the future, using gene therapy. How does it work? CCR5 is the most commonly used receptor by HIV-1 - the virus strain of HIV that dominates around the world - to enter cells. But a very small number of people who are resistant to HIV have two mutated copies of the CCR5 receptor. This means the virus cannot penetrate cells in the body it normally infects. Researchers say it may be possible to use gene therapy to target the CCR5 receptor in people with HIV. It is the same receptor the now jailed Chinese scientist He Jiankui worked on when he created the world's first gene-edited babies. Is it a permanent cure? The tests suggest 99% of Mr Castillejo's immune cells have been replaced by donor ones. But he still has remnants of the virus in his body, as does Mr Brown. And it is impossible to say with absolute certainty his HIV will never come back. Mr Castillejo told the New York Times: ""This is a unique position to be in, a unique and very humbling position. ""I want to be an ambassador of hope. ""I don't want people to think, 'Oh, you've been chosen.' ""No, it just happened. ""I was in the right place, probably at the right time, when it happened."" Prof Sharon Lewin, from the University of Melbourne, Australia, said: ""Given the large number of cells sampled here and the absence of any intact virus, is the London Patient truly cured? ""The additional data provided in this follow-up case report is certainly encouraging but unfortunately, in the end, only time will tell.""",other

208,"A report in the British Medical Journal illustrates how a woman has beaten blood cancer with the help of turmeric. In 2007, 67-year-old Dieneke Ferguson was diagnosed with myeloma and she progressed to stage three within 15 months. Three failed rounds of chemotherapy and four failed stem cell transplants later, doctors told her she had very little hope. She told the U.K.’s Daily Mail: “I have been on all sorts of toxic drugs and the side-effects were terrifying.” She once lost her memory for three days, and two vertebrae in her spine collapsed and had to be injected with a type of concrete for stability. Four years after her initial diagnosis, she took matters into her own hands and started taking a daily dose of curcumin, the key component of turmeric. She took eight grams every evening on an empty stomach. Since then, her cancer has stabilized and her blood counts have returned to normal. She has also enjoyed a good quality of life. When she told her oncologist she was taking turmeric, she reports that he was very interested after seeing what a big difference it made. Myeloma is the second most common type of blood cancer, and it begins in plasma cells in the bone marrow. When these cells become abnormal and begin to multiply, it becomes myeloma and causes severe pain, nerve damage, fatigue and bone damage. Treatment is generally geared toward controlling its symptoms because there is no cure, and people typically don’t live beyond five years of being diagnosed. The BMJ report says that Ferguson’s results suggest that turmeric could be used to help myeloma patients in the future, adding: “The fact that our patient, who had advanced stage disease and was effectively salvaged while exclusively on curcumin, suggests a potential antimyeloma effect of curcumin.” No other possible explanation for her recovery The report’s co-author, Jamie Cavenagh, said that there is no other possible explanation for her remarkable recovery beyond the curcumin. She continues to take the tablets to this day. The scientists are recommending further evaluation in clinical trials to pursue the possibility of using it as an official treatment. This could prove difficult, however, because doctors cannot prescribe it until it has been tested in wide-scale trials that cost millions. Natural compounds cannot be patented, so finding an investor would be extremely difficult. Turmeric benefits a wide range of ailments Turmeric is a perennial herb that contains the natural antioxidant polyphenol curcumin, which also has analgesic properties. It has been shown to inhibit the growth of myelomaand several other types of tumor cells. Some of the other illnesses that can benefit from curcumin include infections, dementia, depression and heart disease. A 2016 review in the Journal of Medicinal Food highlighted its potential for arthritis treatment, and doctors have also applauded its anti-inflammatory effects. A recent study found that it can help destroy neuroblastoma tumor cells, showing promise as a way to treat the most common type of cancer in infants. Another study is expected to be published soon showing its positive effects on bowel cancer. Although Ferguson said she took turmeric on an empty stomach, it is usually recommended that people take it with a fat or oil to help boost its absorption because it is a fat-soluble compound. Many people enjoy turmeric with yogurt or warm milk. In addition, studies have shown that taking it with black pepper boosts absorption significantly; many supplements also contain a small amount of black pepper for this reason. It’s wonderful to hear that people are successfully treating problems that doctors cannot conquer using nothing more than what nature has provided us. Not everyone will have the same success that Ferguson did, but the fact that natural solutions can help people turn around “hopeless” situations deserves further exploration, profit possibilities or not.",other
