But the proposals are so far ranging that lads could be dragged before courts and face serious sentences if they whistle at a woman and she calls police.  Workers who “objectify and harass” women in the streets face being cuffed and prosecuted, campaigners have warned.  New rules would make “behaviour towards a woman by men simply because they are a woman” equal to crimes where victims are attacked for their race, religion or sexual orientation.  Image: GETTY  A wolf-whistle would be unlikely to constitute a public order offence, but would be looked at more seriously if it formed a pattern of behaviour.  Incidents that could be looked at by police include harassment in the street, verbal abuse, unwanted physical approaches, taking photographs without consent or sending unwanted text messages.  Trialled by Notts Police, campaigners are now calling for the rules to go nationwide. An open letter signed by several groups and faith leaders has demanded the National Police Chiefs Council make misogyny – or woman-hating – a crime.

7c9af097,"In Brief The Facts: It is alleged by many in the spiritual community that something called 'THE EVENT' will play out that will either bring about a great awakening and the end of an era of struggle and captivity for humanity.  Reflect On: Why do we always hear of events that involve humanity sitting around and waiting for something? Why is it that we never have to take responsibility for our part in something? We are here, not to wait for a saviour, but to take action within the self.  You probably have been hearing about ‘The Event’, in articles, vlogs and conversation. All around the internet are preparing people for what some are calling the ascension event that will suddenly wake everyone up and end all of the cabal behavior on the planet.  There’s a lot to say about this, and a lot of helpful info we can consider to bring ourselves to a point of understanding as well as practicality, i.e. what we can do. My intention here isn’t to burst any bubbles about this, but to bring us back to an authentic place within ourselves and also back to our intuition.  One final thing, over the course of the past 10 years I’ve not shared much about where I get my info, what I’ve been tapped into since I was younger, the practices I use and how I’ve practiced to truly develop some of these skills. I’ve kept more quiet because I personally like to fly under the radar; simply be myself, remain quiet and live the change and my truth. I don’t believe in having to be loud about our abilities to convince others of who we are. Tapping into intuition, having a strong connection 24 hours a day to my higher self, hearing beings, ‘downloading’ or visually seeing and connecting with peoples lives, getting consistent info downloads etc, these are all a natural part of my life but it’s not something that makes me or anyone else special. It’s simply part of developing it. Some of us may start with different ‘abilities’ more activated, but we can always develop things. CE wasn’t built the way it was simply by using my mind to figure things out, it took diligent conscious practice and intuition to know what was most serving for humanity and when. To take complex conscious ideas and make them reach a mass audience and create virality.  I share this because, we seem to be at a time where confusion is high, disinformation is even higher, and many of us aren’t truly practicing the information we are hearing about or learning. So I share this as what I’m about to convey below is important and I don’t wish to reduce the content to simply ‘I’ve done research,’ these truths come from deeper places. The same places you can access through heart based living and a solid connection to your higher self.  I believe we need to ‘cut the crap’ when it comes to all the identification with “I’m an intuitive,” “I’m an empath,” “I’m a channeller” etc, and realize we all have those abilities within us if we choose to awaken by practice. It’s time for true empowerment ??  What Has Been Said About ‘The Event’  First let’s begin with what’s being said. It is being called a breakthrough for the planet that will cause a number of different unfoldments. Some say the defeat and arrest of the cabal, resetting of financial systems, disclosure of ET’s, aliens coming to the planet, revelation of new and advanced technologies, new governments and political systems etc.  It’s being claimed that on the non physical plane: there will be a “big wave or flash of energy and light coming from the Galactic Central sun going towards the surface of the planet”. The galactic central sun is an object in the Sagittarius constellation. The energy from the Central Sun will stimulate a flash or special kind of light from the Sun that permeates the earth and humanity, raising the frequencies of all living entities on the planet.  It is said that it will not be a major negative event but one that is positive. Some are even suggesting to prepare with several weeks of food and supplies as it may knock out our current infrastructures. It’s also being said that this wave of energy will be soooo powerful that it will literally fry people’s brains and make them go crazy.  I have a lot to say about all of this.  First, A Note On Channeling  From what I have gathered, most people are learning ‘channeling’ information about this from various sources or beings out there. This of course is a real thing and completely possible, but there are caveats that we often don’t consider. I’ve experienced some very good, very talented channellers who are tapped right in to authentic stuff, then again I’ve also seen the opposite.  In a lot of ways I have always steered people away from channeling. Mainly because it takes a level of mastery to truly understand and feel out what one is tapping into. Not only that, much of the time the information you can get from your higher self is more than enough to keep you rolling, and it has nothing to do with channeling. Your connection to your higher self is constant if you practice. The desire to jump deep into channeling can sometimes come from an egoic desire to want to see the future, know the future or even in some ways.. have a ‘super power’ of sorts. I’m not saying there is anything wrong with this, but more so that this can be what pushes us to want it. Like I said above, of course there are many authentic channellers out there as well.  Over the 10 years I have been exploring and observing different channellers, I’ve noticed a lot of the same thing. Repeating the same stuff over and over again, repeating vague and often obvious things, noticing that the channelled info is simply coming from the mind of the channeller and not actually from another being or source etc. From a personal point of view, my message has always been about going within, instead of focusing so much attention on getting information like this from outside ourselves.  From a listener point of view, there is general curiosity which is a beautiful thing, but sometimes we also start jumping into the idea of wanting to know what’s going to happen, being aware of the future and what’s coming… so as to control things or be able to prepare. This can be helpful at times, but it can also be a source of getting us stuck or limited. It also resembles a faith based, religious-like mentality where we take word of what is to come, and then act on that, without ever checking how we feel inside. The way I’ve practiced over the years is, my primary source 85% – 90% of where I get my information like this is from my own self or higher self, my secondary source would be corroborating information with various sources out there like other people, channellers, intuitives etc etc. I feel this is a more ideal course of action as it asks YOU to develop your own knowing and connection with & to your higher self. This is part of an authentic path towards shifting consciousness when we take action and make the necessary changes from within.  The Reality Of What’s Happening  I made a film several years ago called The Collective Evolution III: The Shift. It is all about the shift in consciousness taking place, what’s going on and where humanity is headed. It’s presented in a way that can be passed across any group; those that view things through science, spirituality or who are on the fence. The purpose of the film was to bring these understandings to a grounded and practical space, where much of the human experience exists at this time. In the film, I go into great detail about the cosmic ray portion of the shift, which much of The Event refers to. I’d recommend watching the film for further understanding, but will also elaborate below.  The shift we’re experiencing is ongoing. MANY waves have already hit our planet and are still coming. This has been happening for years and it is PART of what is causing so many of the changes we are seeing today. Shifts in the way people think, shifts in how our world works, insurgence of equality, the calls for changes in our financial systems, political systems and so forth.  These waves have been happening for decades and have been intensifying as we go. They are made up of cosmic bursts from our sun, the galactic sun, surrounding stars and so forth. All cosmic waves carry unique energies with unique signatures and information. This information carries the ability to evolve thought, ideas, DNA, change energy signatures and so forth. But it’s also important to note that this energy has be ‘throttled’ in a sense, through our agreement, and for good reason. More on this in a second.  THE EVENT is following the same path as many other claims like this. It makes this shift in consciousness about ONE thing, ONE moment and so forth. Much like we did with 2012.  Many claim “nothing happened in 2012” because they were looking for something physical and were looking for something HUGE to happen. Yet energies did in fact shift in big ways in and around the 2012 dates many were talking about. But they also shifted in ways prior to that, and after that as well. This shift is a process and one that will continue to unfold over time little by little. Yes many of us are wearing a bit thin as this intensifies, but this simply means we have work to do and it might be harsh to accept but if I’ve witnessed a prominent practice in the overall spiritual movement it’s not practicing what we preach. “I know that information already!” But are you doing it?  Continuing on here, yes, bigger events will continue to take place and mass ‘traumas’ will be experienced as we are challenged with big time change, but we won’t bite off more than we can chew. I say traumas to describe what will feel like very tough times for many people as we realize, en masse, things like the existence of a cabal, how we’ve been systematically manipulated our entire lives, our spiritual connection hindered on purpose etc. This will be tough until we work through it all. Hence traumatic feelings.  Humanity often feels like we are victim to things we experience. Energies, beings, events happening, other people etc, but we choose and agree to things and take them on as we are ready for them. This doesn’t mean that being ready for it won’t cause some pain, the idea isn’t avoiding pain. With pain we often get growth. Suffering comes when we choose to ignore the growth that can be presented to us through pain.  I know that idea doesn’t sit well with some of us but ask the question, where does sitting with pain and holding onto it forever lead us? Even from a logical perspective, the answer is to work past it and grow from it, as lingering only creates more suffering.  It has been 10 years since I founded Collective Evolution and began working in the consciousness space. During that time I have created a conscious media and education company CE, 4 films in the consciousness space and have met many spiritual teachers from around the world for interviews, as friends and so forth. I also have diligently practiced exploring consciousness through sober means, developing my intuition and so forth. In my courses I spread the message of authentic change from within that is built around truly shifting your consciousness so your connection to self and your way of being is automatic, not built on acting from belief systems.  From this space I share simply that the overwhelming feeling points to the fact that humanity is on a journey, one that may be slow at times, but challenges US to be the ones that take action. We must take action from within to shift ourselves; it’s through that space within ourselves that we begin to take action to shift our external world.  Much like we see when we do EVERYTHING for someone and never challenge them to do their own work and suddenly they don’t quite learn and aren’t empowered in their own way, we are on that journey with the shift we face personally as well. Although it’s tempting to view a single event as something that will come in and do the bulk of the work for us, this isn’t going to happen simply because it doesn’t serve us. This is a gradual process.  We’re here to do the work within ourselves. Yes, energies will come in and assist with that process as the sun and central sun act as a purveyors of evolution, but it’s also up to us. Beings are already watching and assisting closely in slowing down many of the energies coming in due to the fact that they are a bit too intense for our consciousness at the moment. This is primarily because many of us aren’t actually practicing what we are learning. We read books, learn about things and then go on living in the same old ways. We don’t shift our diets, we don’t practice meditation or presence, we don’t disempower the ego and we don’t live from our hearts, even though we know this will lead us to a thriving world.  Partly this happens because our current world is intense. There is a lot of work being done to keep us stuck, keep us distracted and so forth. But this is simply presented as an added challenge, to help build our strength within ourselves. We CAN DO IT, otherwise we wouldn’t have bit off this much. Remember that.  Don’t Wait, It’s Now  More than waiting or focusing on a single event, look at what we have right here, right now – in our world and within ourselves. This is truly all we have to focus on, and as you have intuitive feelings towards other things, follow them. But remember to not get fixated on events, dates and promises that claim to come in and take care of everything for us. NOW is most important. Our financial systems, political systems, technologies and so forth will shift and evolve as we do.. it’s not one before the other. Remember quantum physics? We determine our external reality based on how our consciousness projects our world. How do we project a thriving world if we don’t do the internal work first to shift our consciousness? Our outside world simply reflects us. For it to shift, we must do so first.  Are you doing what you love in your life and living from a space where you follow your hearts desires? Are you practicing the observation of the ego and continually shifting from egoic consciousness to heart based living? Are you practicing meditation to reduce over-thinking and more presence? Are you treating others in a way you would want to be treated.. as much as you can, not just sometimes? Are you choosing to empathize and understand where people are at and why vs judging them and calling them names?  All of these things are ways to move towards living in the heart. It’s about going from the mind, to the heart.  Some Key Reflections  When it comes to beings/aliens, remember that in many ways they are just souls having an experience and they may or may not have had experiences as humans. Their advice sometimes may be missing some key details on what it means to be human.  Beings are not ‘above us’. Aliens are not ‘above us.’ We don’t need to bring the mentality in that humans are some primitive culture, as this brings about judgement most of the time. We are all just having experiences, and in many ways we teach things to these other beings just as they teach us.  What can you do right now to practice living in your heart and make that a daily state of being?  Getting or hearing information from outside of yourself is great, and it’s part of how we use one another to learn. Are you checking within yourself about whether or not things are true? How does it feel for you when you know it’s true?",Scientist Explains Why He Believes Aluminum Is “Almost Certainly” Playing A Role in Autism,false,
,"As many as 45,000 people may have died from the mRNA shots being given to halt COVID, according to prominent physician Dr. Peter McCullough.  And teenagers — especially boys — are more at risk from being hospitalized from the vaccine than they are for COVID, he said. The culprit is myocarditis, inflammation of the heart.  McCullough should know. He wrote the book on cardiology. Literally.  Published more than 650 times in medical journals, editor of a cardiology journal, author of a cardiology textbook, as well as being an internist and qualified in public health, McCullough is critical of government response to the COVID pandemic.  McCullough’s background has included serving on review teams for new vaccines, so he was surprised at what happened in early 2021 when the COVID vaccines were rolled out.  “I chaired data safety monitoring boards … a couple dozen times — I know what I’m talking about,” McCullough said.  “I’ve shut down, with my committees, big pharma programs … I mean, huge pharma programs.”  But things were handled very differently for the COVID vaccines, and McCullough called FDA actions “reprehensible and reckless.”  Under normal circumstances, when officials learned on January 22 of this year that there had already been 182 deaths following 278 million shots, the vaccine program would have been halted, McCulloch said recently on the DarkHorse podcast of scientist Bret Weinstein.  “Our [COVID] vaccine program would have been shut down in February for excess mortality in America,” he said.  McCullough said the shutdown should have been similar to the 1976 suspension of nationwide voluntary vaccination for the swine flu following only three deaths and 94 cases of paralysis due to those shots.  He said there are major risks with the COVID shots, especially for old people.  “We now know it’s the seniors who die with the vaccine … 50 percent of these deaths occur within 48 hours, 80 percent within a week,” he said.  “There’s nursing home studies from Europe and Scandinavia. They show — when they actually review the charts there in the seniors — at least 40 percent, the doctors have concluded, are directly due to the vaccines.”  McCullough said patients suffered “severe reactions, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, blood pressure dropping and then death within a day or two, whether it’s basically a cardiopulmonary collapse due to overwhelming production of the spike protein or a thromboembolic or bleeding death a few weeks later.  “But they are clearly biologically related to the vaccines,” he said.  There’s also risk to young people, according to McCullough, noting that some obituaries for young adults are listing vaccination as the cause of death.  Then there are the side effects. Even the Food and Drug Administration agrees there is a link between myocarditis and the shots. “It was in younger children — it was serious! Ninety percent required hospitalization,” McCullough said.  Are the vaccines a greater risk for teens than COVID? Yes No  Completing this poll entitles you to The Western Journal news updates free of charge. You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Yes: 89% (25 Votes) No: 11% (3 Votes)  The FDA and CDC recognized 200 myocarditis cases in June, but the total has since jumped to 11,000 certified cases in the VAERS [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System] system, the U.S. database which tracks vaccine-related deaths and injuries.  The myocarditis cases affect boys more than girls and “the real rate of myocarditis is at least 50 percent greater than what the [Centers for Disease Control] ever projected,” McCullough said, adding that children age 12 to 17 are more likely to be hospitalized for myocarditis than for COVID.  When Weinstein noted the vaccine mandates, the bullying, the stigmatizing of the unvaccinated, the demise of civil liberties and general ignorance of myocarditis, McCullough responded that, in general, people are willing to do what it takes to stop COVID.  “But people aren’t willing to sacrifice their life for this.  “And that’s what they’re being asked for; they’re being asked to … take a vaccine, and even though it’s rare, you could lose your life and then people are saying, ‘Well, how rare is rare?’ and I can just tell you, the mortality rate by all expert analyses is unacceptably high.  “We’re at 18,000 people in the CDC U.S. VAERS; about half of those are domestic — Americans — that have died with the vaccine.  “There is very good work done with the CMS [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] data suggesting the underreporting factor on this is about five, so if you take 9,000 times 5, we currently are at some number that is, you know, 45,000 – 50,000 [American deaths]. And that’s conservative. It could be greater than that.”  People are becoming aware of what’s going on, according to McCullough. “People are walking away from their jobs because they know they could die with the vaccine.  “Once the word got out that people could die after the vaccine — in fact, deaths were occurring in large numbers — that was by mid-April … Rates of vaccination plummeted in mid-April. They absolutely plummeted.  “The word got out. It doesn’t matter what was on Twitter or on major media, people were talking to one another — everyone knew.  Yet, despite ongoing media and political alarmism, the COVID crisis is over, McCulloch said.  That’s because 80 percent of children in the U.S. already have had COVID. And they and everyone else who has had COVID are protected by natural immunity.  “And now the CDC in the last week has acknowledged that they don’t have a single case of someone who has recovered from COVID getting it a second time and passing to anyone.  “So it’s basically over with.”  McCullough cited a preprint study posted in September at clinicalnews.org, that, while not yet peer-reviewed, supported his observations regarding vaccinated teens. It noted “a 4-fold increased risk of postvaccination myocarditis in those who had previously been infected” with COVID.  The report said it had been assumed that risks of COVID would outweigh risks of vaccination in 16- to 17-year-old boys, but the study found just the opposite. The report “predicted excess cases of vaccine-associated myocarditis/pericarditis would exceed COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths under the ‘worst case scenario.'”  Also, risks of myocarditis weighed heavily on males, with boys aged 12-15 having myocarditis rates of 162.2 per million compared to 13 cases per million for girls aged 12-15. Boys aged 16-17 had 94 cases per million compared to 13.4 cases per million for girls of that age, the clinicalnews.org study said.

,"A recent study reported by the NCBI, which is under the National Institutes of Health, showed that masks do absolutely nothing to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and their use is even harmful.  NIH published a medical hypothesis by Dr. Baruch Vainshelboim.  NOQ Report uncovered the study:  …a DuckDuckGo search reveals it [the study] was picked up by ZERO mainstream media outlets and Big Tech tyrants will suspend people who post it, as political strategist Steve Cortes learned the hard way when he posted a Tweet that went against the face mask narrative.

TRENDING: ""I Went There for You My Son"" - J6 Political Prisoner Chris Quaglin Was Brutally Beaten in Jail and Denied Celiac-Safe Food - Here Is His Heartfelt Letter to His Son on His First Birthday -- Please Donate  The NCBI study begins with the following abstract:  Many countries across the globe utilized medical and non-medical facemasks as non-pharmaceutical intervention for reducing the transmission and infectivity of [the] coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Although, scientific evidence supporting facemasks’ efficacy is lacking, adverse physiological, psychological and health effects are established. It has been hypothesized that facemasks have compromised safety and efficacy profile and should be avoided from use. The current article comprehensively summarizes scientific evidence[s] with respect to wearing facemasks in the COVID-19 era, providing proper information for public health and decision making.  The study concludes (emphasis added):  The existing scientific evidence[s] challenge the safety and efficacy of wearing facemask as preventive intervention for COVID-19. The data suggest that both medical and non-medical facemasks are ineffective to block human-to-human transmission of viral and infectious disease such SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, supporting against the usage of facemasks. Wearing facemasks has been demonstrated to have substantial adverse physiological and psychological effects. These include hypoxia, hypercapnia, shortness of breath, increased acidity and toxicity, activation of fear and stress response, rise in stress hormones, immunosuppression, fatigue, headaches, decline in cognitive performance, predisposition for viral and infectious illnesses, chronic stress, anxiety and depression. Long-term consequences of wearing facemask can cause health deterioration, developing and progression of chronic diseases and premature death. Governments, policy makers and health organizations should utilize [a] proper and scientific evidence-based approach with respect to wearing facemasks, when the latter is considered as preventive intervention for public health.

3c20c6d1,"Can any government statistics on COVID-19 deaths be trusted?  It is an open question now that we are learning that the highly respected, world-class Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC has been lying to us.  This revelation comes a few days after I wrote here at American Thinker that New York City was lying about COVID-19 deaths. The normal rules about reporting deaths have been violated by that city in the rush to inflate the body count, presumably to steer more taxpayer money to the Big Apple.  That the CDC isn’t telling the truth to Americans is no conspiracy theory: it’s right out there in the open for everyone to see. The CDC openly admits that it is fudging the COVID-19 death figures.  We know this because, among other truth-tellers, a plainspoken small-town physician from Kalispell, Montana, has pulled back the curtain.  Dr. Annie Bukacek, MD, explained in a presentation how death certificates are made. See “Montana physician Dr. Annie Bukacek discusses how COVID-19 death certificates are being manipulated,” YouTube, April 6  Why should anyone care how a certificate of death is made?  Everyone should care “today when governments are making massive changes that affect our constitutional rights and those changes are based on inaccurate statistics,” Bukacek says.  The system is deeply flawed, she argues.  Few people know how much individual power and leeway is given to the physician, coroner, or medical examiner, signing the death certificate. How do I know this? I've been filling out death certificates for over 30 years. More often than we want to admit, we don’t know with certainty the cause of death when we fill out death certificates. That is just life. We are doctors, not God. Autopsies are rarely performed and even when an autopsy is done the actual cause of death is not always clear. Physicians make their best guesstimate and fill out the form. Then that listed cause of death … is entered into a vital records data bank to use for statistical analysis, which then gives out inaccurate numbers, as you can imagine. Those inaccurate numbers then become accepted as factual information even though much of it is false.  This has been the way it has been done for some time, Bukacek says.  So even before we heard of COVID-19, death certificates were based on assumptions and educated guesses that go unquestioned. When it comes to COVID-19 there is the additional data skewer, that is –get this— there is no universal definition of COVID-19 death. The Centers for Disease Control, updated from yesterday, April 4th, still states that mortality, quote unquote, data includes both confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COVID-19. That’s from their website. Translation? The CDC counts both true COVID-19 cases and speculative guesses of COVID-19 the same. They call it death by COVID-19. They automatically overestimate the real death numbers, by their own admission. Prior to COVID-19, people were more likely to get an accurate cause of death written on their death certificate if they died in the hospital. Why more accurate when a patient dies in the hospital? Because hospital staff has physical examination findings labs, radiologic studies, et cetera, to make a good educated guess. It is estimated that 60 percent of people die in the hospital. But even [with] those in-hospital deaths, the cause of death is not always clear, especially in someone with multiple health conditions, each of which could cause the death.  Bukacek refers to a March 24 CDC memo from Steven Schwartz, director of the Division of Vital Statistics for the National Center for Health Statistics, titled “COVID-19 Alert No. 2.”  “The assumption of COVID-19 death,” she says, “can be made even without testing. Based on assumption alone the death can be reported to the public as another COVID-19 casualty.”  There is a question-and-answer section on the memo.  One question is, “Will COVID-19 be the underlying cause?”  The answer is: “The underlying cause depends upon what and where conditions are reported on the death certificate. However, the rules for coding and selection of the underlying cause of death are expected to result in COVID-19 being the underlying cause more often than not.”  Another question is, “Should ‘COVID-19’ be reported on the death certificate only with a confirmed test?”  The answer is:  “COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or is assumed to have caused or contributed to death.” [Boldfacing in original]  “You could see how these statistics have been made to look really scary when it is so easy to add false numbers to the official database,” Bukacek says. “Those false numbers are sanctioned by the CDC.”  “The real number of COVID-19 deaths are not what most people are told and what they then think,” she says.  “How many people have actually died from COVID-19 is anyone’s guess … but based on how death certificates are being filled out, you can be certain the number is substantially lower than what we are being told. Based on inaccurate, incomplete data people are being terrorized by fearmongers into relinquishing cherished freedoms.”  It’s hard to argue with what Dr. Bukacek says, but no doubt angry social media mobs will find a way as her chilling words enlighten the populace that has been bullied into submission.  Of course, the disease’s body count is not the sole concern we should have about the Chinese contagion, but it is undeniably the primary driver of the rampant mass hysteria that has allowed state and local governments across America to crush our cherished civil liberties.  As they say in newsrooms: if it bleeds, it leads. Deaths are always going to be more “sexy” than confirmed cases. It is the number that really, really counts, and Americans know this.  The fraudulent death statistics also give ammunition to the legions of snitches and scolds who try to shame their fellow Americans for attending church or playing catch in an empty park or taking a harmless drive in the countryside to prevent themselves from going stir-crazy.  The fake death data from the CDC, coupled with wild guesstimates from experts, and the relentless barrage of fear porn the mainstream media subjects Americans to around the clock, have been getting results, even with a plague that is, so far at least, underperforming.  First, experts told us 2.2 million Americans would die. Then the number fell off a cliff, plunging down to around 200,000.  As of April 8, the number of those expected to die from the disease by August 4 was down to 60,000, or roughly a very nasty flu season. The new figure comes from the influential model produced by the University of Washington that the White House regularly cites.  Has social-distancing, wearing face masks, hosing down packages with bleach, using hand sanitizer that is at least 60 percent alcohol, and washing hands with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds helped bring the grim worst-case-scenario body count down?  Probably, I’m guessing, but it’s hard to know for sure.  Maybe those epidemiological modelers can be forgiven for scaring the bejeezus out of Americans. Epidemiology is not, after all, an exact science, as its practitioners sometimes acknowledge.  But those who have force-fed modelers skewed data that led to the terrifying death forecasts that stampeded governors into pushing the nation down the road to totalitarianism need to be held to account.

The bill for complying with its judgments has seen money thrown at litigation and diverted from essential services, it is claimed.    The court, based in Strasbourg, France, has even forced Parliament to overturn a number of UK laws. It even made the government give prisoners the vote – despite strong opposition from ministers and the public.    Law and Order: The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, where membership is costing Britain billions    The court rules on cases brought against countries that have signed the European Convention on Human Rights, a code drawn up in the light of Nazi and Soviet totalitarianism.    The study into how much the convention and its court cost Britain, which became a signatory in 1950, was carried out by the TaxPayers’ Alliance.    Dr Lee Rotherham, author of the report, said: ‘Fifty years on from the days of Stalin and Hitler, the Strasbourg court is no longer needed to protect us from a knock on the door at 3am, or being deported with a handcart. It carries an increasingly political agenda that is running roughshod over our laws and our courts, at major costs to the taxpayer and to business.    ‘In the homeland of Magna Carta, you would hope that politicians and human rights lawyers might have more self confidence. Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States get by very well without joining up to continental human rights courts. Britain can too.’  Controversial rulings include a transsexual serving time for manslaughter and attempted rape being allowed to move to a woman’s prison even though he committed the offences while a man. The court has also prevented the deportation of foreigners found guilty of serious offences.    The UK lost its first case at the court – which is independent from the EU – in 1975 and had to pay out its first damages in 1980. The report suggested that Britain has lost more than three quarters – 331 out of 418 – of cases heard in Strasbourg.    Labour’s Human Rights Act of 1998 was supposed to reduce the number of appeals to Europe by applying Strasbourg principles in British courts. The rate of lost cases has worsened however.    The cost of complying with judgments under the convention is £17.3billion to date, the report said. In addition, the growth of a compensation culture fostered by the court has added a further £25billion in costs.    Sian Herbert, of the think tank Open Europe, said: ‘The ECHR and the European Court of Justice [which rules on EU law] now act as a de facto supreme court in the UK in many ways.    ‘While we need to remain a country committed to strong protection of basic liberties and rights, these two bodies lack the democratic and judicial legitimacy to fulfil this duty.’",Human rights laws cost Britain £42 bn in rulings and payouts,false,
,"The official European Union database of suspected drug reaction website is now reporting 30,551 fatalities and 1,163,356 adverse drug reactions from COVID vaccines Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and AztraZeneca through November 13, 2021 based on the data submitted to its system.  According to European Medicines Agency, an official website of the European Union, the data of adverse reaction from COVID-19 vaccines were posted in ADRreports.eu portal that “allows users to view the total number of individual suspected side effect reports (also known as Individual Case Safety Reports, or ICSRs).”  All the data shown in the website and individual case report forms were taken from EudraVigilance, “a system designed for collecting reports of suspected side effects, used for evaluating the benefits and risks of medicines during their development and monitoring their safety following their authorization in the European Economic Area (EEA).”  The information were submitted electronically to EudraVigilance by “national medicines regulatory authorities and by pharmaceutical companies that hold marketing authorisations (licences) for the medicines.”  TRENDING: Alleged Waukesha Suspect Was Recently Released on Bond - Rapped about 'F**k Donald Trump and F**k Pigs' - Lived in Milwaukee, Launched Attack in Conservative Waukesha  From ADRreports website:  Pharmaceutical companies that hold the marketing authorisation of a medicine, as well as medicines regulatory authorities in the EEA, are legally required to submit reports of suspected side effects to EudraVigilance . This includes reports received from healthcare professionals and patients. This excludes non-serious side effects occurring outside the EEA.

Of 700,000 people who were vaccinated, just 300 later contracted the virus, with only 16 requiring hospital treatment, according to preliminary data released by Israeli health officials.

'It's what we call real life, ecologic evidence of vaccine efficacy - the high efficacy of the vaccine.'  The majority of those vaccinated were over 60, making the results even more remarkable, he added.

According to police reports, they haven’t ruled out foul play, though they can’t imagine who would want Mr. Woods dead. Lead detective Art Tubolls told us that this was one of the saddest cases he’s ever worked:  “To find such a great man slumped over like that was devastating. All I could think about was his portrayal of Roy Cohn, whom he shared so much in common with in real life. “Mr. Woods is a national treasure, dead or alive.”  The coroner hasn’t released an official cause of death:  “We’re not quite sure what happened yet, and we don’t like to speculate. “There is, however, growing evidence that Woods may have died of embarrasment after sharing an article from a liberal troll’s satire network that was both ridiculous and clearly disclaimered. And it wasn’t the first time. It’s sad, but many of that generation seem to have the same issues. Woods is just…a tater. Like the rest of the Trump supporters over 65.”  The FBI has vowed to get involved if they can confirm that Woods was the victim of a hate crime, as long as his buddy Curt Schilling, who was also dumb enough to comment on the fake article, ends up dead, too.

,"By Cassandra Fairbanks and Jim Hoft  On Tuesday, November 3rd President Trump was ahead of Joe Biden in the swing state of Michigan by over 100,000 votes. This appeared to be another solid win for President Trump in Michigan with a greater margin than his 2016 victory. The ballot counting in Detroit, Michigan on election night took place at the TCF Center, formerly known as Cobo Hall.  This is the site where Detroit City Officials put cardboard over the windows to prevent the GOP observers from seeing in, where poll workers were militantly hostile to the GOP observers, and where hundreds of affidavits by election observers claim they witnessed voter fraud.  At least three election observers testified in sworn affidavits that they witnessed vehicles delivering fraudulent ballots to the TCF Center early in the morning on November 4th.  TRENDING: LAWRENCE SELLIN: The Second American Civil War is Underway  Michigander Shane Trejo witnessed the 3:30 am Biden Ballot Drop that gave Joe Biden an outstanding lift. “There were thousands of ballots in each box,” Trejo says. “There were at least 50 boxes that I saw unloaded at 3:30 am, well after the 8:00 pm deadline for ballots to show up.”  The 3:30 am was the first ballot delivery since 10:30 pm when 138,000 ballots showed up suddenly. Shane later testified that he noticed that the city of Detroit Clerk’s Office and its emblem were written on the white van that showed up with the ballots. City Clerk Janice Winfrey‘s name was on the van and a number presumably for Janet Winfrey’s office. Trejo says the ballots could not be processed when they arrived, so by the time they were counted, a new shift of poll workers had come in for the day.  After these ballot drops Joe Biden took the lead in Michigan.  Shane Trejo explained how the timing was important. The Biden Ballot Drop took place at the end of one shift. The ballots were left uncounted. So when the new shift came to count ballots they didn’t know where the ballots had come from.  Trejo repeatedly asked about this truck to site supervisors and was STONEWALLED.  Former Michigan State Senator Pat Colbeck was also present at the TCF Center on the morning of November 4th. Senator Colbeck also witnessed the 3:30 am Biden Ballot Drop. Colbeck spoke with The Gateway Pundit back in November, “I went back there and I witnessed a mini-panel truck if you will with a Detroit Election Bureau regalia all over the side and a vehicle ID number on it… And inside of it, and this gets into some chain of custody discussions, there was no indication that there was a Republican and a Democrat (present) during transfer. We don’t know if they stopped by a sidestreet in Coney Island and picked up a few more ballots during transfer. We have no way of verifying any of that information.”  The authorities and media in Michigan were completely uninterested in following up on this shocking story.  Until today, no one has bothered to review the video footage from the TCF Center on election night.  The Gateway Pundit requested the TCF video back in December!  The TCF Center tried to quote us over $22,000 for one day’s worth of video.  We requested two hours of video.  Last Friday we were sent the requested video.  Since last week we have been combing through the hundreds of hours of security camera footage from the TCF Center on the morning of November 4th.  And what we found is a political bombshell.  ** At 3:23 AM The Gateway Pundit has exclusive video of a white van registered to the city of Detroit entering the gate into the TCF Center.  ** At 3:25 AM we discovered video from a second camera showing three individuals unloading over 50 boxes of ballots in a hallway inside the TCF Building and just outside the counting room.  ** The ballots were then wheeled away on carts into the ballot counting room.  ** The van is then seen on video leaving the center about 25 minutes later.  ** Then we saw the van returning an hour later, entering the TCF Center again and unloading more boxes of ballots.  ** The white van was escorted by a black sports car for both ballot deliveries.  ** The white van was allowed through an electronic gate to enter the TCF complex.  This is video proof of the fraud in Detroit, Michigan. It is exactly as the GOP observers described it to us back in November!  We have more damning video from the TCF Center to release in the coming days.  Here is our video on the election fraud in the Detroit TCF Center on election night:  Special thanks to Cassandra Fairbanks who did an outstanding job on this project.  ** PLEASE SUPPORT THE GATEWAY PUNDIT’S DOCUMENTATION OF MICHIGAN VOTER FRAUD.

e8ac7372,"“Global warming” is a myth — so say 80 graphs from 58 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in 2017. In other words, the so-called “Consensus” on global warming is a massive lie. And Donald Trump was quite right to quit the Paris agreement which pretended that the massive lie was true. By “global warming” these papers don’t, of course, mean the mild warming of around 0.8 degrees Celsius that the planet has experienced since the middle of the 19th century as the world crawled out of the Little Ice Age. Pretty much everyone, alarmists and skeptics alike, is agreed on that. Rather, they mean “global warming” in the sense that is most commonly used today by grant-troughing scientists, and huxter politicians, and scaremongering green activists, and brainwashed mainstream media (MSM) environmental correspondents. “Global warming” as in the scary, historically unprecedented, primarily man-made phenomenon which we must address urgently before the icecaps melt and the Pacific islands disappear beneath the waves and all the baby polar bears drown. What all these papers argue in their different ways is that the alarmist version of global warming — aka Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming (CAGW) — is a fake artefact. That is, all these different experts from around the world — China, Russia, Canada, the U.S., Italy, etc. — have been looking closely at different aspects of the global warming puzzle in various regions and on different timescales and come to the conclusion in irreproachable, peer-reviewed scientific ways that there is no evidence to support the global warming scare story. Late 20th century and early 21st century global warming, they show, is neither dramatic, nor unusual, nor scary. Here, as collated by Kenneth Richard at No Tricks Zone, are just some of the charts to prove it. Büntgen et al, below, shows that temperatures in the northern hemisphere were warmer in the early 1400s than they are today Abrantes et al (below) confirms the traditional view — which Michael Mann tried to dismiss with his discredited Hockey Stick chart — that the Medieval Warming Period was warmer than anything we have experienced in our own era. Here’s one from Li et al showing that China was much warmer 8,000 years ago Here’s an unusual one from Guillet et al suggesting that there’s nothing new about wildly early or late grape harvests through the centuries: And on and on it goes — there are 80 graphs in all, each showing in its different way why the scare about global warming has been horribly overdone because the evidence just doesn’t support its being unusual or a problem. Several of the papers note that the primary influence on warming appears to be solar activity. Few, if any, entertain the notion that carbon dioxide levels have much to do with it. The intellectually corrupt and mendacious alarmist science establishment — I’m thinking, for example, of my personal bete noir, the left-wing political activist and Nobel-prizewinning geneticist Sir Paul Nurse, former president of the Royal Society — would have us believe that climate skepticism is a minority activity, the preserve of a few cranks, championed only by people who don’t do the science. But this is just ugly propaganda. Here are dozens of reputable scientists from around the world with no axe to grind collaborating on studies which all corroborate, independently and rigorously, the increasingly respectable view that “man-made global warming” just isn’t a thing. Not that it ever was a thing, really. This debate — as I argue at some length in Watermelons — was always about left-wing ideology, quasi-religious hysteria, and “follow the money” corruption, never about “science.” Still, it’s always a comfort to know that “the science” is on our side too.

While it has long been rumored that China began massing troops and armor in southern Mexico for a similar invasion goal, word of such troops appearing in Canada only began this year. Those rumors were pretty much laughed off until video emerged this week of Chinese troops on a back road of Salt Spring Island, near Vancouver, British Columbia.  Here is that 35 second video:  Once actual proof emerged of Chinese troops in Canada, we started digging into where they were in relation to US soil and how such a thing could be; given that Canada was _supposed_ to be a U.S. ally?   The map below shows where China is massing the troops in Prince Rupert and on Salt Spring Island, BC, CANADA:  It turns out that the globalist/Commie Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, signed a Treaty with China in late 2019.  In January, 2020, the Canadian Independent Press Review reported it as follows:  Under the terms of the Foreign Investment Protection Act FIPA, a bi-lateral treaty ratified with China by the Trudeau government in 2019, Chinese security forces can be stationed on Canadian soil to protect vital Chinese investments, without the knowledge or consent of local authorities.                    – Canadian Independent Press Review, January 15, 2020  One has to ask why Prime Minister Trudeau would sign such a treaty?  Does Canada not have its own military to protect vital Chinese investments?   Does Canada not trust its own Royal Canadian Mounted Police?  Are Canada's Provincial Police forces somehow inadequate?  Or did Prime Minister Trudeau somehow find that allowing China to mass troops in his country might be beneficial to HIMSELF?  Did Trudeau get a massive payoff from China to betray the United States like this?  What other explanation could there be?  According to locals in British Columbia, PLA troops are troops being stationed in Stanley Park almost an entire island of a park in Vancouver, as temporary housing until they are assigned something permanent.  Look at the size of this park:  Oh, and get this . . .Canadians say THEY CANNOT GO INTO THAT PARK because it is taken over by China's People's Liberation Army!   Anyone trying to enter the park is stopped by Vancouver police and refused entry unless they are PLA troops!  One Canadian tells me “You got ‘em PLA Troops all over the coast, man, based outta Prince Rupert. A bunch of their military intel people work outta their consulate in town Vancouver and they can airlift the assault troops here in an hour, is what I been told.”  That same source went on to say That’s how that fucking traitor Trudeau’s arranged it with Beijing, man. The west coast is theirs. They’re gonna be the ones managing the curfews and all the other shit that’s gonna follow.   So, ladies and gentlemen, our neighbor and ally, Canada, under the completely fraudulent guise of protecting Chinese investments, has betrayed the United States and is permitting China to mass troops on Canada's west coast, and China is doing so - allegedly to protect their investments - but in actual fact, for use in attacking and conquering the United States.     REDEPLOYMENT OF F-22's AND F-35's to . . .  Alaska  There was a curious story a few weeks ago about how the US is redeploying F-22's and F-35's to . . . Alaska. Story Here   It didn't make any sense at the time.  Why would we put some of our most advanced fighter jets all the way up there?   Now, we seem to know!   The US Government knows what China is doing and our government is preparing to fight them off!  Those planes can fly in from behind the Chinese troops and bomb them.     CALL-UP of ONE MILLION RESERVISTS  There was another story back in March, by ABC News HERE about President Trump authorizing the Secretary of Defense to Call-up a MILLION U.S. Military Reservists.  At the time, we were told that the call-up had to do with COVID-19 and those troops would be able to help with the outbreak.     That story just didn't hold water because the COVID outbreak wasn't nearly that bad.  Now, the call-up seems to make sense.  The US Government saw that China has begun massing troops and is calling-up a MILLION U.S. Military Reservists to fight them off!     West Coast Wild Fires to chase population away?  For months, the US west coast has been seeing ferocious wildfires that have burned millions of acres, and destroyed tens-of-thousands of homes.  Just two weeks ago, earthquake guru Dutch Since accidentally stumbled upon what appear to be Directed Energy Weapons being used to start and spread those fires!  His video showed that US Satellites in space which monitor environmental conditions in the USA, picked up literal beams in the Near-infra-red spectrum, being fired at and into the wildfires.   Here's a screen shot of such beams being fired:  When those beams hit, the fires immediately grew in intensity, and spread.  Other photos - VERY MANY - have been taken by citizens on the scenes as these beams were fired and they were so shocked at seeing it, the people too photos of the beams as they took place:  Here's a slew of others: Click image to enlarge  Then, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, revealed to the American people that China and Russia have weaponized space and he specifically mentioned Directed Energy Weapons in his address to an Air Force conference.  In just the first TWO MINUTES, the Secretary of Defense repeatedly tells us that China and Russia are employing Asymmetric capabilities and he flatly states they have weaponized space with Directed Energy Weapons.  Just watch the first two minutes:  I'm sure all of you at some time or another have seen a car fire.   They get to burning pretty ferociously, right?  When have you EVER seen a car fire that causes the wheels to actually melt?  Take a look at what's been happening in the US west coast . . .  Vehicles are being MELTED in the so-called wild fires.  How can burning wood melt steel?  It can't.  The burn temperature doesn't get hot enough.   But a directed energy weapon could do it . . . and now, it looks as though that's precisely what's been happening!  But why?  Why would China want to start massive fires on our west coast?  Simple: To chase the people out.  The world knows that American citizens are ARMED to the teeth thanks to our Constitution's Second Amendment.  Famously, back in World War 2 after their attack upon Pearl Harbor, a Japanese General remarked that Americans were so heavily armed that Japan would face a gun behind every blade of grass if they ever tried to invade.  That, he said, was why Japan never invaded.  China knows this too.  So they're burning us out!   They're starting these fires to get rid of literally millions of Americans so Chinese troops WON'T face a gun behind every blade of grass.   These fires are softening-up the west coast for invasion!     UPDATE 10:12 PM EDT --  HEADS UP! DURING THIS MORNINGS INTERVIEW WITH MARIA BARTIROMO, PRESDENT TRUMP SAID... I HAVE BEEN BRINGING ALL OUR TROOPS HOME, WE NEED TO HAVE OUR TROOPS HOME FOR RUSSIA AND CHINA.     Why isn't Congress doing anything to defend us?  Where is a Declaration of war?   We've been under attack by directed energy weapons for months. It's time to attack back.  Americans are URGED to arm themselves and prepare.  Invading foreign army persons are to be shown NO QUARTER and NO MERCY.  Take no prisoners.   This is going to be a fight for our very existence.      SURVEIL THEM!  Canadians in British Columbia are encouraged to engage in ACTIVE, OPEN, DELIBERATE, SURVEILLANCE of Chinese Troops.  Take photos.  Take videos.  Go to Stanley Park and fly drones over it to grab video.  Go to Salt Spring Island and do the same.  Remember, there is no expectation of privacy for anything which is out in public.  No law exists preventing the surveillance of foreign military troops in public.  Either publish your videos to Youtube or to Brighteon where they won't get censored and send them to me at: Hal.Turner@HalTurnerRadioShow.com.  These troops need to be tracked and monitored.  Their locations must be determined and kept under watchful eye.  If military EQUIPMENT such as Tanks, Armored personnel carriers, self-propelled artillery, helicopters, or planes of any type are found, grab images and video of those too.  We need to see just how far along their activities have progressed.

,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Wednesday did not mince words on a congested conference call with Biden and federal health authorities who are seeking to prohibit domestic travel to and from the Sunshine State. DeSantis and Biden exchanged salvos of biting barbs after the criminal president said the federal government had authority to “restrict movement” of the people.  Citing concerns over the widespread proliferation of Covid-19 variants, Biden said he might have to prohibit vehicle and air traffic until the CDC and NIH were confident that currently available vaccinations had a proven efficacy against emerging strains, such as highly transmissible anomalies from the United Kingdom, Brazil, and South Africa.  Also on the call were “Deep State” Dr. Fauci and acting CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, both of whom championed Biden’s idea and told DeSantis that surging cases in Florida threatened to undermine the federal government’s expansive efforts to mitigate spread across the country. Florida, Dr. Fauci said, was the epicenter of Covid-19 mutations, and argued that new variants accounted for between 15-35% of new cases in Florida.  Walensky argued on the call that any attempt by DeSantis to resist a federally mandated travel ban would be immoral, selfish, and possibly illegal.  Biden echoed her words, and he berated DeSantis for having left Florida’s economy open during “the dark days of Covid.” Moreover, Biden claimed he had unilateral and constitutional authority to protect the nation’s health from “rogue politicians” acting in contravention of established health guidelines.  DeSantis’s initial reply was brief and blunt: “I will not comply,” he said, and then cited the CDC’s own statistics showing a nationwide decline in active Covid-19 cases.  Florida had arrested the spread of Covid-19, DeSantis argued, and accused Biden of targeting Republican states that supported Donald Trump.  “Florida absolutely will not comply,” DeSantis repeated. “Instituting a travel ban or restriction of movement would be a gross example of federal overreach with no grounding in law or science. We have Covid-19 in check, and you’re trying to exert unlawful authority over our state and its people,” he chided Biden.  Biden then tacitly threatened to withhold federal funding and to deny Florida access to Covid-19 vaccinations.  “C’mon, man, Florida needs our help, and you need vaccines, which are hard to come by, isn’t that right, Dr. Fauci,” Biden said.  The “Deep State” doctor replied in the affirmative, telling DeSantis that he expects the prevalence of the UK variant to double or triple every week to 10 days.  “Governor, do you want to be responsible for reinfecting the nation? Truth is, we don’t even know how effective current vaccines are against the UK strain.”  DeSantis told Dr. Fauci he trusted his own state health authorities over financially incentivized federal officials.  “How much do you stand to earn from these vaccines, Dr. Fauci? And, Joe, if you continue with this course of action, I will authorize the state National Guard to protect the movement of Floridians,” DeSantis said.  “Address me as Mr. President or President Biden,” Biden said.  “I will not, and you can go fuck yourself,” DeSantis said before hanging up.  In closing, it seems obvious that Team Biden favors perpetual lockdowns and a stagnant economy, keeping Americans imprisoned under a de facto state of medical martial law.

62e4d9e5,"A thorough marketing campaign for the use of low-quality masks has convinced millions of people that masks will reduce COVID-19 spread, but do they really?  State governments are enthusiastically mandating that everyone, even those who aren’t sick, wear masks when in public. While that might seem like a logical and even patriotic thing to do, what does the science actually say about mask efficacy and safety?  Top Doctors Initially Acknowledged Masks Don’t Work  In the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak, Dr. Anthony Fauci told us masks probably weren’t going to help protect us from the Wuhan virus. Joe Biden’s COVID-19 adviser Dr. Michael Osterholm similarly agreed that wearing masks is “largely” nonsense and that “trying to stop the flu [another respiratory virus] is like trying to stop the wind.”  These expert opinions were based on a meta-analysis of multiple studies about masks on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s CDC’s website. It concluded, “We did not find evidence that surgical-type face masks are effective in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission, either when worn by infected persons source control or by persons in the general community to reduce their susceptibility.”  Fauci and Osterholm were also likely aware of numerous studies concluding that masks during surgery don’t prevent wound infections from particles doctors emitted from their mouths and noses. One study found that tracer particles placed on the inside of a surgeon’s mask ended up in the surgical wound.  Another study in Clinical Orthopedics blamed redirected airflow, saying, “The wearing of a surgical face mask had no effect upon the overall operating room environmental contamination and probably work only to redirect the projectile effect of talking and breathing.” Most recently, a September 2020 meta-review concluded, “Surgical mask wearing among individuals in non-healthcare settings is not significantly associated with reduction in acute respiratory illness incidence in this meta-review.”  Much Recent Pro-Mask Research Is Deeply Flawed  The only statistically significant data on preventing viral spread is for N95 masks worn indoors when one can’t socially distance, which is not the type of mask required nor typically worn by the general public.  In favor of a few new, poorly designed studies, government leaders are ignoring the previous solid research that clearly demonstrates the typical cloth masks don’t work. The researchers in these new inferior studies somehow conclude that masks help, but you have to read the fine print: They have an unrealistic experimental design, confounding variables, and a “low certainty” of evidence.  Speaking of fine print, while the World Health Organization WHO recommends masks to the public, it acknowledges elsewhere, “At the present time, the widespread use of masks by healthy people in the community setting is not yet supported by high quality or direct scientific evidence.”  One analysis published in the well-known medical journal The Lancet concluded masks help, but the study subjects wore masks along with all other protective health measures, meaning the contribution of masks to the study result can’t be conclusive. To its credit, it rated its evidence on masks as “low certainty,” yet this study is held up as “proof” that masks work.  Other studies, such as one from Nature, had participants blow into a tube or a box while wearing and not wearing various masks. If fewer particles were emitted from the front of the mask, researchers deemed that mask to be effective. That would be great, except measuring only the forward projection of particles completely misses the aerosols that escape from the edges of the mask. A person’s fogged glasses are a clear demonstration that masks do little to contain aerosols. Masks simply “redirect airflow,” as the Clinical Orthopedics study stated.  Another “definitive” study put rats in adjacent cages separated by a small hole completely covered by a new, dry mask. This experiment does not come close to approximating the effectiveness of the moist, bacteria-laden masks people wear in public, which leak aerosols out of the edges. Comparing masks covering rat air holes to those covering human faces is comparing apples and oranges.  All of these studies also used fresh masks only for a few minutes. The authors acknowledge that when masks get moistened by breath, they might allow for increased emission of viral particles. Indeed, it has been well demonstrated that masks accumulate microorganisms.  Finally, in one case study, a pair of COVID-19-infected hairdressers worked with masks, and their clients didn’t become ill. While this case is also widely viewed as proof masks work, important details were ignored.  First, many of the hairdressers’ clients declined to get tested, so we don’t know if they contracted COVID after contact with the hairdressers. Second, the clients who were in contact with the stylists when their viral load would have been highest were not included in this case study. Third, the hairdressers obviously had mild cases, otherwise they wouldn’t have been able to nor allowed to work.  When did the science bar get so low, especially for something forced on the entire population?  Are Masks Actually Causing Harm?  “Maskne,” face rashes, “mask mouth,” and sore throats point to bacteria building up in masks due to the humid, stagnant air and changes in the oral microbiome, which can cause systemic inflammation and downstream disease. A 2015 study found that health-care workers who wore cotton face masks suffered from significantly more respiratory illness than those who wore surgical masks.  Previous research conducted by Fauci himself found that the main cause of death in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic was from bacterial pneumonia. Inhaling higher bacterial counts with every breath sounds like an especially bad idea.  The WHO specifically recommends against wearing a mask while exercising because “masks may reduce the ability to breathe comfortably. Sweat can make the mask become wet more quickly which makes it difficult to breathe and promotes the growth of microorganisms.”  Abundant research demonstrates masks cannot help prevent the spread of coronavirus, while much recent research claiming to support masks is weak and poorly designed. Frequent mask use by the general population increases bacteria and dust in our mouth and airways. A government mandating that everyone wear a mask based on such low-quality evidence is reckless and potentially harmful.  For now, let’s stick with the measures that do help: social distancing, hand hygiene, and avoiding chronic disease. Only don a fresh, clean N95 mask for short periods of time when you’re unavoidably close to others indoors.",Many Studies Find That Cloth Masks Do Not Stop Viruses Like COVID,false,
fff1cb16,"Natural News A 2012 study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases finds that children who received inactivated influenza vaccines were 440% more likely relative risk: 4.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.31-14.8 to acquire infections of respiratory viral pathogens which are not influenza. With the aggressive push for influenza immunizations now under way, the medical establishment may be setting up children to be extremely vulnerable to coronavirus infections. Titled, “Increased Risk of Noninfluenza Respiratory Virus Infections Associated With Receipt of Inactivated Influenza Vaccine,” the study is found at this link at the National Library of Medicine: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3404712/ The study finds that flu shots quite literally inactivate parts of the human immune system, rendering the child more vulnerable to coronavirus infections. “Being protected against influenza, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine recipients may lack temporary non-specific immunity that protected against other respiratory viruses,” the study authors write. The study authors explain that the influenza vaccine works to prevent influenza virus infections, but at the same time it makes children more susceptible to other respiratory infections. Since the Infection Fatality Rate IFR for seasonal influenza is so low around 0.024%, which is not a typo, and the Infection Fatality Rate of covid-19 infections is at least one order of magnitude higher, it raises the obvious question: Would it save more lives of children to avoid administering flu shots this year and therefore reduce their vulnerability to covid-19, which has a far higher fatality rate? The study, which was conducted in 2009, observed the outcomes of 115 children aged 6 – 16 years. The study also used a placebo group and found that placebo made “no statistically significant difference” in the risk of acute respiratory infection risk. But children who received influenza vaccines had a much higher risk of respiratory infections. Even more shockingly, the study also found no difference in the risk of seasonal influenza infections between those children who were vaccinated vs. those who weren’t. In other words, the influenza vaccine offered no protection against the flu, but it created increased vulnerability to other respiratory infections. No benefits, just increased risks. “There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of confirmed seasonal influenza infection between recipients of TIV or placebo,” the study explains. You can see the increased number of respiratory infections in this chart. Note the “TIV” column means those children who were vaccinated with an influenza vaccine: The conclusion is that influenza vaccines make children more susceptible to other respiratory viral infections. From the study, which took place more than a decade before the arrival of the covid-19 pandemic: We identified a statistically significant increased risk of noninfluenza respiratory virus infection among TIV recipients Table 3, including significant increases in the risk of rhinovirus and coxsackie/echovirus infection, which were most frequently detected in March 2009, immediately after the peak in seasonal influenza activity in February 2009. The study authors point out that the influenza vaccine, “could increase influenza immunity at the expense of reduced immunity to noninfluenza respiratory viruses, by some unknown biological mechanism,” although they also state more research is needed because some of the self-reporting of symptoms may have introduced “artifacts” which could sway the numbers. Nevertheless, the study authors also state that this phenomenon of “viral interference” is well known: Participants who received TIV would have been protected against influenza in February 2009 but then would not have had heightened nonspecific immunity in the following weeks… The phenomenon of virus interference has been well known in virology for >60 years [24–27]. Ecological studies have reported phenomena potentially explained by viral interference [3–11]… Interference in respiratory and gastrointestinal infections has been reported after receipt of live oral poliovirus vaccine [29–32]. Those who push flu shots may be worsening the coronavirus pandemic The upshot of this research is that those who are pushing flu shots for children may in fact be worsening the coronavirus pandemic, creating “perfect storm” conditions for children to become carriers of the Wuhan coronavirus that causes covid-19. This is consistent with the fact that we now know the medical establishment has acted to deliberately worsen covid-19 fatalities by, for example, conspiring the destroy the credibility of hydroxychloroquine, working to maximize fatalities in order to reap a windfall of profits from the coronavirus vaccine. Yes, the medical and science establishment quite literally arranges for more people to die in order to keep the coronavirus fear alive, resulting in more demand for high-profit vaccines. As always, it’s all about the money. As Gary Heavin recently wrote in a warning to America, Big Pharma operatives are “accessories to murder.” How does Big Pharma have so much control over the dissemination of this information or should I say propaganda? Well, the same answer pops up again, money. Big Pharma gave $2 billion dollars during the last election cycle to US politicians. Big AG, the military/security complex and big oil each gave only a paltry $1.0 billion dollars to buy the votes of our political leadership. The MSM counts Big Pharma’s advertising revenue at up to 80% of their income. The internet’s “masters of the universe” also kowtow to Big Pharma’s influence and advertising dollars by censoring anyone who tries to tell the American people the truth about Covid 19. It certainly appears that anyone who is complicit in this Great Deception, a deception that is designed to kill and terrify enough people to ultimately beg for an experimental vaccine, well, these people would be accessories to murder. Flu shots are being hyped to suppress immune systems and create an explosion in coronavirus infections Flu shots, it seems, are one more way the medical establishment can literally murder children and adults, creating widespread vulnerability to the coronavirus pandemic which will no doubt surge back this Fall as flu shots work to suppress the immune systems of millions. Recognize that the people pushing flu shots are medical murderers, and many are deliberately trying to kill as many people as possible to create demand for the high-profit coronavirus vaccines that are about to be unleashed on America, probably before the end of this year. It’s the perfect crime: Manufacture vaccines that suppress the immune system right in the middle of a pandemic, causing more infections and deaths, leading to more calls for mandatory vaccines. The drug companies will cash in to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars while innocent children and adults all across America needlessly suffer and die. As usual, it’s all about the money, and the vaccine / drug cartels are murderous, criminal regimes that twisted science Dr. Fauci? to maximize profits at any cost.

ca2ff44e,"One in three people with dementia who pay for their own care have to sell their home, an exclusive poll reveals today.  Eight in ten people think politicians have failed to tackle the social care crisis, the survey found, and two-thirds believe the current system – which denies funding to anyone who owns a home or has £23,250 in savings – is unfair. Eight in ten also said the NHS should fund dementia support.  The Daily Mail is campaigning for ministers to end the dementia care cost betrayal, with support flooding in from readers, charities, doctors and MPs.  As pressure mounted on politicians to deliver reform:  Experts last night called on Boris Johnson to match Tory leadership rival Jeremy Hunt’s promise to act;  Former home secretary David Blunkett, writing in today’s newspaper, admitted Labour failed to take action while in power;  Readers continued to write in with heartbreaking stories of the unfair tax on dementia.  Labour MP Clive Betts, chairman of the local government select committee, said: ‘This poll shows how unfair the whole system is.  ‘If you are an older person who has a heart attack, your medical care is paid for.  ‘But if you get dementia, and own your own home and need care, you have to pay for that care yourself and many have to sell their house to do so. It is completely unacceptable and it needs to be brought to an end.’  Experts called on Boris Johnson to match Tory leadership rival Jeremy Hunt’s promise to act  Sally Copley, of the Alzheimer’s Society, which has led support for the Mail’s campaign, said: ‘No-one should be forced to sell a home they have worked their whole lives for just because they develop one health condition and not another. This cruel lottery has to end.  ‘The next prime minister must release plans of how he will find a sustainable funding solution for the social care system in the long term, which doesn’t rely on the houses of people with dementia to pay for it.’  The poll of 1,013 adults, carried out by Survation on behalf of the Mail, lays bare the impact on families.  Some 26 per cent of respondents said a member of their family or a friend had been diagnosed with dementia. Of those, 52 per cent said they had to pay for their care, of which an alarming 31 per cent had to sell their home to do so.  Some 27 per cent said they had spent more than £50,000 on care and 6 per cent said the bill had exceeded an astonishing £100,000. Nearly seven in ten of respondents said they would support cutting foreign aid to better fund social care. A third said they would back a small increase in income tax or national insurance.  Boris Johnson arrives at an address in Westminster  The Mail is calling for the urgent formation of a cross-party group to tackle the funding crisis – tasked with dealing with the issue once and for all.  In the meantime, the Government must set up a ‘dementia fund’ to help families pay the extra cost of supporting those affected. And it must end the ‘double subsidy’ which sees those deemed able to afford to pay for care subsidising the costs of support for those funded by the state.  Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: ‘It’s fantastic to see the Daily Mail taking up the cudgels on behalf of the hundreds of thousands who are losing out massively because of the Government’s failure to act on social care. The current system is not only incredibly stingy, it is grossly underfunded too, so some people are struggling to get even their meagre rights recognised and their needs met.  ‘Our new prime minister should firstly put out the fire which threatens social care today, and then get good people around him to help build something better, fairer and more fire-proof.’  Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘We are pleased to see this campaign directly tackling some of the barriers for patients with dementia. We hope it goes some way to finally addressing what has long been an unacceptable situation in England.’  Labour MP Debbie Abrahams, co-chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on dementia, said: ‘People with dementia are faced with higher costs for their care, costing an average 15 per cent more than if they had standard social care. Social care is in crisis and it leaves people with dementia and their families struggling within a broken and unfair system.  ‘The injustice of people battling to get care, on top of battling the devastating effects of dementia can’t go on.’ The Department of Health and Social Care said: ‘People who need social care should not have to pay more than they can reasonably afford and we introduced reforms aimed at preventing people being forced to sell their homes to pay for their own care in their lifetime.  ‘We will set out our plans to reform the system at the earliest opportunity to protect people from high and unpredictable costs.’  'Mum worked all her life. She paid taxes. Then her home was sold to pay for her care – and subsidise those who didn’t save. It’s so very unfair, I despair'  It’s just days since we launched our campaign to reform dementia care and we’ve been inundated with your heart-breaking letters about how you’ve had to sell prized family homes to pay for the care of loved ones, while those who have never saved have had their care paid for by the state. Here are a selection of your anguished accounts — and write to us at dementiacare@dailymail.co.uk to tell us your own story...  When my late mother, Peggy, was diagnosed with dementia, I couldn’t look after her as I already had to care at home for my husband, Jim, who had Alzheimer’s.  Sadly, she had to go into residential care, selling her lovely home in the Cotswolds in 2005 for £176,000 to pay for the costs.  After nine years in a home, all that money, as well as her pension, was eventually spent on her care — a total of approximately £220,000.  She died in 2015, having used up her entire savings on helping subsidise others funded by the local authority at reduced rates.  Penalised: Ann Reid centre with her mother Peggy left and father Bryan  Pictured: Ann Reid's parents in happier days  It is clear to everyone who has watched a loved-one battle with dementia that there simply isn’t enough money being spent on funding care.  It’s completely unfair that people can work hard all their lives and save up for a home — often by not going on holidays — and be penalised for it if they are diagnosed with dementia.  Paying thousands every year isn’t even a guarantee of good care. In 2008, I remember going to visit my mother and found a nasty note left by a nurse, telling her not to bang on the table.  I was absolutely disgusted, and there’s no sign that our care system is improving.  The only way we are going to fix the dementia care crisis is if our Government puts it at the top of its agenda.  Ever since my mother was diagnosed, politicians have made countless promises about how things are going to get better. But time after time, their words have proved meaningless.  One can only despair.  ANN REID, Eastbourne, East Sussex.  AFTER A LIFE OF HARD WORK  When my mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2015, she was initially cared for by her husband, my stepfather.  But after he died a year later, her dementia became worse and we had to move her into residential care. To fund the £986 per week costs, we had to sell Mum’s bungalow — and spend all of her savings. To this day, we have spent £118,800 on Mum’s care.  She worked hard throughout her life. Why was she left to fend for herself after a life-time of paying taxes and National Insurance?  SUE MORRISSEY, Brighton, East Sussex.  The Mail’s articles and letters about those suffering have brought back painful memories of my mother and my mother-in-law, who were both diagnosed with this dreadful illness.

I finally saved enough to buy my house, only for it to be taken from me to fund my wife’s care. Meanwhile, those who saved nothing get financial assistance. I am now 83 and feel ashamed with the way we are being treated — especially since I’ve spent my life helping make this country the place it is.  A. ROBERTS, Chelmsford, Essex.  Selling mum's home  My mother was diagnosed with vascular dementia about four years ago.  For the next two years, my sister and I tried to support her at home but after she nearly burnt the house down we decided she was safer in a residential home.  Now, after paying £80,000 in costs, we have had to sell the family home to fund her care.  Our parents worked hard all of their lives, saving and investing, believing they were leaving a legacy to their children.  Instead their money is being used to subsidise other people’s treatment.  LES HITCH, Ware, Hertfordshire.  Our vanishing savings  My husband was diagnosed with vascular dementia in 2010. I managed to look after him until my own health deteriorated, when our family persuaded me to put him into care.  He is now 92 and remarkably fit. He no longer recognises me but appears to be contented.  Meanwhile, his £957 per week costs mean our savings are rapidly vanishing.  RHODA MILLAR, Leamington Spa, Warks.  My uncle Felix spent the last two years of his life suffering from dementia in a nursing home in Newry, Northern Ireland. He had worked all his life as a farmer, remained a bachelor and had hoped to pass on his four farms to his brother and sister.  But in 2017, his health deteriorated and he had to go into residential care. To pay for his care, his house and farms were rented out.  By the time he passed away after 17 months in May 2018, we had spent over £50,000 on his care.  PATRICIA O’HARE, Northern Ireland.  And you also expressed your fury...  Almost every family will, at some time, have someone suffering from dementia. Why can’t we maintain just half the foreign aid budget and plough the rest into dementia research?  D. Marks, Featherstone, W. Yorks.  A CARE FUND NEEDED  Everyone earning over a certain amount should have to pay in to a designated dementia care fund, with graduated payments based on their level of income.  J. SAYERS, Hastings, East Sussex.  It is about time the Government ring-fenced part of our taxes and spent it solely on dementia care.  MAIR KENNEDY, address supplied  My biggest worry  I am 75. I left school at 15, as many did in the Fifties and Sixties. Since then, I have worked every day in various forms of employment. I finally retired at 70. Now, I worry that everything I have saved could be spent on care.  ALAN HARMER, address supplied.  I left school when I was 16 and joined the Royal Navy, where I served for seven years.  After meeting the girl of my dreams, we got married and bought a house.  I’m now 83, living on my pension after my wife died last year. If I develop dementia, I will have to sell my home to fund my care. Why did I bother to strive all those years? Why did I bother to be self-sufficient?  ALAN JACOBS, Biddenham, Bedfordshire.  Cross the border!  As the Royal Commission’s recommendation for free care was rejected by the Government in 2000 but adopted in Scotland, I suggest we should take people suffering from dementia over the border.  After all, Scotland costs all of us through our taxes for this preferential treatment of their suffering old people.  Susan Middleton, Keighley, West Yorkshire.  The wrong priorities  The dementia care scandal simply shows that the majority of our politicians are happier splashing billions of our cash on foreign aid than looking after our own.  B. EKINS, Chessington, Surrey.  Hospitals treat for free those people who have smoked or consume copious amounts of alcohol. I have done neither. In fact, I have cost the NHS nothing to treat illnesses that could justifiably be regarded as, at least in part, self-inflicted.  But I do have one condition I have been unable to control.  I am ageing.  Should I have the temerity to develop dementia, I shall be judged so responsible for the illness that I shall be expected to fund my own treatment.  How does that make any sort of sense?  SUSAN YOUNG, Coulsdon, Surrey.  What’s terrible is the effect this dementia tax is having on working-class families.  Those who have scrimped and saved on meagre wages to pay off mortgages throughout their lives, but were still lucky enough to have saved something towards their retirement, are having it guzzled up by this utterly unfair system.  J. HAGUE, Wakefield, West Yorkshire.  Isn’t it amazing that the Government can pay for dementia care for people who have never contributed towards the National Health Service, and make the people who have contributed to the system all their working lives pick up the bill?  G. BRENNAN, Birmingham.  Profligate politicians  If we reined in the excesses of and the likes of profligate politicians and the Department for International Development, perhaps we could start to look after our own.  COLIN WILLIAMS, Devon.  As well as sorting out the disparity in what people pay for dementia care, we also need to ask why care homes have become so expensive.  It’s a scandal.  CASPER GORNIOK, Surrey.  It terrified me  I am in my late 60s and the thought of being diagnosed with dementia and losing everything I have worked for fills me with terror.  WILLIAM ROSS, address supplied.  Why should a person who has been frugal be worse off than someone who hasn’t, despite both having paid into the same system?  Dementia care funding is completely unfair and needs a thorough overhaul so that all are treated the same.  KEITH MARTIN,  New Milton, Hampshire  Diagnosed at just 58, I fear I’ll lose all I’ve worked for...  By Wendy Mitchell  Can you imagine being diagnosed with young-onset dementia at the age of 58?  The debilitating mental effects of the disease are well-documented, and the stress of living with it is hard enough for anyone.  But for people with young-onset dementia, you don’t just fear losing your memories. You fear losing your future.  I would know — for five years ago, at just 58, I received my diagnosis.  Now, as my condition accelerates, I fear that the future I had once mapped out for myself is a mere pipe dream.  For years, I was encouraged by successive governments to save my money wisely. I didn’t smoke, didn’t drink, and always counted my pennies when they came.  Despairing: Wendy Mitchell, who worked as an NHS hospital manager, at home in Yorkshire  One day, I was told I would even be a homeowner.  And if I had a bit left over, perhaps I could leave it to my daughters.  But now, thanks to the current dementia care system’s insistence that people like me need to spend almost all our savings on care, I often ask myself: ‘Why did I bother?’  For everything that I worked hard for, including my house, will one day have to pay for care costs; care that’s often inadequate and degrading.  That’s my future... This is my life.  I spent 20 years working as an NHS hospital manager in Yorkshire. But when I’ll need the NHS most, it won’t be there for me.  Only a wealthy minority can afford the luxury of well-staffed, well-supported homes. Even if I sold my house, the sum I would get would only keep me in a good, reputable care home for a while.  Then what? Will I be carted off to a dusty corner somewhere?  When it comes to people with dementia, the Government has made it clear that we are not a priority.  It’s more than happy to cause distress and financial hardship for those caring for loved ones, just to save a few million pounds. Yet the trauma experienced by hard-working families is costing lives.  We have known for decades that our ageing population is constantly increasing. So why have consecutive governments failed to address this social care problem?  If I had been diagnosed with cancer, I would have had an automatic right to free care up until my death.  Why should I be punished financially for having dementia? Why should I have to sell my house to cover care costs, when other conditions are supported? Is dementia really less worthy?  The much-needed Green Paper on social care was finally promised back in April, after a two-year delay. Yet our current Government has delayed it six times. Six!  That review was supposed to bring us hope. But in its place, pain, frustration and financial ruin have run rampant.  This is a disgrace. We should all hang our heads in shame.  Wendy Mitchell is the author of Somebody I Used To Know.  Scandal of my sister embarrasses us all  By Lord Blunkett  David Blunkett's half-sister, Doreen, who had Dementia  Just over ten years ago, I received a note from then Labour Health Secretary Alan Johnson kindly asking if I would attend the launch of his ground-breaking plan to resolve the dementia care crisis.  He knew I was an ardent critic of what was then the care system, which hung dementia patients out to dry, and that I would support his demand for a £150 million pot from the Treasury which could be used to boost dementia services.  It was an admirable demand — one that, in 2009, we felt was long overdue.If you had told me then that our rotting dementia care system would remain untreated, I would have laughed you out of the room.  Even in the late Seventies, when I chaired the social services committee of Sheffield City Council, we were aware our country’s dementia care system was woefully inadequate.  At Johnson’s policy launch, he asked me to speak but, thanks to some mix up, mistakenly introduced me as the vice-president of the Alzheimer’s Society. It turned out to be a fortunate error, however, as afterwards the organisation’s chief executive actually sought me out and offered me the role. I was thrilled.  But Alzheimer’s soon came to play a different role in my life.  For little did I know at the time that my half-sister, Doreen, who died last year, was on the verge of developing dementia. Her diagnosis hammered home the debilitating impact that this disease can have on an individual with it, as well as their family.  Just imagine being told you have dementia, realising why boiling a kettle, or using a cash machine, has been posing a challenge it never did before; why the words that once sprung to mind so easily now suddenly elude you.  Doreen's diagnosis hammered home the debilitating impact that this disease can have on an individual with it, as well as their family pictured: David Blunkett, 2005  Then comes the second, equally frustrating blow: you are told that despite having a life-changing condition — despite the fact that you have paid taxes all your life — the NHS won’t cover your social care.  And so for many families, a diagnosis of dementia is often accompanied by financial punishment.  This is what most terrified Doreen and her husband, Jack, who was physically ill before her condition deteriorated.  Rather than go into residential care, and risk having to spend all their savings and sell their house to pay for it, they coped with care at home for as long as possible.  Eventually, Jack’s deteriorating health meant they could no longer manage, and in 2015 they moved into residential care.  Jack died shortly after, but Doreen spent almost four years in care, which forced the sale of their modest home — an asset which for so many like her is their whole life savings. Dementia is, and has long been, a most discriminated-against condition, which is why the Mail’s campaign is so important.  Pictured: Lord Blunkett with guide dog Cosby  While the NHS provides free treatment for those diagnosed with heart disease or cancer — and rightly so — people with dementia are left at the mercy of a broken social care system. The absence of financial support for every person with dementia should embarrass us all.  As the countless tragic cases highlighted by this paper have revealed, people are having to sell their family homes and use life savings just to pay for their basic care. And it’s not just people with dementia paying the price — the NHS is, too.  According to Alzheimer’s Society research, in just one year more than 70,000 people with dementia were forced to go to A&E because inadequate or scarce social care left them unprotected from avoidable emergencies such as falls, infections and dehydration — at an estimated cost to the NHS of £400 million.  If we want to remedy the betrayal of dementia patients, we must act now. For although the past 20 years has been filled with political promises, successive governments have failed to take much-needed action.  As soon as he was elected in 1997, Tony Blair claimed that he did not want ‘children to be brought up in a country where the only way pensioners can get long-term care is by selling their home’.  A Royal Commission was convened, but its recommendation for free long-term personal care was rejected a year later.  And when Alan Johnson — whose support for a ‘National Care Service’ was also taken up by his immediate successor Andy Burnham — tried to revolutionise social care, Labour’s defeat in the election a year later meant their proposals were also shelved.  In the years since, from the Dilnot review’s proposals in 2011 for a cap on care payments to Theresa May’s call in the last election for the current asset level of £23,250 — above which patients must fund themselves — to be raised, every attempt to improve our care system has fallen on deaf ears.  The 850,000 people in the UK living with dementia deserve better. Rather than delay the current Green Paper on social care for a seventh time in two years, our Government must finally commit to long-term social care reform and find a way to sustainably fund dementia care for the future.  There is no other choice.  By 2021, one million people in the UK will have dementia, and they will all need good-quality social care. Yet as it stands, the number of care homes is actually in decline — from 18,000 to 16,600 in the past nine years.  It’s already taking its toll on our finances: people with dementia have spent one million days in hospital beds when they should have been in care or nursing homes — costing the NHS more than £340 million.  This is the stark reality our new Prime Minister will face.  To end the dementia care crisis, he — whoever he is — must act. We have no time to lose.

,"As most of my followers on social media and Substack must know by now, I have spent a considerable amount of time the last two years trying to discover the actual ingredients of the new COVID vaccines. The reason is simple: Big Pharma has gone to considerable trouble to hide them. Do the Big Pharma companies want to submit the vaccines to independent analysis? They do not! Do the Big Pharma companies want to disclose all the ingredients? They do not! Do the Big Pharma companies have any liability for lying to the public about the proprietary ingredients in their vaccines? They do not. We have a leaked copy of the legal agreement that Big Pharma companies (allegedly) have forced nation-states to sign in order to get the new COVID vaccines. These contracts include indemnification clauses that no sane human being would ever sign. This copy leaked from Albania: One thing is certain: Big Pharma is not standing behind these products. They’re totally experimental and untested and so forth — so why are the world’s governments so hellbent on injecting their citizens with this stuff? I received a tip regarding some of these ingredients, and so I did what nobody in American corporate journalism does anymore: I checked the primary sources. Allow me to share my secret and very profound methodology: 1) I went to the MODERNA website. 2) I clicked to the PATENTS page. 3) I found PATENT US 10,703,789 4) I conducted a keyword search for something called: Luciferase. Such are the complex technical skills which have been lost by corporate journalists. So what did I find there? Well, sitting on page 46 in table 4, you will see that I found something called Luciferase: What’s Luciferase? Luciferase is an enzyme that can produce bioluminescence. (It can make things glow, basically.) That’s why Luciferase is commonly used in the biomedical industry. It’s used to tag very tiny things like cells or proteins so that you can track them. It tags things so you can track them. Was Luciferase listed as an ingredient in the COVID vaccines by Big Pharma? No it was not. (You can check here at the CDC website.) So the next question becomes: why would Big Pharma not disclose that Luciferase is an ingredient in the vaccines - since it’s clearly listed (in at least one patent from one company) as being used? The reason is rather ominous: Big Pharma has big plans for Luciferase and Big Government has big plans for it too. The U.S. military’s technology arm DARPA is currently fighting with Moderna over the ownership of the COVID vaccine because DARPA has “funded an implantable biochip” that could be used “to deploy” it: Despite this, however, one obstacle to the deployment of Moderna’s vaccine is the method of delivery. While Moderna is developing its own system, it’s unlikely to get Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval any time soon. Enter Profusa, which is developing a nanoscale biochip that can detect symptoms of an infection. Profusa’s biochip is made using a technology called “hydrogels” that were a product of the “In Vivo Nanoplatforms” (IVN) program that DARPA’s Biological Technologies Office (BTO) launched in 2014 to develop implantable nanotechnologies. These hydrogels are soft, flexible nanomachines that are injected beneath the skin to perform monitoring. This hydrogel includes a specially engineered molecule that sends a fluorescent signal outside the body when it begins to fight infection. This signal can then be detected by a sensor attached to the skin that can then be sent to an app or even to a doctor’s website. Why is the U.S. military working with vaccine companies to create micro-chips (that’s “hydrogels” or “nanotech”!) that will send a “fluorescent signal” (that’s Luciferase!) detectable by an app on your smartphone? When did DARPA get involved in public health policy exactly? That strange question leads to other strange questions like: why did the Pentagon fund the Wuhan Lab of Virology to “study” weaponizing bat coronaviruses? Neither DARPA nor the Pentagon are well known for being leaders in health care, to say the very least. In fact, Big Pharma and Big Government have big plans for future vaccine shots that have “dissolvable needles” and quantum dot tattoos along with other amazing technology like embedding vaccine records beneath the skin of your children with invisible ink. According to one article: “Along with the vaccine, a child would be injected with a bit of dye that is invisible to the naked eye but easily seen with a special cell-phone filter, combined with an app that shines near-infrared light onto the skin.” That article was written in 2019: that’s just before the COVID crisis. That leads me to another thought: COVID-19 seems to be a very convenient “accidental lab leak” from China for introducing new technology. Under the cover of vaccinating people, we are really preparing to tag and track people. The once free nations of the West are testing a new authoritarian system of total control under the guise of public health. Just look at Australia or New Zealand or Canada or Italy to see how basic civil rights have been suspended indefinitely and a pseudo-medical tyranny has been installed. The Great Reset is being implemented with the lie that it’s all about “protecting your health.” Our military and intelligence agencies are not confronting China — they're copying China. A totalitarian nightmare is being imported into free countries through surveillance technologies. You don’t have to be a Christian to understand that such technology will be used to build a global surveillance state. The vaccine mandates have already led to vaccine passports. The vaccine passports are basically QR codes to track you by connecting to your smartphone. This will inevitably lead very soon to biometric ID embedded into your body. You won’t be able to enter restaurants or buy groceries or go to work without it. As the Bible says: no one will be able to buy or sell anything except those that have the mark. You will know the mark by its name, which is the name of the beast: the enemy of all mankind who, before he fell, was an angel of light named Lucifer. That’s why “Luciferase” should send a chill down your spine. So I sent out the following tweet to my followers (with a video showing the Luciferase patent information) earlier this week: This one tweet was sufficient, apparently, to get the word “Luciferase” trending on Twitter. (I didn’t notice at the time because I was busy covering the Glenn Youngkin victory on election night.) It was not until the next day that it became clear this one tweet had stirred up all the Big Pharma bots working remotely from Beijing. The largest producer of misinformation in America, The Washington Post, ran a piece on my tweet where I was branded a “COVID conspiracy theorist.” The Daily Beast ran a piece and then ran a second piece. Something called The Hill ran a piece. The forgotten boomer finance magazine Forbes got involved. Vanity Fair, the perfume ad magazine, did a little column on it. Then it became an international thing with The Independent and The Daily Mail chiming in. Now you have to ask yourself: are my tweets about vaccine ingredients really making headline news around the world? I checked with my husband first to see if I was indeed that famous. His response was disappointing. He told me: “At best, you’re semi-famous.” When corporate media outlets around the English-speaking world all start to scream in such coordinated fashion, you know you’ve hit a nerve. Why would they suddenly go crazy over the COVID vaccine ingredients? It’s because Big Journalism is being paid by Big Pharma to not disclose the truth. In fact, Big Pharma is paying Big Journalism to actively hide the truth around the world. Why do you think the COVID journalist Alex Berenson got kicked off Twitter? Why did the corporate media unleash a hate campaign against feminist icon Naomi Wolf? Why isn’t ex-Pfizer chief scientist Dr. Michael Yeadon allowed to speak? How is it possible that the inventor of mRNA vaccines himself, Dr. Robert Malone, is not a household name around the world? You know the answer: they have all warned us about the dangers of the new COVID vaccines. They have been silenced by Big Tech and Big Pharma because they have all dared to tell the truth. They are not alone. How many thousands have been banned or suspended already by Big Tech for questioning the COVID vaccines in our supposedly free nation? How many of your civil rights, your constitutional rights, can they trample before your very eyes? America is no longer a constitutional republic: it’s more like a corporate oligarchy where Big Pharma and Big Tech and Big Government tell you every day what you’re allowed to do on Zoom calls from the CDC with Dr. Fauci. They’re not even pretending anymore. This is something like Day 575 of “15 days to slow the spread.” Our so-called civil servants and elected officials are never going to give up their new “emergency powers” on their own. They mean to rule over us, and everybody knows it. That’s why the COVID-19 pandemic is being used to force everyone to get the new vaccines. That’s why natural immunity doesn’t count to anyone in the medical community. That’s why religious exemptions have disappeared at your work, along with medical exemptions. That’s why Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine (and every other therapeutic drug) were swiftly outlawed. That’s why your 5 year old child will be “encouraged” and then coerced and then forced to take the jab, just as you were “encouraged” and then coerced and then forced to take the jab. That’s why the global vaccination campaign never stops when the already vaccinated start to get sick with COVID, or young boys suddenly die from heart inflammation, or world famous soccer players collapse on TV in the middle of games. That’s why health data (whether from Israel or Sweden or Florida or your local hospital) is totally irrelevant. The vaccine is being forced on everyone because the vaccine and the vaccine passport are the essential tools of a global surveillance system that will end everyone’s basic human freedom.",What is Luciferase?,false,115861246182543293909142883694767979285
,"A military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay has convicted Microsoft Founder Bill Gates on charges including child trafficking, pedophilia, conspiracy, money laundering, murder, and public health endangerment—the conclusion of five days of heated testimony that repeatedly saw Vice Adm. John G. Hannink of the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps square off against attorney David Baluarte.  The fireworks continued Wednesday morning as Vice Adm. Hannink offered into evidence additional proof of Gates’ illicit ties to the vaccine industry. Documents obtained from Gates’ personal server outlined how he in 2011 distributed vaccines “carrying serious side effects up to and including death” to 41,000 children in poverty-stricken India, after meeting “mild” resistance from vaccine distributors in the U.S. Gates claimed the vaccination granted absolute immunity against a strain of “super polio” that was ravaging the impoverished.  Rather than inoculate recipients against polio, the vaccine exacerbated it and left over 40,000 children crippled or dead. And while cases of polio indeed were on the rise, the mysterious “super polio” was pure fiction, invented by Gates and a consortium of international vaccine distributors. Gates even travelled to India to help administer the product, which was often given orally, as a sign of good faith.  “By his own documents, Gates and his people had waged a massive marketing campaign to convince the people of India that his “super polio” was resilient to current vaccinations and that only his product, which he personally endorsed, could stave off the imaginary, virulent strain. He had the audacity to handfeed his poison to innocent children,” Vice Adm. Hannink addressed the tribunal.  Baluarte objected: “Let’s pretend a moment that this court is just. Let’s further pretend these outlandish tales are true. How, tell me, can an American military court prosecute for crimes against foreigners on foreign soil?”  “If all things were equal, that would be correct,” Vice Adm. Hannink admitted. “But all things are not equal. American missionaries worked alongside medical staff in India. Some of those American missionaries had young children—children who took the Gates vaccine.”  Six of six children, Vice Adm. Hannink said, developed complete and irreversible paralysis, followed by cerebral hemorrhaging and death within 90 days of inoculation.  Since the children were American citizens, born to American parents, the military had authority to prosecute Gates for their deaths, as is stipulated in the Insurrection Act of 1807, which Donald J. Trump activated prior to leaving office.  “Gates’ diabolical ventures didn’t stop with India,” Vice Adm. Hannink told the 3-officer panel. “Four years later, he repeated his so-called humanitarian mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo—that time claiming he’d developed a cure for HIV. And while we can’t prove any Americans died of that drug, we know at least 27,000 Africans did—and this all points to motive.”  Vice Adm. Hannink pivoted to more current events, questioning Gates’ relationship to Dr. Anthony Fauci.  “You met privately with Fauci five times, at his home and yours, between December 2019 and July 2020. Your own documents discussed ‘donating’ tens of millions of dollars to pharmaceutical manufacturers in exchange for getting 10 times your ‘investment’ back once vaccines were marketed. In your own words, Fauci approved of the idea. If you’re such a philanthropist, why were you expecting kickbacks?” Vice Adm. Hannink said.  Gates’ lawyer instructed him to not answer the question.  “And did you not discuss placing what you referred to as a ‘nano-centric biometric recorder’ into vaccines—a chip, as it were, that would send biomedical data of recipients back to the vaccine manufacturers and to the NIH and to the CDC without the recipient’s knowledge?” Vice Adm. Hannink went on. “This invasion of privacy—and we are working to determine if this took place and the scope—is just another of example of Gates’ madness. We believe the Office of Military Commissions has offered enough prove to convict the accused and sentence him to death. But that decision is in your hands,” he told the 3-officer panel.  The officers needed not one minute to reach a unanimous decision; they found Gates guilty on all charges and asked that he be hanged for his atrocities. Vice Adm. Hannink set an execution date of October 5, 2021.  (Visited 273,754 times, 10 visits today)",Military Convicts Bill Gates,false,204168055253944555338677855725036860837
,"The ongoing COVID-19 nonsense here in the United States exists solely and exclusively because our governments have failed to use the correct treatment.  They used so-called ""vaccines"" when Japan has just proven, in less than ONE MONTH, that Ivermectin can wipe out the disease. Sweden's Public Health Agency on Wednesday recommended a temporary halt to the use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine among young adults, citing concerns over rare side effects to the heart. It said the pause should initially be in force until December 1, explaining that it had received evidence of an increased risk of side effects such as inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) and inflammation of the pericardium (pericarditis). {link to CBS News (Secure)] Finland, Denmark and Norway have also moved away from the COVID vaccines. Finland last Thursday joined Sweden, Denmark and Norway in recommending against use of Moderna Inc.’s Covid-19 vaccine in younger age groups, citing risks of rare cardiovascular side effects they said warranted the precautionary steps. Finland’s Institute for Health and Welfare said last Thursday it would pause use of the Moderna vaccine among men under the age of 30, following a similar step last Wednesday by Swedish regulators. Denmark last Wednesday said it wouldn’t offer the Moderna vaccine to under-18s as a precautionary measure. Norway on Wednesday advised that all under-18s shouldn’t be given the Moderna vaccine, even if they had already received one dose, and recommended that men under 30 consider getting the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech instead. Norwegian officials cited U.S., Canadian and Nordic data, saying the absolute risks remain low and calling the advice “a precautionary measure.” The European Medicines Agency said Thursday that new preliminary data from the Nordic countries supports a warning the agency adopted in July that inflammatory heart conditions called myocarditis and pericarditis can occur in very rare cases following vaccination with Covid-19 shots made by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech. By far, however, the absolute superstar among foreign nations dealing with COVID is Japan.

Just so you understand the timeline. By September deaths from the COVID-19 Vaccine jabs were being investigated. At roughly that time, the vials were under scrutiny and metal ""magnetic"" material was found in them. Very shortly thereafter, the Japanese minister of health announced doctors could prescribe Ivermectin. A month later, the Western press is shocked that COVID has all but disappeared from the island. Get it? Understand? This is what it looks like in a country that still has rule of law. The governemnt responds to reports of death and contaminated vaxes, moves to real treatment, people get better, and the virus disappears. Now compare that to what is happening in the United States and in Australia and New Zealand.  All three countries are in dismal failure in their handling of COVID-19, and that failure has resulted in staggering loss of freedom and destruction of commerce. This is the biggest news story right now. Japan has ended COVID. It did it after it stopped the vax rollout and went to Ivermectin. Period. Hard stop. Hal Turner Editorial Opinion If your government really wanted to end COVID, if that was its true goal, it would do what Japan did. You can use Japan as a case study any time someone starts yammering some crap about how the vax is about helping you help yourself from getting others sick with what they've been vaxed against. You use it as a case study when they try to make some lame argument about how the government is really really really trying its best to end COVID and it is the MAGA crowd that is causing the variants and keeping the virus around. Japan stopped vaxing.  Japan went to IVM.  Japan is COVID-free. It did it in less than a month! So if your government won't do what Japan did, now that JAPAN HAS BEAT COVID, what does it say about your government? It says the conspiracy theorists were right! They were right. It is a damning conviction of the narrative that the government is somehow a benevolent force against you getting viruses. No, because we now have historic precedent of a government doing the right thing and getting the WIN. If your government won't do it, it is because the vax is about something other than the public good. Hmmmm. What could it be about? How about totalitarian control!

,"(Natural News) Nearly a decade prior to the release of Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccines,” the Health Ranger was warning us all about future “self-spreading” injections that threatened to annihilate humanity from the face of the earth.  Self-spreading vaccines, in case you are unfamiliar with them, spread without even having to be injected. The vaccinated simply “shed” them onto others through close contact, infecting the unvaccinated with chemical particulates that could sterilize or kill them.  We are already seeing this happen with Chinese Virus injections, which are causing women to have irregular periods and men erectile dysfunction. In short, Wuhan Flu shots are a death sentence for those who take them, and possibly even those who do not.  Back in 2012 when the Health Ranger was warning about “self-replication pollution,” most people were only thinking about genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and nanotechnology. Today, it is more widely understood that such bioweapons also include vaccines.  As the Health Ranger explained, “self-replicating microscopic machines” were being used even then to advance the depopulation agenda. Also known as self-replication microscopic weapons, such technology serves one purpose: to kill people.  Vaccines are the virus  Last fall, the mainstream media was discussing how self-replicating technology was already being investigated for use in conjunction with Chinese Virus injections.  Recognizing that a majority of Americans would probably reject a vaccine for an alleged virus with symptoms that mirror a mere cold or cough, the medical deep state came up with a plan to quietly vaccinate all of society without having to inject every single person.  Self-replicating vaccines thus became a solution to the problem of vaccine “hesitancy” because they have the capacity to spread vaccines via infection – meaning if you are close to someone who was recently injected, you very well could “catch” the vaccine from them through their saliva or nasal discharge.  This sounds a whole lot like what the medical fascists have been saying about the Chinese Virus itself, except there was never any definitive proof that the virus could be spread that way. Meanwhile, we now have solid proof showing that the injections, and those who receive them, are the vectors spreading disease.  Because injected people are basically walking disease factories, avoiding them at all costs could go a long way in protecting yourself against infection.  One of the scariest things about self-spreading Wuhan Flu shots is the fact that they will never again be contained now that they have been released. Even the medical deep state admits that this is the case, warning that once released, “scientists will no longer be in control of the virus.”  “It could mutate, as viruses naturally do,” warns Filippa Lentzos, writing for The Bulletin. “It may jump species. It will cross borders. There will be unexpected outcomes and unintended consequences. There always are.”  “Self-spreading vaccines are essentially genetically engineered viruses designed to move through populations in the same way as infectious diseases,” Lentzos further reveals.  Since there is not much we can do at this point other than to try to avoid those who have been vaccinated, the next best thing is to build up your immune system in any way you can. Even more importantly, pray for protection for yourself and your family because we are now in completely uncharted territory.  “We are watching a genocidal transgenerational plan unfolding. Bill Gates is executing it on behalf of dead men and others who shared their goals,” warns Vince Morreno. “This is diabolical. Satanic. Civilization in facing a hugely clear and present danger.”  More of the latest news about Chinese Virus mass genocide can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.

4a1a9b9f,"Urgent action to boost the number of children and young people receiving life-saving vaccinations will be set out by the Prime Minister today. Boris Johnson will visit a hospital in the South West and lay out a number of measures designed to improve vaccination rates, including for measles, mumps and rubella MMR. While confidence in the UK’s world-leading vaccination programme remains high – with uptake exceeding 90% for most childhood immunisations – there has been a small but steady decline in coverage in recent years. It means that the UK has lost its ‘measles-free’ status with the World Health Organisation WHO – three years after the virus was eliminated in the country. The WHO have stated that in the first six months of 2019 reported measles cases globally are almost three times as many as the same time last year. Measles is now endemic in countries including France, Germany and Italy. The PM has now called for health leaders to renew their efforts to meet 95% for both doses of MMR. Currently just 87% of children are getting their second dose of the jab, which has likely contributed to the spread of measles. Action to achieve this includes: NHS England writing to GPs urging them to promote ‘catch up’ vaccination programmes for MMR for 10-11 year olds, as well as all those 5-25 year olds who have not had two doses of the jab; Strengthening the role of local immunisation coordinators – healthcare professionals that promote vaccines particularly with hard-to-reach families. This includes supporting areas with low uptake and tailoring specific local interventions to under-vaccinated communities; Addressing parents’ concerns about vaccines by updating the advice on NHS.uk specifically to address misleading information about the dangers of vaccines, by giving people NHS-approved, evidence-based and trusted advice on vaccines including through a new website; Calling a summit of social media companies to discuss how they can play their part in promoting accurate information about vaccination; and The Department for Health and Social Care – working with Public Health England and NHS England – delivering a comprehensive strategy to address the issue in the Autumn. Ahead of the hospital visit Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: After a period of progress where we were once able to declare Britain measles free, we’ve now seen hundreds of cases of measles in the UK this year. One case of this horrible disease is too many, and I am determined to step up our efforts to tackle its spread. This is a global challenge and there’s a number of reasons why people don’t get themselves or their children the vaccines they need, but we need decisive action across our health service and society to make sure communities are properly immunised. From reassuring parents about the safety of vaccines, to making sure people are attending follow-up appointments, we can and must do more to halt the spread of infectious, treatable diseases in modern-day Britain. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: It’s easy to forget how devastating measles can be precisely because vaccines are so effective at preventing it in the first place. With this strategy, the whole health system will come together to renew focus on vaccinations – especially for our children – and this time we will eliminate measles for good. The Prime Minister’s visit to the South West is part of a series of visits to hospitals he is taking. He will meet doctors and nurses, hearing directly from them about what support they think the NHS needs so it can continue to be the best healthcare service in the world. Measles elimination status means that the virus is no longer circulating permanently in a country. The UK achieved measles-free status in 2016 after three years of limited spread due to high vaccination rates, but measles has since been spreading slowly in the UK for over 12 months. In the first quarter of 2019, there were 231 confirmed cases of measles in the UK. Many of these were acquired abroad with some onward spread in under-vaccinated communities. The Department for Health’s strategy to be published in the Autumn is also expected to: Ask the NHS to use technology to identify who may have missed a vaccination and make booking appointments easier, such as improved call/recall systems for those accessing immunisations, and more consistent use of these systems across UK healthcare to remind people of their vaccine appointments. As part of the GP contract review, examine wider questions of improving GP capacity to allow additional immunisation appointments – while also asking NHS England to consider other settings outside of a GP for vaccinations. Develop a major campaign with NHS England and Improvement, Public Health England and GP practices to support the importance of key vaccinations in protecting against potentially dangerous diseases. Work with DFE to explore more ways in which students can be informed about their health and wellbeing including the value of vaccinations – plus enabling them to critically assess misinformation spread online about certain vaccines. This comes as part of a wider government drive on Prevention, following the publication of the Prevention Green Paper last month. Head of Immunisation at Public Health England Dr Mary Ramsay said: Losing our ‘measles-free’ status is a stark reminder of how important it is that every eligible person gets vaccinated. Elimination can only be sustained by maintaining and improving coverage of the MMR vaccine. Measles is one of the most infectious diseases known to man – only one person travelling back to an area with lower vaccination rates can lead to an outbreak. Anyone who has not received two doses of MMR vaccine is always at risk.",Who are the arsonists setting rural fires in Washington State?,false,

A picture taken outside of Cambodia of Sam Rainsy C,L and the seven other former CNRP lawmakers convicted over the coup plot. Facebook Government officials have defended the Phnom Penh Municipal Court’s conviction of former opposition leader Sam Rainsy and eight other senior officials over a plot to topple the government amid criticism over the move. Ministry of Justice spokesman Chin Malin said yesterday that the court’s decision against former opposition leaders was made according to the law, saying the court had enough arguments to prosecute them. “More importantly, the authorities have acted in accordance with legal procedures, and the courts conducted the trial based on procedure and made decisions based on the facts and existing legal aspects,” he said. Presiding Judge Duch Sok Sarin on Monday sentenced Rainsy, who is living in exile, to 25 years in jail, while Mu Sochua and Eng Chhai Eang, both vice-presidents and former lawmakers of the ex-CNRP, were sentenced to 22 years in jail each. The judge also sentenced six other ex-CNRP lawmakers to 20 years in jail each after they were found guilty of attempting to “attack” the government. They are Rainsy’s wife Tioulong Saumura, Ou Chanrith, Ho Vann, Long Ry, Men Thavarin and Nuth Romduol. All of them are living in exile abroad. The convicts were deprived of their right to vote and the right to stand for election. Rainsy vowed to return to the Kingdom to restore democracy and human rights on November 9, 2019, but his planned return failed to materialise. However, the government accused him and his allies of planning a coup. In his statement on the conviction, Rainsy said it was simply a “political statement” born out of weakness and fear. “Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen is afraid of any risk of my returning to the Cambodian political scene. He also dreads the prospect of any free and fair election which would inevitably lead to the end of his current autocratic and anachronistic regime,” he said. Rainsy claimed Mr Hun Sen has repeatedly refused to allow him and other leading figures of the ex-CNRP to return to Cambodia, saying the sentence is simply intended to intimidate ex-CNRP supporters within the country. However, Malin said ex-CNRP leaders have never acknowledged their wrongdoing. “It is normal for them to never admit their mistakes. As a justification, the perpetrator never admits that he has committed a crime,” Malin added. In its statement, the court-dissolved CNRP described the verdict as: “Cambodia’s politicised court confirms the coup and abolition of democracy”. It said it fully denies all charges and resolutely rejects the verdict. It added that 130 members of the ex-CNRP have been kept in pre-trial detention over the past year and charged as accomplices of the nine CNRP leaders. “The international community must respond to these intolerable developments in an equally determined way,” it added. “These sentences have to be denounced, rejected and ultimately withdrawn.” The US Embassy in Phnom Penh yesterday said it was troubled by the sentences handed down against the nine Cambodian political opposition leaders, including some who are also American citizens. “These sentences are part of a series of mass trials against more than 130 political opposition supporters and civil society activists, which lack basic due process,” it said. “We urge the government of Cambodia to protect freedoms of expression and association, as enshrined in the country’s constitution, and call on authorities to take meaningful steps to reopen civic and political space in the lead up to the 2022 Commune Election and the 2023 National Election,” it added. However, Cambodian People’s Party spokesman Sok Eysan said yesterday that the conviction will result in ex-CNRP leaders no longer being able to enter and participate in the 2022 and 2023 Commune and National Elections. He said the political life of the ex-CNRP leaders has come to an end because of their bad intentions against the people and nation. “The case is a legal matter, not a political one.”",Why Scientists DisagreeAbout Global Warming The NIPCC Reporton Scientific Consensus,false,

Work crews showed up and made quick work, rolling the monument out and down the ramp for disabled people.  Pelosi had this to say about the removal:  “It’s long overdue that we make a separation between church and state. Non-Christians should not be forced to read the 10 commandments while walking into their capitol. God doesn’t belong here.”  God doesn’t belong here? Those are fighting words.  More than ever, it’s clear that God is needed in our government. Our lawmakers need to be reminded of who is actually in charge. We should have biblical laws on the books. Husbands should be able to sell their wives to settle debts. Women should be silent. Lethal force should only be permitted after darkness. And, if a woman interferes in a fight between two men by grabbing her husband’s opponent’s privates, her hand should be cut off.  We need to get back to these biblical basics. Removing an ancient monument should be the furthest thing from Pelosi’s agenda.  But, of course, it’s not.  Joe Barron, the representative for the organization, Put God Everywhere says:  “We will fight this every step of the way. The first step was to get in front of the monument as they were rolling it out and try to stop it. Unfortunately, it was just too heavy to stop. We will continue this tug-o-war for months and have no doubt we will be victorious. The monument WILL be placed back in the Capitol when we are finished!”  As God would want it.

26898e5b,"Joe Biden’s Inauguration has been cancelled, President Trump would remain in office and the Chinese Communist Party propaganda media outlets of ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC would soon be off the airwaves according to President Trump.  “I have invoked the Insurrection Act of 1807 Section 10 U.S. Code 13 251-255 to address the treasonous rebellion conducted by Democrat and Republican lawmakers, CCP Agents Chinese Communist Party, FBI, Department of Justice, CIA and others to dismantle the United States of America and it’s Constitution,” President Trump declared on Thursday 14 Jan. “These entities pose a direct threat to national security. I will remain President indefinitely until all domestic enemies are arrested.”  President Trump invoked the Insurrection Act after another assassination attempt on him last Sat. morning 9 Jan. According to his Intel, Chinese Communist Party Agents, the FBI, Department of Justice, CIA and others of the Deep State have – with the help of the Main Stream Media – long been planning to dismantle the US and it’s Constitution.  Of course, none of these treasonous acts have been reported by the corrupt Main Stream Media. Trump had evidence that the MSM was “embedded with CIA and Chinese Communist Party agents whose sole purpose was to direct public opinion toward a Deep State agenda.”  During President Trump’s four years in office he and what has been referred to as the Alliance have been fighting this Cabal – a Satan worshipping force composed of thirteen Satanist Bloodline families out of Italy, the Vatican, UK Monarchy, British M16, Chinese Communist Party, CIA, FBI, Department of Justice, Antifa, Black Lives Matter and certain Republican and Democratic Lawmakers. Another attempt on his life was the last straw.  Since that Sat. 9 Jan. the US has been under an abbreviated Martial Law with President Trump as Commander in Chief and General Flynn in charge of the Military. As such Trump has signed multiple Executive Orders that among other powers, allowed for Military arrests and Tribunals.  Soon to be acted upon were well over 222,286 sealed indictments against political and global elites filed in federal courts across the nation.  https://operationdisclosure.blogspot.com/2021/01/sealed-indictments-as-of-december-31.html#more  By law with the Insurrection Act in effect, Trump would remain President indefinitely until all domestic enemies were arrested. He would soon take down the Main Stream Media.  “I’m drafting an Executive Order to take the following propaganda media outlets off the airwaves: ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC. I am also working with the FCC to pull their licenses. We have evidence that all of these media organizations employ agents of the Chinese Communist Party as well as embedded CIA Agents whose sole purpose is to brainwash, hypnotize and direct public opinion toward certain agendas that support the Left and Deep State. These organizations are a threat to national security and virtually nothing they report is actual news.”  It’s no small task to take down the Cabal. Military and Special Forces units have been deploying all over the US in 400+ cities. Right now there were over 15,000 troops in DC according to Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy. Special Forces units have covertly infiltrated Antifa and Black Lives Matter and made silent covert arrests.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4_DNABtptU  That same Sat. 9 Jan. POTUS and the Department of Defense postponed the 20 Jan. Presidential Inauguration. Intel sources claimed that if Joe Biden was not inaugurated there were corrupt-FBI plans to help stage Antifa and BLM violence in DC and at the 50 state capitols from Sat 16 Jan. through Wed. 20 Jan. Biden couldn’t be inaugurated anyway because of the Insurrection Act that demanded Trump remain in office “until all domestic enemies were arrested.”  A corrupt Mass Media has refused to report anything but their Left Wing agenda believed paid for by the CCP. Thus, the President has announced he would soon activate the Emergency Broadcast System EBS. This was expected during what has been referred to as Ten Days of Darkness, or media outage.  With the EBS everyone would get alerts on their phones, TV, radio and Internet that would override other broadcasts for several hours at a time. The broadcasts would explain the silent war happening across the globe between the Cabal and Alliance.  This week Trump Intel providers Robert David Steele and Juan OSavin explained, “This may not be settled until April 1. Anyone including Fox, who refuses to broadcast the President of the US faces loss of their FCC licenses as well as criminal punitive actions, perhaps a military takeover.”  On Wed. 13 Jan. in an urgent message to the American people President Trump called for peace. Intel sources were reporting that riots were planned in DC and across the nation. He condemned the rioters at the state capitol, as well as a recent assault by Social Media on our Freedom of Speech and then activated military forces to quell unrest.  https://trendingpolitics.com/breaking-president-trump-releases-urgent-video-message-to-the-american-people/  The recent violation of Social Media platforms to censor Freedom of Speech was of concern. Donald Trump Jr. to the rescue. Trump Jr. announced that a new social media platform was coming soon called the Freedom Social Network.  More important, President Trump had officially shut down the Cabal’s USA Inc. and re-started a restored Republic on 4 July 2020.  https://web.archive.org/web/20110720183531/http://reality-bytes.hubpages.com/hub/The-Corporation-Of-The-United-States-Of-America  It was all a part of the Alliance’s Plan to free the globe of the Communist Parties /Cabal’s suppression of The People. “The Plan To Save The World”:  https://rumble.com/vagd07-q-the-plan-to-save-the-world-remastered.html  https://www.bitchute.com/video/qvfUkQTG5QHP/  As part of that plan President Trump’s Space Force has been involved in worldwide blackouts in multiple countries as Alliance Special Force units made arrests. Overnight to Sun. 10 Jan. multiple arrests were conducted, including in Frankfurt Germany – home of the CIA office where Dominion Voting machines illegally changed Trump votes to Biden in the 2020 Election.  Over last weekend French and Russia Alliance military leaders’ Special Force units took out Deep Staters in Italy, Pakistan, Berlin and Paris. By the first of the week they had moved to Iran where they caused Blackouts in order to target global and regional terrorism.

This officially activated Space Force and it’s Quantum Computer that would put us and the world on the Gold Standard, provide a transparent and instantaneous Quantum Voting System for our first Restored Republic Election in March 2021, plus provided the platform for a top secret Global Broadcast Satellite Program that could override all TV screens for President Trump’s worldwide addresses.

1502bd12,"During the Republican National convention, President Trump spent a lot of time covering the dangers and ill-advised policies of a Biden administration. An America under the supervision of the radical Democrat candidate seems, at least to his watchful eye, a disaster in the making with our very lives and freedoms in serious jeopardy.  Just recently, Biden confirmed one of those very fears during a campaign speech at the Joe Barron Jewish community center in Pohtaytoe, Virginia, referring to the sacred and God-blessed second amendment right of all Americans to own and use firearms at any time anywhere for any reason whatsoever as “obsolete.” Clearly, this is either a case of Trump being right on the money, or a satirical article to drive gullible trumpers into blood pressure fits.  Supporters of the President constitute the country’s least educated and most violently gullible of citizens, and do, in fact, believe idiotic things about the amendment that are laughably untrue. Such as that it’s purpose is to fight the government should it become tyrannical. Sure, Jethro, they went through all the work of designing a country and government the likes of which the world had never seen, and then put in a self-destruct button in case you didn’t want to wear a mask, you pussy.  The truth is, there have only been two times the second amendment has been threatened in recent memory. The first was when Trump himself suggested “taking the guns and worrying about the legal stuff later.” The second was when Trump lied and said that Biden was coming after it. To no great shock, Trump’s parade of happy dipshits ignored the first and blew their own balls off about the second.  The history of gun-grabbing is long and storied, and always pushed as a fear tactic by republicans.

d8bc460f,"We’ve reported on numerous events identified in the 2020 election already which are being referred to as ‘glitches’ by the Democrats. Tonight we just uncovered another ‘glitch’ in Wisconsin.  When this one is confirmed it will result in a 19,500 vote gain for Trump making the Wisconsin race a total toss-up.  There is now a pattern of events we have uncovered across the country where votes are being taken from Republicans at all levels and transferred to competing Democrats in offsetting amounts. These are not random because in every case votes are moved from Republicans to Democrats.  This is beginning to appear like a strategy used by the Democrats to steal this election.

Then another example was uncovered in Oakland County Michigan where again a Republican won his race as a result this glitch being reversed.  Then in Pennsylvania a ‘glitch’ was uncovered where nearly 20,000 votes were moved from President Trump to Biden.  When this is confirmed it will result Biden’s lead being cut by 40,000 votes in Pennsylvania bringing this race back to even:  Then we found approximately 6,000 votes which were taken from Trump and moved to Biden in Georgia due to a ‘glitch’:  Now tonight we have identified approximately 10,000 votes that were moved from President Trump to Biden in just one Wisconsin County.  This information came from an individual who saw this happen in Rock County Wisconsin.  On election night the results of the county were presented during the evening and showed that President Trump won Wisconsin in 2016. At 10:59 the votes came in and the race was close with both candidates at around 29,000 ballots. Then by 11:12 President Trump had taken a nearly 1,000 vote lead on Biden with 31,000 votes to Biden’s 30,000:  In  At 11:21 these results had not changed much. Then at 11:43 more votes came in and they showed Trump had taken a commanding lead at 46,649 to Biden’s 37,133. This was a 9,516 vote lead for Trump.  But then suddenly at 11:57 these votes had swapped. Biden was reported with 46,649 and Trump was reduced to Biden’s former total of 37,133. These votes had swapped from the President Trump to Biden – again a swap from a Republican to a Democrat.  The net impact was 19,032 votes.  We checked these numbers again tonight from a different source and the final numbers are still showing Biden ahead of President Trump by the same 9,516 votes.  Currently the race in Wisconsin is showing Biden with a lead of 1,630,570 votes to President Trump’s 1,610,030 votes. When this adjustment is confirmed Biden will only hold a 1,508 vote lead.  This of course is before any of the hundreds of thousands of questionable votes showing up for Biden in Milwaukee early in the morning after the election are validated.

,"The U.S. military has arrested disgraced former FBI Director James Comey on charges of treason, sedition, obstruction of justice, and aiding and abetting persons actively involved in criminal behavior, Real Raw News has learned.  Donald J. Trump greenlit the Tuesday morning raid on Comey’s lavish, suburban home after speaking to Marine Corps Col. John Lynch, commanding officer of the Marine Raider regiment at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Col. Lynch committed at least two 4-man squads to the mission, said a confidential source involved in Trump’s quest to depose Joseph Biden and restore America to the people.  On Tuesday at about 3:00 a.m., U.S. Marines operating on Donald Trump’s authority stormed Comey’s seven-bedroom, 10,700-sqaure-foot mansion in McClean, Virginia. Although most operational details are classified, our source said Raiders surprised Comey, who was half-asleep in bed, and apprehended him after he reached for a pistol underneath a pillow. Before he could palm the weapon, a Marine charged forward and struck Comey’s forehead with the butt of his rifle, rendering Comey unconscious.  “Trump’s people had digital surveillance on the Comey residence for quite a long time. They knew Comey’s wife, Patrice, would be out of town on personal business, and none of the kids would be around visiting. Trump’s been anticipating this moment a long time; it’s a day of reckoning,” our source said.  Trump, our source added, had authored a sealed indictment on Comey shortly after firing him on May 9, 2017. He had obtained irrefutable evidence proving that Comey, an Obama holdover, had been on Clinton’s payroll and, on her authority, tried to slander the president by linking the Trump campaign to Russian interference in the 2016 election. Moreover, Trump had obtained a 2015 audio recording in which Comey told Hillary Clinton he would “do whatever it takes, no matter what” to scuttle Trump’s bid for the presidency. Additionally, Trump learned that Comey’s faux investigation into Clinton’s handling of confidential emails was merely for effect, optics to avoid the appearance of impropriety and bias.  “Comey is criminal scum. He doesn’t have a modicum of decency. Trump also has the goods on him for wiretapping Trump Tower. Comey’s been taken to a secure holding pending transportation to GITMO, where he’ll face a military tribunal. One thing that’ll come out is that when Comey got hold of Anthony Weiner’s laptop, he found videos of Huma Abedin and Hillary Clinton doing some pretty terrible things to kids. Comey kept that info from the public, probably at Clinton’s request,” our source said.  In closing, we asked our source why, with so many arrests dropping, family and friends of the accused haven’t complained to CNN or MSNBC about their loved ones being abducted in the dead of night.  “The only explanation is the Deep State is keeping them silent,” our source said. “If it became officially known that people like Clinton, Podesta, Abedin, and now Comey have been nabbed by the military, it would weaken the Deep State’s hold on society—because it would show they are losing. And the Deep Staters always want to give the appearance of winning.

An FBI insider has leaked the extensive visitor logs to Epstein Isle. Several notable names were mentioned in the log, including Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Nancy Pelosi. But the most frequent visitor was none other than Adam Schiff, who visited 78 times over the span of five years.  Chief Inspector of the Department of Investigation, Joe Barron, gave his thoughts about the case, saying the details were sickening.  “What we have discovered over the past few months has been disturbing, to say the least. This goes to very very highest levels. No one could have predicted this. Only the foil hats would have thought this to be possible. Schiff looks to be the ringleader of the operation, arranging the trades and handled the financing. I can’t say anything else since it’s a nonexistent investigation, but rest assured justice will be served. In America, no one is above the law, except the rich.”  This is truly sickening news, but not unexpected. It was well-known that Schiff and Epstein were in cahoots, but the fact that Epstein was one of the main figures behind the operation was unexpected. This explains the impeachment hoax, since he was looking for a distraction.  These people are in the highest levels of government and need to be found out and prosecuted.  We can’t have this type of behavior in America.",Leaked Visitor Logs Reveal Schiff’s 78 Visits to Epstein Isle,false,
,"It’s no secret that Donald Trump, #45, loves the police and holds them in high regard. Trump is a big fan of all first responders, but none more than police officers. Donald Trump spoke about early aspirations to be a police officer, but his family business came calling louder. That did nothing to diminish his love for law enforcement.  Donald Trump has been following the trial of Derek Chauvin, the police officer who is accused in the death of George Floyd. Trump knows he is innocent, and he sprung to action. It’s been a secret, but it’s now in the open. Donald Trump is funding Chauvin’s legal defense. Every penny of it. Trump has called the accusations against Chauvin a witch hunt, much like the Russian witch hunt he himself dealt with from the liberal democrats. He seems a lot of himself in Derek Chauvin.  Much like Chauvin, Donald Trump is a pretend tough guy, with fans acting as if Chauvin was some kind of super cop, just like they pretend Trump was a super president. Little do the democrats know, Trump likes to bet big on people. Usually the worst people. So he is paying Derek Chauvin’s lawyers. Well, maybe, Trump doesn’t really pay anyone, so there’s sure to be a lawsuit here somewhere.  Presidential historian Joseph Barron says there’s no precedent for this, usually leaders stay out of murder trials, but this is different. Trump being a racist helps Chauvin, so the Minneapolis cop will be benefiting from Donald Trump’s own prejudice. It’s a win win for Trump, as it shows his pretend love for law enforcement and it’s a plus because Chauvin apparently hates the same kind of people Trump does.  It’s no surprise that Chauvin backers are the same mindless lunatics that supported Donald Trump. All of the evidence is there, yet they gloss over it and scream “media bias” and fold their hands over their extended bellies and straighten out their dirty MAGA hats. They’re not going to put up with any kind of common sense or decency. God bless America.",Trump Picking Up Officer Chauvin’s Legal Fees,false,158632444722725395888152815684113872057
2e431d37,"Dr. Richard Bartlett, a Dallas MD who previously advised Governor Rick Perry for 7 years has a lifesaving COVID breakthrough, that Taiwan, Japan, Singapore and Iceland are also using. The breakthrough is an inexpensive generic drug used to help asthmatics for more than 20 years, but the US and most of the world’s governments are using the WHO’s blind acceptance of the failed China strategy.  The deaths in every state, and every country could almost stop overnight if health professionals changed course immediately. For some reason, the NIH and CDC want to act as slow as molasses, but a small number of doctors are already doing this with their patients and they are seeing immediate success.  Will it work for every single patient? That remains to be seen, but many people who have used this protocol saw immediate results. This is the same path taken by Taiwan 24 million people, 7 deaths, Japan 126 million, 977 deaths, Singapore 5.6 million, 26 deaths Iceland 341,000 population, 10 deaths.  The Doctor and His Successes  Dr. Richard Bartlett has been practicing in Texas for 28 years. Gov. Perry asked him to be on the Health Disparities Task Force for two years, and he stayed for seven years. He is a regular CBS-TV health expert. He is also a medical author, who undertakes medical missions around the world.  Dr Bartlett says he is giving his COVID-19 patients an inhaled steroid, a standard asthma treatment. Not only is this treatment working, he says many of his patients see immediate results. For best effect, this generic medicine is administered through a nebulizer machine, not an inhaler.  100% of Dr. Bartlett’s patients are alive, and he has been using it since March, almost four months.  The Virus and The Medicine  COVID is a respiratory inflammatory disease so an effective medicine must address respiratory inflammation.  The medicine used by Dr. Bartlett is administered as part of a trio. First, there is an inhaled asthma medication, a steroid that costs $200 for the complete treatment. It is administered through a nebulizer, and it takes about 5 minutes. In addition, Dr. Bartlett gives an antibiotic to protect from secondary infection of pneumonia, and also zinc, which fights against virus multiplication.  Here is how Dr. Bartlett explains it. “You plug in the machine, put the pre-mixed, pre-measured medicine from the pharmacy into the [machine] reservoir and push the ‘on’ button. You breathe it for 5 minutes.”  “Patients tell me they feel better during the first treatment. Their chest pain goes away. Their shortness of breath goes away. Then their fever breaks.”  This very safe medicine has been used on millions of people, including premature babies and also fragile people in nursing homes, for more than 20 years. It has no cardiac risk.  Why This Works  Dr. Bertlett says “COVID is a respiratory virus that goes into the lungs, and binds with ACE receptors in the lungs. That triggers a cytokine storm inflammatory chemicals and enzymes all over the body.”  COVID kills some people if they are not treated. 50% of people get COVID but they don’t even know. For the 20% at risk, there are treatments that are already valid and working. Unfortunately, there are also failed protocols that are being used and repeated, killing people who did not need to die, had the right approach been taken, as Dr. Bartlett’s work shows.  “There is a lot of research on this medicine already and it is very safe,” Dr. Bartlett says.  The Patients  One of Dr. Bartlett’s patients has 2 types of lymphoma and is on chemotherapy. After being in bed at home with a fever for 5 days, she called him and he started her on the treatment that night. By the morning, her fever broke. She recovered over the weekend and worked a full day on Monday, and has since had two negative COVID tests.  Another of his patients has a 50-year history of smoking, and had quadruple bypass surgery. Even with high blood pressure and thyroid disease, this patient also had a positive result.  Why Repeat The Failed China Strategy?  The failed China strategy is being followed because the World Health Organization is promoting it. Some countries have already realized the failure and changed to the same winning strategy used by Dr. Bartlett.  Although the treatment used by Dr. Bartlett, Singapore, Japan, and Taiwan works, and it is very low cost, the CDC and NIH allow very expensive experimental pharmaceuticals to be used by doctors.  The strategy Dr. Bartlett talks about is “Early Testing. Early Treatment.” This is the same strategy the U.S. uses for cancer, heart disease, stroke and other infections.  That is not the strategy promoted by WHO, which has praised the failed China strategy. Italy followed their strategy and more than 30,000 people died there.  The failed Chinese strategy is “wait until the house is burned 2/3 down and then seek help.” The USA, Australia , the UK and most other countries are currently using the failed China strategy of lockdown and late intervention. The US, at least has massively ramped up its testing regime.  Health Authority Advice  The advice of many health authorities is “Don’t seek help if you have mild-to-moderate symptoms. Wait until you have severe symptoms,” Dr Bartlett says.  Bartlett says some people go to the ER because they feel bad, but they are sent home with a positive test, and are told “Take Tylenol and tough it out at home.”  “That’s a terrible plan for any healthcare problem, especially one that can kill you,” Bartlett says.  Waiting For A Useless Vaccine  Dr. Fauci, the NIH, the CDC and governments around the world are pinning their hopes on a vaccine. That is a strategy doomed to failure because, just like influenza, viruses mutate all the time, and every year, the flu vaccine is changed. This is the reason entities like the Gates Foundation and Big Pharma love vaccines so much. They can make massive amounts of money, because it never ends – it is recurring income.  COVID-19 is just like the ‘flu that kills more than a million people every year. It is an inflammatory respiratory disease and there are already proven safe protocols to keep that kind of medical problem under control.  The fact that the course of action proposed by Dr. Bartlett costs $200 and some of the untested antivirals cost $30,000 plus a hospital stay says a lot about why some people push for a vaccine. People have been conditioned to believe an annual vaccine is the answer to every problem.  Dr. Bartlett’s Paper  In an effort to attract attention to this breakthrough information, Dr. Bartlett has written a paper that cites 51 other articles. The problem is that papers take months to be peer-reviewed and published. In the meantime, people continue to die. Doctors could use this safe protocol now, without waiting, if they knew about it. That’s the reason for this story – one more possibility of getting the information into the hands of people who can make a difference.  Dr. Bartlett isn’t sitting idle, either. He is doing his best to get this information out, but governments work very slowly. They always have and likely always will. While governments around the world dither, people die. Politicians are often protected from information like this, thanks to their staff, who decide what they see. We’re trying to get past those gatekeepers, and would appreciate your help.  This protocol may not work in every case, but the halting of new deaths in Taiwan, Japan, and Singapore shows that it is thousands of times better than what is happening in the U.S. and most other countries today. The key is early action.  To hear the complete interview with Dr. Richard Bartlett by Debbie Georgatos on “America Can We Talk,” watch the video below.

Sign up Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice  Yesterday social media was awash with Father's Day messages and tributes which were everything from funny to emotional and poignant.  Cards and gifts will have been exchanged as dads all over the UK enjoyed family time.  But this isn't the full picture. New research commissioned by Fathers 4 Justice actually goes some way to shattering the Hallmark image of Father's Day .  The ComRes survey showed that out of more than 1000 fathers, 37 per cent said they, or someone they know, have experienced not seeing their children on Father’s Day.  When applied to the general population of the UK, that number equates to 2.3 million dads.  Image: Getty  The focus of the survey was on men with children aged 18 and under.  It showed the sometimes distressing realities of modern-day fatherhood, as one in five fathers, 20 per cent feared losing, or had lost contact with their children, and 22 per cent knew someone who had experienced this.  One third 32 per cent had experienced, or knew someone who had experienced, distress or mental health issues after being denied access to their children.  Image: Getty  Matt O'Connor, the founder of Fathers 4 Justice told the Telegraph: These figures, lay bare the appalling scale and reality of the challenges dads face on a daily basis. Denial of access to their children, estrangement and mental health problems for millions of men has become the norm.  The campaign also seeks to have a dedicated political representative for men and boys, mirroring the role of Women's minister.  Furthermore, the campaign is pushing for a fully funded 'safety net', which would tackle the alarmingly high rates of male suicide, depression and other health issues linked to family breakdown.  Image: PA  The ComRes poll found that nearly one in six dads, 17 per cent had experienced challenges accessing their children, while a quarter 27 per cent knew someone who had.  Since we started our campaign in 2001, our helpline has received in the order of 750,000 calls, roughly one every 15 minutes, from men, or their partners who are struggling with access after separation, depression and mental health problems, or who are being unfairly treated by a system that seems rigged against them, said Mr O’Connor.  These fathers just want to be able to see their kids and not have to go through a lengthy and expensive legal process to make this happen.  CORRECTION: This article's headline originally stated that four in 10 dads have not seen their children on Father's Day.","One in five dads have not seen their kids on Father’s Day, survey finds",false,

,"by Brian Shilhavy  Editor, Health Impact News  There have now been 2,433 fetal deaths recorded in VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) from pregnant women who have been injected with one of the COVID-19 shots. (Source.)  The vast majority of these have been from the Pfizer shot (1,862 deaths) and the Moderna shot (656 deaths.)  There have been more fetal deaths in the past 11 months following COVID-19 shots than there have been for the past 30+ years following ALL vaccines (2,198 – Source.)  Last month (October, 2021) the New England Journal of Medicine admitted that the original study used to justify the CDC and the FDA in recommending the shots to pregnant women was flawed. (Source.)  Since then, researchers in New Zealand have conducted a new study on the original data, and concluded:  A re-analysis of these figures indicates a cumulative incidence of spontaneous abortion ranging from 82% (104/127) to 91% (104/114), 7–8 times higher than the original authors’ results. (Source.)  And yet, the CDC and FDA still continue to recommend the shots for pregnant women, even though a correct analysis on the original data shows that 82% to 91% of pregnant women will suffer miscarriages if their unborn child is less than 20 weeks old. (Source.)  VAERS is a passive system that is severely under reported. The CDC and FDA have never conducted a study to determine what this under-reported factor is, but independent scientists have, and we have previously published the analysis conducted by Dr. Jessica Rose, who has determined that a conservative under-reported factor would be X41. See:  This means that there have probably been at least 99,753 fetal deaths following COVID-19 injections so far.  Here is a video report we made on this last month with some very unfortunate gruesome examples of what these shots are doing to unborn babies.  Related:  UPDATE – November 7, 2021 PM  A couple of hours after publishing this article, a video that has been circulating on the Internet of an interview with a Funeral Director in the UK became known to me.  He has been in practice for over 3 years and is identified as “Wesley,” and was interviewed by a group called “Resistance GB.”  He claims that last fall was one the slowest periods of seeing deaths for all funeral directors, but when the COVID-19 shots were introduced, deaths started dramatically increasing.  It started with the elderly, but then by April they were seeing large numbers of people in their 30s and 40s. Many of them were dying of myocarditis.  Now, they are seeing unprecedented numbers of newborn babies, and they are piling up in hospital refrigerators. Some are full term, some are pre-term, he claims.  The UK originally recommended that pregnant women and nursing mothers should NOT get the experimental COVID shots, but like the CDC in the U.S., they eventually changed their recommendation to encourage pregnant women to get the shots.

6c71d2dd,"The National Basketball Association recently suspended its season. At the time, the reason given seemed justified, given the emergence of COVID-19 and that several players in the league have now tested positive. However, it has been confirmed by anonymous sources that a league shutdown has been in the making for months and that they were simply looking for a good excuse to shut it all down.  The players, led by Washington Generals All-Star Power Forward Art Tubolls, held a secret vote prior to the beginning of the season to suspend the league for any credible reason until President Donald Trump resigns from office or is voted out. Since much of the league is made up of Hollywood actor and musician wannabes, these millionaire crybabies overwhelming voted to approve the measure.  Tubolls said  “Our league is the most popular league in the world and we have a lot of teams in the swing states. We know that we cannot directly pressure the President into resigning but if we can hold his approval rating hostage and make the people scream for his removal, that’s what we’ll do. Worst case is that we get him out in November. We have a plan for the rest of this season if we get our way and we have a schedule set to begin on January 21, 2021 if it comes down to it.”  The liberal elite has been relentlessly attacking our country and our President.  First, LeBron James threatened the sit out unless our National Anthem is no longer being played before games and now this. Even the NHL and Major League Baseball have joined this futile effort.

Why they would pursue this is quite simple – they think of nobody but themselves. Their retirement income is guaranteed through fat congressional pensions in addition to the billions they steal from the taxpayer during their terms in office, so they have no worries.  Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, today launched their latest attack on our beloved social safety net:  “Seniors in this country are soft! They actually rely on this pittance from the government in their latter years! Well guess what, people? This country is in trouble!

,"A military tribunal on Thursday convicted former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, accessory to murder, child trafficking, endangering a minor, treason, and sedition.  The two male, one female panel of officers cast a unanimous verdict shortly after Vice Adm. John G. Hannink, who prosecuted the military’s case against Clinton, showcased his final witness for the prosecution, Clinton’s former strategist and lover, Huma Abedin.  In exchange for leniency and a plea deal, Abedin testified she and Clinton had “shared” underage children with her estranged ex-husband, Anthony Weiner. Pressed to clarify her definition of the word “shared,” Abedin qualified her answer by saying they had “practiced” lewd and lascivious behavior on underprivileged minors Clinton had imported into the United States.  “American children?” Vice Adm. Hannink asked.  “Yes, but not primarily. They’re too easy to track. More often than not from poor countries,” Abedin replied.  “Would you tell this tribunal how you appropriated these children?” Vice Adm. Hannink asked.  “Hillary used her government credentials. She had carte blanche, as a Secretary of State, former Secretary of State and former First Lady. It was easy for her to bring orphaned children in from places like, say, Syria, Afghanistan, or Iraq. No one asked questions. No one to look for them,” Abedin replied callously.  Asked to quantify their exploits, Abedin said she couldn’t count the number of underage boys and girls Clinton had brought to the United States under the pretense of providing them with a fruitful life, but she told the tribunal there had been “many,” most of whom were later “sold or donated” to influential members of the Clinton cabal.  “Who are the people?” Vice Adm. Hannink asked.  “We never knew, exactly. It’s not like Hillary peddled them herself. She had someone handle that, and I don’t know the person’s name,” Abedin replied.  “And yet she still refuses to speak,” Vice Adm. Hannink observed.  He asked the tribunal whether they had heard enough; that the military had presented overwhelming evidence of Clinton’s atrocities against the United States and humankind. Unlike a conventional criminal trial, he reminded the commission, a unanimous verdict was not needed to convict Clinton on any of the charges. A majority vote, he said, would satisfy justice.  The tribunal arrived at a guilty verdict after deliberating only five minutes. They found Clinton guilty on all charges the military had laid out—the murders of Seth Rich, Vince Foster, and Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia; trafficking and abusing minors from Haiti and other third-world nations; conspiring to assassinate a presidential candidate.  As she had throughout the tribunal, Clinton stayed eerily silent as the verdict was read and the officers recommended she receive the death penalty for her crimes. Vice Adm. Hannink asked Clinton if she had preference in how the military carried out her sentence, but still she refused to speak.  “You refused counsel. You refused to defend yourself. This tribunal therefore decides that the defendant, detainee Hillary Rodham Clinton, be hanged by the neck until dead,” Vice Adm. Hannink said flatly. “The sentence will be carried out on April 26, after Taps.”  Huma Abedin will face her own military tribunal, at a date yet to be decided, RRN has learned.

45d1505d,"Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Services Min Aung Hlaing is now in power of the State for the duration of the state of emergency, while Vice President U Myint Swe will now serve temporarily as President. Earlier this morning, State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, President U Win Myint and other National League for Democracy NLD officials across the country were detained by the military, ahead of the first parliamentary sessions scheduled to take place later in the day, according to U Myo Nyunt, spokesperson for the NLD, which won the 2020 elections on November 8. The Tatmadaw said it announced the state of emergency after repeated calls for the government and Union Election Commission UEC to clarify around 10 million voting irregularities went unaddressed, leading to protests and riots across the country. A request to suspend parliament was also ignored. The Tatmadaw said it is acting in accordance with the 2008 Constitution, under which section 417 states that if there is sufficient reason for the disintegration of the Union or national solidarity or that may cause the loss of sovereignty due to acts or attempts to take over the sovereignty of the Union by insurgency, violence and wrongful forcible means, the President may, after co-ordinating with the Natoinal Defence and Security Council, declare a state of emergency. Section 418 of the Constitution further states that the President shall declare the transferring of legislative, executive and judicial powers of the Union to the Commander-in- Chief of the Defence Services to enable him to carry out necessary measures to restore the Union. All legislative functions of parliament will be suspended and dissolved automatically from the day of declaration of the state of emergency. In Myanmar, access to TV channels, phone lines and internet services have been cut. In a statement by White House Spokesperson Jen Psaki said the US is alarmed by the steps taken by the Tatmadaw to undermine the country's democratic transition, including the arrest of State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. US President Joe Biden has been briefed of the situation. The US affirmed its support of Myanmar's democratic institutions, and urged the military to adhere to democratic norms ad the rule of law and to release those detained today.

ecc6b873,"Throughout the election, Donald Trump was battered by CCP Virus statistics in order to hurt the American economy and his political campaign. We know that it was shamelessly wielded as a political weapon to prevent President Trump and his supporters from rallying as Antifa and Black Lives Matter burned progressive poor and minority neighborhoods to the ground throughout the entire year. Now that Biden has been installed into the office of president, he promises to increase Covid lockdown measures and extend them further into your ability to travel and force unscientific mask-wearing for at least 100 days. But, a new peer reviewed study has been released that finds the CDC numbers to be so wildly unsupported as to be pure propaganda that is based on wholly unscientific practices that were needlessly created on-the-spot. The National File Reports “The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC stands accused of violating federal law by inflating Coronavirus fatality numbers, according to stunning information obtained by NATIONAL FILE. CDC illegally inflated the COVID fatality number by at least 1,600 percent as the 2020 presidential election played out, according to a study published by the Public Health Initiative of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge. The study, “COVID-19 Data Collection, Comorbidity & Federal Law: A Historical Retrospective,” was authored by Henry Ealy, Michael McEvoy, Daniel Chong, John Nowicki , Monica Sava, Sandeep Gupta, David White, James Jordan , Daniel Simon, and Paul Anderson.” The study is 25 pages long with over 100 citations. However, the main main points can be summarized. A major point is that testing inaccuracies and unreliability combined with unscientific procedures and methods resulted in demonstrably massive false-positive spikes: “The CDC is now legally requiring red-blooded Americans to wear face masks on all public transportation as globalists try to push the concept of “double-masking” on the populace. Since the election, the World Health Organization admits that PCR tests are not totally reliable on the first try and a second test might be needed. This corresponds with CDC’s quiet admission that it blended viral and antibody test results for its case numbers and that people can test positive on an antibody test if they have antibodies from a family of viruses that cause the common cold. Hospitals in Florida had so many accuracy complications that Orlando Health had to admit that its 9.4 percent positivity rate got recorded at 98 percent. READ: The TRUTH About Fauci and Gates And NIH Owning A Stake in the Vaccine.” There are also profound legal implications raised by the study that need to be dealt with in courts around the country if America is to ever be free again. The data you have been spoonfed by the CDC for a year raises serious legal issues. Much like the 2020 election, massive changes in rules for reporting and collecting data were instituted exclusively for Covid which resulted in a 1600% inflated number of fatalities: “The groundbreaking peer-reviewed research…asserts that the CDC willfully violated multiple federal laws including the Information Quality Act, Paperwork Reduction Act, and Administrative Procedures Act at minimum. Publishing Journal – Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge / Public Health Policy Initiative Most notably, the CDC illegally enacted new rules for data collection and reporting exclusively for COVID-19 that resulted in a 1,600% inflation of current COVID-19 fatality totals,” the watchdog group All Concerned Citizens declared in a statement provided to NATIONAL FILE, referring to the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge study. “The research demonstrates that the CDC failed to apply for mandatory federal oversight and failed to open a mandatory period for public scientific comment in both instances as is required by federal law before enacting new rules for data collection and reporting. The CDC is required to be in full compliance with all federal laws even during emergency situations. The research asserts that CDC willfully compromised the accuracy and integrity of all COVID-19 case and fatality data from the onset of this crisis in order to fraudulently inflate case and fatality data,” stated All Concerned Citizens.” But that is not all. Other major Covid collection and reporting standards created on March 24th of 2020 that inexplicably and intentionally changed decades old practices in order to hide comorbidities and preexisting health conditions on death reports. These underlying health conditions may likely have been the actual or most important cause of death: “On March 24th the CDC published the NVSS COVID-19 Alert No. 2 document instructing medical examiners, coroners and physicians to deemphasize underlying causes of death, also referred to as pre-existing conditions or comorbidities, by recording them in Part II rather than Part I of death certificates as “…the underlying cause of death are expected to result in COVID-19 being the underlying cause of death more often than not.” This was a major rule change for death certificate reporting from the CDC’s 2003 Coroners’ Handbook on Death Registration and Fetal Death Reporting and Physicians’ Handbook on Medical Certification of Death, which have instructed death reporting professionals nationwide to report underlying conditions in Part I for the previous 17 years. This single change resulted in a significant inflation of COVID-19 fatalities by instructing that COVID-19 be listed in Part I of death certificates as a definitive cause of death regardless of confirmatory evidence, rather than listed in Part II as a contributor to death in the presence of pre-existing conditions, as would have been done using the 2003 guidelines. The research draws attention to this key distinction as it has led to a significant inflation in COVID fatality totals. By the researcher’s estimates, COVID-19 recorded fatalities are inflated nationwide by as much as 1600% above what they would be had the CDC used the 2003 handbooks,” stated All Concerned Citizens. And, still, there is MORE! Last spring the CDC created covid-19-exclusive rules that violated federal law by outsourcing data collection rule development and wrote new rules to count probable cases without any definitive proof of infection. The new rules also allowed tracers to practice medicine without a license while disallowing any measures to be put in place to prevent a patient from being counted multiple times: “Then on April 14th, the CDC adopted additional rules exclusive for COVID-19 in violation of federal law by outsourcing data collection rule development to the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists CSTE, a non-profit entity, again without applying for oversight and opening opportunity for public scientific review. On April 5th the CSTE published a position paper Standardized surveillance case definition and national notification for 2019 novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 listing 5 CDC employees as subject matter experts. This key document created new rules for counting probable cases as actual cases without definitive proof of infection section VII.A1 – pages 4 & 5, new rules for contact tracing allowing contact tracers to practice medicine without a license section VII.A3 – page 5, and yet refused to define new rules for ensuring that the same person could not be counted multiple times as a new case section VII.B – page 7,” stated All Concerned Citizens. Why would those in power wish to do such inhumane things to the entire population of America? The National File concludes: “By enacting these new rules exclusively for COVID-19 in violation of federal law, the research alleges that the CDC significantly inflated data that has been used by elected officials and public health officials, in conjunction with unproven projection models from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation IHME, to justify extended closures for schools, places of worship, entertainment, and small businesses leading to unprecedented emotional and economic hardships nationwide. A formal petition has been sent to the Department of Justice as well as all US Attorneys seeking an immediate grand jury investigation into these allegations,” All Concerned Citizens stated.” There is much more to the report, and we suggest that you read it at the link provided in the beginning of this article. All data since last year suggest that Covid-19 hysteria is part of an orchestrated coup against Western values, nations, and laws. At what point will the evidence and data be enough to break the spell cast on millions of Americans by the Covid Cult? Please, bring this report to your local officials and insist that they read it and reverse the policies being implemented and ramped up across the country or America is surely dead.","CDC Exposed: Inflated Covid Deaths By 1600% Throughout The Election, “Violated Multiple Federal Laws” Peer-Reviewed Study Finds...State, Local Governments Must Act",false,

Sadly, our corrupt politicians and mainstream media only relate the bad news.  If you do not have any respiratory symptoms, such as fever, cough, or runny nose, you do not need to wear a medical mask.

Now, as the number of deaths has surpassed 400,000 in the US, Dr. Jensen and lawmakers are calling for an audit of these deaths.  in the US they get $12,000 to $13,000 for patients admitted and testing positive for a COVID-19 diagnoses and another $39,000 again give or take, for those put on ventilators. Those number vary a bit from report to report.  If they have 161 covid patients, they get an extra $70,000 per patient. That one I just found out about via the video. Thank you Dr. Jensen. There should be an audit of deaths world wide, as death certificates were also changed in other countries as well. In the UK for example if you died 28 days after testing positive, you were counted as a covid death.  https://www.bitchute.com/video/kaRWlJ0RpYIN/  Las Vegas Schools Forced To Reopen Amid Rash Of Student Suicides  by Tyler DurdenTuesday, Jan 26, 2021 – 17:45  A surge of student suicides across Las Vegas has pushed the Clark County School District to reopen schools as soon as possible, according to NYTimes.  By December, eighteen students in the district had taken their own lives; an early-warning mental health system embedded within computers and tablets issued to students for remote learning received 3,100 alerts since schools shuttered their doors last March.  “When we started to see the uptick in children taking their lives, we knew it wasn’t just the Covid numbers we need to look at anymore,” said Jesus Jara, the Clark County superintendent.  “We have to find a way to put our hands on our kids, to see them, to look at them. They’ve got to start seeing some movement, some hope,” Jara said.  Efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 across the country have led to drastic changes in the way children and teens learn and socialize.  Government data show a 24% increase in the number of children who arrived in emergency departments with mental health issues from mid-March through mid-October, compared with the same period in 2019.  Countrywide, tens of millions of students have been thrown into a new distance learning environment that has resulted in many extracurricular activities being canceled. Recreational spaces have closed, sports canceled, and playdates shifted to Zoom calls, resulting in many kids developing mental issues, especially in Clark County.  Clark County administrators had GoGuardian Beacon alert system installed on every device given out to students after the sixth student suicide last year. The system alerted administrators of more than 3,100 cases where a student searched suicide-related material between June and October.  In one instance, a 12-year boy searched “how to make a noose” on his iPad.” Administrators quickly reached out to the boy’s parents as he was about to hang himself.  The alerts have been so disturbing to Jara that he doesn’t sleep near his phone anymore.  “I can’t get these alerts anymore,” said Jara. “I have no words to say to these families anymore. I believe in God, but I can’t help but wonder: Am I doing everything possible to open our schools?”  Dr. Anthony Fauci has called for schools on a countrywide basis to reopen safely.  An indirect consequence of the pandemic and forcing children to learn at home has contributed to a rise of mental health issues and suicides among America’s future generation.

a19e0df7,"Here’s something your doctor, or Oncologist will never tell you. If you have cancer, then you have fungus/mold/candida. It feeds the cancer, it is cancer itself. Here’s all you need to know and how to deal with it.  Few things are scarier than hearing the words, “you have cancer.” And yet it’s something that an estimated one third, to half the population will hear at least once in their lifetime.  With such staggering rates and so much money and research poured into combating cancer, you would think we would have rounded the corner towards reducing it, or even found a cure by now. What is terrifying is that despite the millions of dollars spent every year on research, we seem to be no closer to knowing exactly what causes cancer, much less finding a cure for it.  But step away from the mainstream noise for a moment and listen to what many health professionals have understood for some time now. As more and more professors and Doctors are making the link between cancer and something else we all suffer from and that’s fungus. We would even go so far as to say cancer is a fungus. They are one and the same.  These findings are covered over  The Data is building. It’s just not been shouted about loudly enough and the voices of the many professionals that have been shouting this from the roof tops have remained more or less unheard. Whilst research papers have been ignored and down played.  For me, cancer often epitomizes the phrase, “etiology unknown.” As the root causes of cancer are never pinned down and gets ignored. Some factors remain to be seen as contributing, such as Genetics, yet in most cases the traits tend to to be more habitual than genetic. And yet, it’s actually less of a mystery than is made out, as by and large, we can see why some people get cancer and others do not.  We can narrow down the contributing factors to one or more of the following: a compromised immune system, poor diet, poor drinking water, smoking, alcoholism, substance abuse, heavy metal toxicity, asbestos poisoning, radiation, or chemicals…. Yet the main factor throughout all cases of cancer is the presence of infestations of fungus in the body.  In fact, it’s not even a new discovery and dates back to Victorian times, yet the fact remains that fungi and their mycotoxins are not as well understood by mainstream medical science as we hoped by now they would be. It’s just not a popular topic and not enough is openly discussed about this hidden killer.  It is unsurprising that any doctor would roll his eyes at the idea of a link between cancer and fungus. Yet did a little and you will discover there are many published papers throughout medical literature describing the very profound role that fungus plays in the development of cancer. So excuse the pun, but fungus has been left in the dark too long.  Let’s shed some light on fungus  Fungi produces chemical by-products as part of its natural life cycle. These chemicals are often toxic, in which case they are known as “mycotoxins”. These mycotoxins are among the most toxic, naturally occurring chemicals on earth. For example, one mycotoxin known as aflatoxin is a carcinogenic mycotoxin known to cause liver cancer. Other mycotoxins are known to be genotoxic and mutagenic and it’s well published that certain mycotoxins cause cancer.  It’s in our food  What people do not realize is that these mycotoxins are known to contaminate parts of our food supply, particularly grain and corn thus must be avoided. Knowing the huge scope those foods play in the global diet and the frequency with which most people consume those foods, the chances are that most people are regularly consuming mycotoxins. Especially the standard American diet of fast and processed foods.  Furthermore, it is published that certain fungi can actually mimic types of cancer in the body!  Certain fungal species produce a sac, or ascomycete, that on close inspection looks just like cancer cells. Just last year in a European medical journal, doctors found conclusive evidence that a breast cancer tumor was actually a sac fungus.  “The likelihood,” they stated,” that the tumor was not fungal in origin, is low.”  Breast cancer is fungus  And this is also what our team found, whilst undertaking a 2 year study in autopsy and that is that ALL breast cancers, when placed under a dark field microscope, are in fact identified as fungus, not cancer, this is where our research really did begin.  So what does this say to you? Surely this should concern us all.  As a cancer patient, you may have received a lot of information about your treatment and your journey to recovery. That Chemotherapy and radiation cause many changes in the body as they destroy the cancer cells.  And of course, one of these major changes is to your immune system. Just as you need it the most. Your now weakened immune system increases your chances of getting an infection, including, of course, any fungal infections. As we have just stated, everyone without exception with cancer has fungus, this is more than just a coincidence.  Some statistics  The numbers are staggering. Some eight million people die every year from cancer worldwide, with more than half a million in the United States alone. The global number is predicted to rise to twelve million by 2030.    Cancer is the biggest cause of death for people under 85 and in the US one in four people die from cancer – one in four. In the UK the government stated that one in every two people alive today will have cancer at some point. These figures are on the increase not decline.  And then when you look at the rise in Fungus levels, in pollution, with poor quality water, phosphate fertilizers in our food, as well as many other environmental issues. It’s no surprise the rate of cancer is set to increase, not decrease.  Sugar fuels fungus  Sugars and wheat products are a great source of fuel to any fungus. Imagine, one grain of sugar gives enough fuel for that fungus to grow quickly and establish itself.  Most people suffer from fungus in their toes and toe nails, an area of the body that can can be seen by the naked eye, but fungus can live in every living cell of your body including your skin cells. Symptoms of rash etc often are not shown until the fungus is out of control.  In August 9th, 1969 a man named Dr Richard Day, who was at the time head of the Rockerfeller controlled eugenics organization Planned Parenting, addressed a meeting of doctors in Pittsburgh about the approach of of globalisation and how this would change our lives forever. He asked the attending doctors to turn off their recording equipment, to not take notes on what he was about to say. Before he went on to detail a long list of planned changes. One doctor did take notes, however and later talked publicly about what was said.    Now, 40 years later, we can actually see how extraordinarily accurate Dr Day was, as he said: “We can cure almost every cancer RIGHT NOW. Information is on file in the Rockefeller Institute, if it’s ever decided that it should be released.” Yet, letting people die of cancer would “slow down population growth.” And that “You may as well die of cancer, as something else.”    Curing cancer is bad for business  Big Pharma has no desire to cure cancer when it is making vast fortunes from treating the symptoms with devastating drugs and cell-killing, people-killing poisons like chemotherapy. And it is not even primarily about money. It’s about population overgrowth and control. He who holds the purse strings owns the power.  Doctor Simoncini and Candida  An Italian doctor Tullio Simoncini, is a brilliant and courageous man who has refused to bow to such enormous pressure. He personally has faced and continues to face an unimaginable amount of amount of stress after he realized what cancer really is and how it can be dealt with.    Simoncini’s ‘crime’ has been to discover that cancer is actually a fungus caused by Candida, a yeast-like organism that lives in the body in small amounts, even in healthy people. The immune system normally keeps it under control, but when the Candida morphs into a powerful fungus some serious health problems can follow, often in the form of cancer.      In fact Simoncini says that cancer is Candida fungal infection and that the conventional medical explanation of cancer as a cellular malfunction is plain wrong.. And we at Healing Oracle have to agree.  Candida  From the time he entered medicine he realized that something was seriously wrong with the way cancer was treated:  “I saw terrible sufferings. I was in a paediatric oncological ward – all the children died. I was suffering when I was looking at the poor, poor children dying with chemo, with radiation.”  And It was this that led him to search for new ways to understand and treat this devastating disease.  Simoncini realized that all cancers acted the same way, no matter where they were in the body, or even what form they took. He searched for a common denominator. He also observed that the cancer ‘lumps’ were always white. Simoncini realized thatacted the same way, no matter where they were in the body, or even what form they took. He searched for a common denominator. He also observed that the cancer ‘lumps’ were always white.  Cancer cells are white  I was fortunate enough to take a 2 year study in autopsy, where it was confirmed, without any doubt at all, that ALL patients that died with cancer had fungus in more than one part of the body. What else is white? Candida.    So what if Mainstream medicine believes cancer to be simply cell growth going wild, or “cancerous growth,” actually the immune system producing cells to defend the body from Candida attack and the sequence goes like this:  In a healthy body, Candida is kept under control by the immune system, but when that becomes undermined and weakened, so the Candida can expand and build a “colony.” This colony, eventually penetrates an organ and the immune system has to respond to the threat in another way. It builds a defensive barrier of cells around the colony and this growth becomes a lump in the body and becomes identified as “cancer”. The spread of this cancer is then triggered by the Candida fungus, escaping. Often due to a biopsy, or surgery, where the protective barrier of cells is pierced open and the candida is set free to spread elsewhere in the body.      The immune system  So if it’s the immune system that contains the Candida, so it seems as there has been a calculated war on this very system. A silent war that has gained strength over time and become more vociferous with every decade.  The immune system is weakened and attacked by food and drink additives, chemical farming, vaccinations , frequencies, pharmaceutical drugs, the stress of modern ‘life’ and so much more.  Cure Candida with Ozone  Ozone is the number one cure for fungus moulds and pathogens. Ordinary Oxygen molecules consist of only two atoms. The third atom in Ozone only stays attached until it can react with, or oxidize, another substance. If that substance is a bacteria cell or fungi, it’s doomed; the spare oxygen atoms in the ambient ozone attach to the cell walls of microorganisms and crack them open.  Ozone machines  Ozone is a naturally occurring gas created from oxygen atoms. Ozone-disinfecting systems have become popular for people wishing to clean fruit and vegetables, for keeping rooms and hot tubs clean and have been around for several years.  Oxygen is harvested from the air filtering out nitrogen and moisture to get pure oxygen, which is then passed through Corona discharge cells, which deliver a jolt of electricity that turns the O2 into O3. The process leaves oxygen and nitrogen, which is environmentally safe.  The oxygen molecule is made up of 2 oxygen atoms. These oxygen molecules are broken into atoms by the ‘corona discharge’ during lightning storms, or by UV light from the Sun. Single oxygen atoms cannot exist alone without regrouping back into di-atomic  oxygen molecules. During this recombination stage some atoms will regroup into loosely bonded tri-atomic oxygen. This new molecule is called Ozone, as seen to the right d = 1.28 A, Theta = 116.5o. Due to the loose bond in this oxygen molecule – ozone is a very strong oxidant and an ideal chemical-free purification and a disinfecting agent.  Ozone is frequently misdiagnosed and equated to low-altitude pollution. Nothing could be farther from the truth. In fact, Ozone breaks down pollutants and should be welcomed when found in the air. The most effective way to produce Ozone commercially is through the use of pulse injected corona discharge. Disinfection by tri-atomic oxygen Ozone occurs through the rupture of the cell wall. An ozone level of 0.  4 ppm for 4 minutes has been shown to kill any bacteria, virus, mould and fungus.  Ozonated Water  Use Ozone to disinfect both water and the bottles you drink from. Drink 4oz of Ozonated water daily.  Ozone IV  Ozone can be administered via I.V to a patient 3 times a week and up-to 90ml for 2 weeks to ensure all fungus is gone.  For feet candida we suggest Hyperbaric Ozone boots.      Disclaimer  This is a very delicate procedure and should never be attempted at home. Always consult with a fully trained medical professional who fully understands all aspects of Ozone therapy and the risks involved if it is not administered, or monitored correctly.  So if cancer is fungus, is there a common, natural way to kill it and stop it spreading? Well the answer is actually in most people’s kitchen cupboard.  SODIUM BICARBONATE Yes, the main ingredient in good old Baking Soda whilst of course baking soda, contains other ingredients, it’s the Sodium Bicarbonate itself that provides the solution. In fact, it’s such a powerful weapon against fungus, unlike any synthesised drugs, the Candida simply cannot ‘adapt’ to it.  How it works  The patient is given Sodium bicarbonate orally and internally via an endoscope a long thin camera tube, used to see inside the body which allows the Sodium bicarbonate to be placed directly on the cancer fungus itself. Preventing any growth and killing the candida infestation.  Dr Simocini’s many successes have been down played and no clinical trials conducted. It’s a relatively simple and cheap solution and yet all this time millions of people are dying from cancers that could have been treated easily and effectively.  Understanding Salvestrols  In April 2017, two British scientists and researchers, Professor Gerry Potter of the Cancer Drug Discovery Group and Professor Dan Burke published a newsletter. Their combined findings reveal the following:  Cancer cells have a unique ‘biomarker’ that normal cells do not, an enzyme called CYP1B1 pronounced sip-one-bee-one. Enzymes are proteins that ‘catalyze’ increase the rate of chemical reactions.    Organic Fruit and veg  The CYP1B1 alters the chemical structure of something called Salvestrols that are found naturally in many fruit and vegetables. This chemical change turns the salvestrols into an agent that kills cancer cells, but does not harm healthy cells.  The synchronicity is perfect. The CYP1B1 enzyme appears only in cancer cells and it reacts with salvestrols in fruit and vegetables to create a chemical substance that kills only cancer cells.  Salvestrols is the natural defence system found in fruit and vegetables and especially those that are subject to fungus damage. And alarmingly, the chemical fungicide sprays used in modern farming, only artificially kills fungus, which means the plants and crops do not have to trigger their own defence mechanism salvestrols. And so this is why only organic and non GMO foods contain the Salevestrols your body needs to fight cancer.  In fact, the most widely-used fungicides are such powerful blockers of CYP1B1 that if you eat enough chemically-produced food it wouldn’t matter how many salvestrols you then consumed, they are no longer effective as the cancer-destroying agent they are designed to be.  More on the effects of fungus  The biggest cause of fungus is on our feet. We bathe or shower and forget about our feet, that serve us so well. It is important to lift each foot to wash and thoroughly dry them. Wearing open toe shoes as much as possible to allow your feet to breath.  Sneakers should only be worn for training, not for everyday purpose. Sprinkling bicarbonate of soda on your feel after drying is very helpful. Dead skin builds up on the feet, becoming bacteria and fungus.  Removing all dead skin from feet is extremely important.Expose feet as much as possible. Make friends with your feet, become well antiquated and give them some love.  We suggest Ozonation of feet in bad cases for a speedy recovery.  Fungus infections can vary significantly Some fungal infections are mild skin rashes, but others can be deadly, like fungal pneumonia. Because of this, it’s important to eradicate any fungus as soon as possible to try to avoid serious infection.  Fungal infections can look like bacterial or viral nfections. Which is a very common mistake and the resulting antibiotics are ineffective and can lead to gut flora issues later down the line.  The type of cancer you have can affect your risk. If you have a blood cancer like leukemia or myeloma, you may be at an even greater risk of further fungal infection than people with other types of cancer.  Your risk of infection can change based on the strength of your chemotherapy. Aggressive chemotherapy completely depletes your immune system and can put you at risk of getting a fungal infection that will fuel the cancer.  Your hospital stay matters. The longer you are in hospital the greater the risk of fungal infection due the hospitals heating system running at temperatures perfect for breading fungus, bacteria and infection.  Where you live geography matters. Some disease-causing fungi are more common in certain parts of the world. If you live in, or visit these areas and have cancer you may be more likely to get these infections than the general population. Humidity also promote fungus and bacteria.  Preventing fungal infections in cancer patients. Fungi are difficult but not impossible to avoid because they are a natural part of the environment. It lives outdoors, in soil, on plants, trees and other vegetation. They are also on many indoor surfaces and on your skin. However, there may be some ways for you to lower the chances of getting an infection, including a serious fungal infection.  Know if your white blood cell count is low. Having a very low white blood cell count can put you at greater risk of infection and fungus.  Protect yourself from the environment. As you start to recover from the effects of As you start to recover from the effects of chemotherapy and start doing your normal activities again, there are some ways to lower the chances of getting a serious fungal infection by trying to avoid disease-causing fungi in the environment:  Try to avoid areas with a lot of dust like construction, or excavation sites.  Stay inside during dust storms.  Stay away from areas with bird and bat droppings. This includes places like chicken coops and caves.  Wear gloves when handling materials such as soil, moss, or manure.  Wear long pants, and a long-sleeved shirt when doing outdoor activities such as gardening, yard work, or visiting wooded areas and completely wash and dry your feet after walks.  Using 1 cup of apple cider vinegar or half a cup of bicarbonate of soda in a bath tub, or bucket for feet will stop fungus growing.  dehumidifiers in the home will take help take out moisture in the room.  Vacuum AC units every 2 weeks and lightly spray air conditioner filters with apple cider vinegar solution, 1 cup to 1 ltr of water  Don’t forget to do the same with your vehicle.    Cancer-Fungus and the Connection  Another link between fungi and cancer is their relationship with sugar and Gluten. Healthy cells in our bodies use glucose and oxygen to produce ATP adenosine triphosphate, which is the main source of energy for cell functions. Cancer cells, on the other hand, use fermentation to produce ATP. Fermentation does not use oxygen and is, in general, a very inefficient way to produce energy. Cancer cells must consume large amounts of sugar in order to survive and grow.  Cancer cells love fungus and fungus thrives on sugar and gluten. What is the first thing you do when candida gets out of control? That’s right ? lay off the sugar and simple carbs like bread and pasta.  In addition, growing fungi produce chemicals called mycotoxins, which have played some part in the development of cancer in humans according to experimental data. The connection between mycotoxins and cancer lies in its ability to effect the protein production within cells. For example, it can effect protein 53, a protein that, when healthy, can activate other proteins that repair DNA.  According to Dr. Lynn Jennings, family practitioner and medical writer: “A defective p53 protein could allow abnormal cells to proliferate, resulting in cancer. As many as 50% of all human tumors contain p53 mutations.”  If Cancer is a Fungus, Lets Treat it Like a Fungus  Dr. A.V. Constantini, retired head of the World Health Organization’s center for mycotoxins in food, believes that an anti-fungal cancer medication may be just over the horizon. Over the last decades, there has been some anecdotal evidence to support this prediction.  Dr. Simoncini, on the other hand is more doubtful because of the basic nature of fungi itself. “They are social elements,” he says. “They network and they will adapt.”  Dr. Simoncini’s solution to heal cancer naturally is simple. It adheres to the basic principles of natural cancer therapies and to my 7 Essentials ™ System, an evidence-based approach to support and heal the body naturally: change the internal environment in the body from one of acidity which cancer cells love to alkalinity.  Dr. Simoncini recommends the use of sodium bicarbonate therapy. Because the most effective way to shrink tumors is through direct contact with the sodium bicarbonate, in most cases a catheter is used to go through the arteries to the organs within the body.  For some cancers, including breast cancer, a simple local infiltration or injection can be used instead. Dr. Simoncini himself claims that this method carries a 99% success rate for healing breast cancer without surgery.  One can also enjoy an alkaline Sodium bicarbinate drink every day. In a glass of purified water, add the juice of ½ lemon and 1 teaspoon sodium bicarbonate. Stir and enjoy. Because this is such an alkaline drink, always consume it 30 minutes before and at least two hours after a meal as proper digestion requires an acidic pH in the stomach.  In order to prevent breast cancer naturally, be aware of the signs and follow a healthy anti-cancer regime that includes the anti-fungus diet, herbal supplementation, detoxing, emotional healing, biological dentistry, energy balancing and early detection. Maintaining the proper alkaline balance in your body is key to keeping fungal growth ? and breast cancer ? at bay.  There has yet to be discovered any antibiotic that is truly effective in the virus arena. There are indications that DNA viruses such as Herpes are  implicated in human cancers, since they organize the genetic material of the host cell to produce new viruses. Ozone will inactivate viruses on contact, even at very low residual concentrations. In case of polio, only 0.012 ppm removes all viral cells in less than 10 seconds.  Mold, fungus and mildew are easily controlled by Ozone presenting air and in water. Giardia and Cryptosporidium cysts are susceptible to Ozone but not affected by normal levels of Chlorine. The Effects of Ozone on Pathogens The antipathogenic effects of ozone have been substantiated for several decades.  Its killing action upon bacteria, viruses, fungi, and in many species of protozoa, serve as the basis for its increasing use in disinfecting municipal water supplies in cities worldwide.  Bacteria are microscopically small single-cell creatures having a primitive structure. They take up foodstuffs and release metabolic products, and multiply by division. The bacteria body is sealed by a relatively solid cell membrane. Their vital processes are controlled by a complex enzymatic system.  Ozone interferes with the metabolism of bacterium cells, most likely through inhibiting and blocking the operation of the enzymatic control system. A sufficient amount of ozone breaks through the cell membrane, and this leads to the destruction of the bacteria. Viruses are small, independent particles, built of crystals and macromolecules. Unlike bacteria, they multiply only within the host cell. Ozone destroys viruses by diffusing through the protein coat into the nucleic acid core, resulting in damage of the viral RNA.  At higher concentrations, ozone destroys the capsid or exterior protein shell by oxidation. Indicator bacteria in effluents, namely coliformas and  pathogens such as Salmonella, show marked sensitivity to ozone inactivation. Other bacterial organisms susceptible to ozone’s disinfecting properties include:  Streptococci, Shigella, legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aerunginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Mycobacteria, Kelbsiella, pneumonia, and Escherichia coli. Ozone destroys both aerobic and importantly, anaerobic bacteria which are mostly responsible for the devastating sequel of complicated infections, as exemplified by decubitus ulcers and gangrene. The mechanisms of ozone bacterial destruction need to be further elucidated.  It is known that the cell enveloped of bacteria are made of polysaccharides and proteins and that in Gram negative organisms, fatty acid alkyl chains and helical lipoproteins are present. In acid-fast bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, on third to one half of the capsule is formed of complex lipids esterified mycolic acid, in addition to normal fatty acids, and glycolipids sulfolipids, lipopolysaccharides, mycosides, trehalose mycolates. The high lipid content of the cell walls of these ubiquitous bacteria may explain their sensitivity, and eventual demise, subsequent to ozone exposure. Ozone may also penetrate the cellular envelope, directly affecting cytoplasmic integrity, disrupting any one of numerous levels of its metabolic complexities.  Numerous families of viruses including poliovirus I and 2, human rotavruses, Norwalk virus, Parvoviruses, and Hepatitis A, B and non-A non-B?, among many others, are susceptible to the virucidal actions of ozone. Most research efforts on ozone’s virucidal effects have centered upon ozone’s propensity to break apart lipid molecules at sites of multiple bond configuration. Indeed, once the lipid envelope of the virus is fragmented, its DNA or RNA core cannot survive.  Non-enveloped viruses Adenoviridae, Picornaviridae, namely poliovirus, Coxsachie, Echovirus, Rhinovirus, Hepatitis A and E, and Reoviridae Rotavirus, have also begun to be studied. Viruses that do not have an envelope are called “naked viruses.” They are constituted of a nucleic acid core made of DNA or RNA and a nucleic acid coat, or capsid, made of protein. Ozone, however, aside from its well-recognized action upon unsaturated lipids, can also interact with certain proteins and their constituents, namely amino acids. Indeed, when ozone comes in contact with capsid proteins, protein hydroxides and protein hydroxides and protein hydroperoxides are formed. Viruses have no protections against oxidative stress. Normal mammalian cells, on the other hand possess complex systems of enzymes i.e., superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, which tend to ward off the nefarious effects of free radical species and oxidative challenge. It may thus be possible to treat infected tissues with ozone, respecting the homeostasis derived from their natural defences, while neutralizing offending and attacking pathogen devoid of similar defences.  The enveloped viruses are usually more sensitive to physico-chemical challenges than are naked virions. Although ozone’s effects upon unsaturated lipids is one of its best documented iochemical action, ozone is known to interact with proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. This becomes especially relevant when ozone inactivation of non-enveloped virions is considered.  Fungi families inhibited and destroyed by exposure to ozone include Candida, Aspergilus, Histoplasma, Actinomycoses, and Cryptococcus. The walls of fungi are multilayered and re composed of approximately 80% carbohydrates and 10% of proteins and glycoproteins. The presence of many disulfide bonds had been noted, making this a possible site for oxidative inactivation by ozone. In all likelihood, however, ozone has the capacity to diffuse through the fungal wall into the organismic cytoplasm, thus disrupting cellular organelles. Protozoan organisms disrupted by ozone include Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and free-living amoebas, namely Acanthamoeba, Hartmonella, and Negleria. The anit-protozoal action has yet to be elucidated.

Some of the most common causes of this type of infection are dirt, pollution, accumulated sweat as a result of wearing very tight socks and shoes for a longer period of time and walking in dirty water during rainy season. Not washing and ignoring them can lead to harmful consequences.  Here are 7 home remedies you can try to treat toenail fungus.  Tea tree oil contains antifungal and antiseptic abilities, which is very effective in fighting against toenail fungus. Apply few drop of the tea tree oil directly onto the affected nail with a cotton swab. Repeat this twice daily.  Both apple cider vinegar and white vinegar are considered as powerful home remedies to get rid of fungal infections because of its acidic properties.  Soak the infected nail in one part vinegar and two parts warm water for up to 20 minutes everyday. After that, rinse off with water.  Like tea tree oil, garlic, which is a staple in most kitchens, too has antifungal and antimicrobial properties. You can treat toenail fungus by placing crushed garlic cloves on the affected area for half an hour.  Then after it becomes dry, rinse off with water.  Real Organic Honey helps kill fungus and bacteria by flushing out toxins from the body as it contains hydrogen peroxide. Take a tablespoon of honey and apply it on the toenail. Keep for half an hour and then wash off with water. Repeat this twice on a daily basis.  You can use baking soda not only to treat nail fungus, but also to eliminate foot odour. You need to prepare a mixture for this:  Take a bowl and pour 4 cups of hot water, half cup of baking soda, one-fourth cup of hydrogen peroxide and half cup of Epsom salt.  Mix these ingredients properly and add one-fourth cup of white vinegar. Soak the infected nail",CANCER IS CANDIDA/FUNGUS AND CAN BE CURED,false,

Such measures are more than necessary now, as distracted driving has claimed more lives than impaired driving in provinces like British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador. “Mobile phones, even when held by a passenger, can be a dangerous distraction for the driver. Starting next week being distracted by a screen held by a passenger attracts a penalty of $1,500 and three demerit points. “Drivers and screens do not mix – it doesn’t matter who is holding the device. Using FaceTime, taking selfies with the driver or showing the driver a funny cat video is a no-no.” In most provinces a mobile phone is categorised as a “visual display unit”, meaning it is considered akin to a television screen. It’s important to practice safe driving for your own sake and that of your fellow drivers. Canada is cracking down on its distracted driving problem with the rollout of stricter laws that impose harsher penalties and heftier fines on guilty offenders.

If you're a first time buyer, our Help to Buy: ISA could really help you get your foot on the property ladder. It's designed to take advantage of the Help to Buy Scheme, to boost your savings towards a deposit by 25% for your first home, Halifax's Help to buy ISA page reads. It sounds fantastic, offering people struggling to raise a deposit up to £3,000 extra towards the purchase of their own home. There's just one problem – it doesn't actually increase the deposit you pay the seller when you buy a home. Why they just don't work like we were told Image: Getty The devil is in the detail – in this case a clause in the deal, aimed at stopping people getting government cash without bothering to buy a home. The problem is that it also means that the money you have been promised can't be accessed until AFTER you buy. Consumers have been putting money aside on the basis that they believed it would be applied to their deposit on a new home; to now clarify that it is not actually available until completion is the perfect example of a painful lack of transparency and frankly nothing short of deception, said Mark Hayward, managing director, National Association of Estate Agents. Effectively, this means the 500,000 people who've taken out the savings products will get no help to buy at all until the house purchase is completed - and will have to cover the entire deposit passed on to the seller when contracts are exchanged themselves. First-time buyers are already struggling with getting on to the housing ladder and this much hyped initiative was welcomed at the time as a way of helping them, but in fact could have ended up costing buyers if they have gone ahead with a purchase believing that the bonus counted towards the deposit,” Hayward added. In the wake of the revelations – first printed in the Daily Telegraph - the government heavily updated its help to buy page. “When you buy your first home, your solicitor or conveyancer will apply for your government bonus. Once they receive the government bonus, it will be added to the money you are putting towards your first home,” the page read in April this year . The same section now reads: “When you are close to buying your first home, you will need to instruct your solicitor or conveyancer to apply for your government bonus. Once they receive the government bonus, it will be added to the money you are putting towards your first home. The bonus must be included with the funds consolidated at the completion of the property transaction. The bonus cannot be used for the deposit due at the exchange of contracts, to pay for solicitor’s, estate agent’s fees or any other indirect costs associated with buying a home.” poll loading Should help to buy ISAs be re-named? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO Is it good for anything then? The silver lining for people who've taken out one of these products to help them buy a home is that you do, still, get the cash and it can be used to lighten the load of your mortgage repayments. That's because while useless in increasing the size of your deposit, the money can be accessed once the property has been bought and used lower your mortgage balance. That means they CAN count to the deposit as far as the mortgage lender is concerned, just not as far as the seller is concerned. The Mirror has also spoken to people who found the offer of the bonus incentivised them to save more regularly than they had been before thanks to the promise of a 25% boost.

This is a virus that, without adequate restrictions in place, spreads with ferocity. Case rates are increasing again, hospital admissions are climbing again. R is edging up again. “Last week the England wide rate was 159 per 100,000. Now its 188 per 100,000. That’s a 20 per cent increase. Across London cases have increased 30 per cent in a week, the East of England 36 per cent. “None of us are surprised at the action he is taking today. Indeed he was warned that Tier 2 wouldn’t be enough to contain the spread of this virus. Now it looks like in some areas, such as Kent, Tier 3 isn’t enough to contain the spread either. “Elsewhere in the country Tier 3 areas appears to be broadly flat lining, with some like North West trending down. But overall the increasing areas are rising faster than the decreasing areas are falling. “As things stand, we are heading into the Christmas easing with diminishing headroom. The buffer zone these tiers were supposed to provide is getting much thinner. “So what is his plan to keep people safe through Christmas and to avoid huge pressures in the NHS in January? What is his plan to support an exhausted, understaffed NHS through January to deliver the care patients will need? And is he confident that our NHS won’t be so overwhelmed in January that it impacts the vaccination programme? “Our response to Covid-19 could have been stronger had Serco’s contact tracing not left a gaping hole in our defences. In boroughs like Islington only 65 per cent of contacts were traced by the national system. In Tower Hamlets only 60 per cent; In Barking 61 per cent. “Test and Trace is costing £22 billion – more than the policing and fire service combined – and yet according to the NAO, up to September only £785 million was allocated to local council public health teams. “Serco have subcontracted to 21 other firms offering little training to staff, with some in call centres alongside others making sales calls for gambling websites.

On Lateral Flow Tests some care home providers refused to use them due to concerns about their accuracy, is he satisfied these tests are accurate enough for this purpose and are safe? And if they can’t be used for care homes how quickly can care home residents’ relatives makes use of PCR tests? “He often praises Liverpool. But isn’t the biggest lesson to draw from Liverpool that people still struggle to isolate if they haven’t got the financial means to do so? “The eligibility criteria for the £500 payment is too tightly drawn.

Correction Notice: This article previously stated that Kamala Harris said she believes Biden’s “rape accusers.” Following a fact-check from LeadStories as well as a correction in The Federalist, there is a distinction drawn between accusations of “sexual assault” and “rape” compared to accusations of “unwanted touching.” We have issued a correction notice to clarify this issue and we regret this mistake.  According to The Hill as well as The Federalist and several other outlets, Kamala Harris said last year that she believes the women who accused Biden of unwanted touching that made them feel uncomfortable.  “I believe them and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it,” Harris said in 2019.  Several women have accused Biden of unwanted touching, which includes Amy Lappos, Caitlyn Caruso, D. J. Hill, and former Democratic state lawmaker Lucy Flores.  Flores wrote a story in “The Cut” about how Biden put his hands on her shoulders, smelled her hair from behind, and “proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head.”  Harris has been criticized as a hypocrite for supporting Biden over Reade, given her past criticisms of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.  From The Hill:  The California senator added that Biden will need to decide for himself whether to run for president. “He’s going to have to make that decision for himself. I wouldn’t tell him what to do,” Harris said. In recent days, several women have come forward to allege that Biden has touched them inappropriately. Former Nevada state lawmaker Lucy Flores, a Democrat, made the first accusation last week in an essay in New York magazine’s The Cut. On Monday, Amy Lappos told the Hartford Courant that Biden also touched her inappropriately at a 2009 fundraiser in Connecticut. Two additional women, Caitlyn Caruso and D. J. Hill, came forward Tuesday, sharing their experiences with The New York Times. — Advertisement — Biden, who is considering running for president and has led a number of polls of Democrats, has not commented publicly on the accusations since Sunday, when in response to Flores’s allegation he said in a statement that he has “offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort.” “And not once — never — did I believe I acted inappropriately,” Biden added. “If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully.”  Lappos alleged that Biden “put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me…I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth.”  Caruso added that Biden put his hand on her thigh and hugged her “just a bit too long.”  The Hill reported that Biden moved his hand down Caruso’s back during a photo op.

,"Dr. Anthony Fauci sat down with “Meta” CEO Mark Zuckerberg and finally said out loud what many people have been warning for over a year about the rushed mRNA vaccines: They may actually make the Covid pandemic worse.        Dr. Fauci was commenting on a recent study that showed that the Covid vaccines may actually make a recipient more likely to be reinfected than someone with natural immunity from a prior infection.  “This would not be the first time, if it happened, that a vaccine that looked good in initial safety actually made people worse,” Fauci said. “There was the history of the Respiratory Syncitial Virus vaccine in children, which paradoxically made the children worse.”  Pause and read that again. Now consider all of the announcements made by “public health experts” that promised the “vaccines” were “100% safe and effective,” even for children who are at nearly zero risk.

Name This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.  Dr. Fauci wasn’t done yet, though. He went on to state another example that he was directly involved with where a treatment made individuals worse.  “One of the HIV vaccines that we tested several years ago actually made individuals more likely to get infected,” Fauci added.  The RSV vaccine’s failure was exposed in 2008 by researchers who finally untangled the decades-old mystery.  “In the late 1960s, children in Washington, DC received an RSV vaccine in which the virus was inactivated with formalin,” Reuters reported. “Eighty percent of the children given the shot were hospitalized with severe respiratory disease, and two died. Many scientists had thought the formalin was responsible for the vaccine’s problems, but the chemical has been used safely in other vaccines.”  “The problem, they report this month in the journal Nature Medicine, was that the children’s antibodies were not binding strongly enough to the inactivated virus to produce a protective immune response,” the report noted. “Instead, the antibodies were dragging the dead virus with them, triggering a massive attack by other arms of the immune system.”  It should be noted that in 2019, the NIH admitted that “we are still lacking a safe and effective RSV vaccine.” But it somehow developed a “safe and effective” Covid-19 vaccine in a matter of months?  As noted before, the American public has no way of knowing if the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was rigorously tested, because the FDA refuses to fully release the documents for 75 years. A “whistleblower” on the inside of Pfizer’s clinical trials has documented many alleged serious issues, including “falsifying data.”  The phenomenon that Dr. Fauci is alluding to, “leaky vaccines,” has been well-documented. A Penn State University study showed that “leaky” vaccines can cause viruses to become lethal for the unvaccinated.  “Not all vaccines prevent infection,” PSU noted. “Some, known as leaky vaccines, prolong host survival or reduce disease symptoms without preventing viral replication and transmission. Although leaky vaccines provide anti-disease benefits to vaccinated individuals, new research by CIDD’s Andrew Read, David Kennedy and colleagues at the Avian Oncogenic Virus Group in the United Kingdom, and The University of New England in Australia, has demonstrated that leaky vaccines can make the situation for unvaccinated individuals worse.”  “Leaky vaccines work by enhancing host immunity to a particular pathogen, without necessarily blocking or slowing viral replication,” the article continues. “The result is that infected but vaccinated individuals have extended survival, allowing highly virulent pathogen that would normally reach an evolutionary dead-end in a dead host, can transmit. The evolutionary consequences of high virulence are thus reduced and these pathogens can be selectively favored as a result of leaky vaccination. ”  A 2019 article in Healthline discussed the attempt to prevent Marek’s disease from spreading among chickens.  “After experiments done in a specialized pathogen-containment facility at The Pirbright Institute in the United Kingdom, the researchers concluded that the vaccines developed to combat Marek’s disease were imperfect or leaky,” the story notes.  “These vaccines also allow the virulent virus to continue evolving precisely because they allow the vaccinated individuals, and therefore themselves, to survive,” said Venugopal Nair, who led the research team.  “These less-than-perfect vaccines create a ‘leaky’ barrier against the virus,” the story continues. “Vaccinated individuals may get sick but have less severe symptoms, but the virus survives long enough to transmit to others, which allows it to survive and spread throughout a population.”  “Our research demonstrates that the use of leaky vaccines can promote the evolution of nastier ‘hot’ viral strains that put unvaccinated individuals at greater risk,” Nair said.  A new Harvard study recently showed that the mRNA “vaccines” endorsed by the FDA and CDC are worse than useless at stopping the spread of Covid-19.  The study of 68 nations and 2,947 counties in the United States published in the European Journal of Epidemiology showed that “At the country-level, there appears to be no discernable relationship between percentage of population fully vaccinated and new COVID-19 cases in the last 7 days. In fact, the trend line suggests a marginally positive association such that countries with higher percentage of population fully vaccinated have higher COVID-19 cases per 1 million people.”  That is exactly what Becker News had pointed out in September:  As the Covid pandemic continues to defy predictions about when it will finally be ‘over,’ there is a curious phenomenon taking place across the United States and around the globe: Covid-19 case rates increasing alongside vaccination rates. The textbook examples of this disturbing trend are the nations of Israel, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Israel is now experiencing its fourth wave, which is being accompanied by another round of ‘booster shots.’ Israel has 61.5% of all adults “fully vaccinated” (although the use of ‘booster shots’ throws the term into question.)  Meanwhile, a new independent study corroborates the famous Israeli study from August that shows natural immunity is superior to “vaccinated immunity.”  The latest study states that: “Confirmed infection rates increased according to time elapsed since the last immunity-conferring event in all cohorts. For unvaccinated previously infected individuals they increased from 10.5 per 100,000 risk-days for those previously infected 4-6 months ago to 30.2 for those previously infected over a year ago. For individuals receiving a single dose following prior infection they increased from 3.7 per 100,000 person days among those vaccinated in the past two months to 11.6 for those vaccinated over 6 months ago. For vaccinated previously uninfected individuals the rate per 100,000 person days increased from 21.1 for persons vaccinated within the first two months to 88.9 for those vaccinated more than 6 months ago.”  Thus, the vaccinated previously uninfected individuals are two-to-three times more likely to be reinfected after six months than unvaccinated previously infected individuals. One of the more useful aspects of this study is that it unpacks the overlap between vaccinated immunity and natural immunity; some research suggests the overlap between the two categories may be as high as 60-70%. Therefore, claims about “vaccinated immunity” may be benefiting from the fact that over half of the United States is estimated to have natural immunity.  The latest remarks from Dr. Fauci suggest that the NIAID chief is not surprised by the abysmal failure of the “vaccines” to stop the spread.

Most of the benefit comes from younger people not spreading it because they’re vaccinated, and that benefits, on a community basis, the elderly. “Here, we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they’re most at risk of that.

,"Military cadets at West Point Academy who refuse to take one of the controversial COVID vaccines are being put in solitary confinement, with more stringent restrictions than those who tested positive for the virus.  At West Point Military Academy, a number of cadets are currently rebelling against the push from the Biden administration and military higher-ups to take one of the controversial COVID-19 vaccines. 700 cadets who initially refused the vaccine were brought together into a meeting room, and were briefed as to the benefits of the vaccine. The number of cadets has now dwindled significantly after allegations of daily pressure by “senior officials” at the school, and rumors of reductions of leave. Some cadets relented and received the vaccine, while many left West Point due to the pressure.  Those who still refuse to take the vaccine are forced to wear masks everywhere, marking them out from everybody else who is vaccinated. A number of parents of those holdouts have now organized legal counsel on behalf of their children, with CDMedia reporting that they are “banding together to fight this perceived criminal behavior by those in power over their children.  An anonymous whistleblower, whose identity National File is protecting, gave a breakdown of the current restrictions that West Point cadets who refuse to take the COVID vaccine have to face. For those cadets returning for summer programs, they will have their two week leave shortened to one, as they have to spend 7 days in a quarantine that amounts to serious solitary confinement. The cadets are locked up for 23 hours each day in one room, and are only allowed out for one hour to walk or run outside.  Crucially, these cadets are not tested for COVID-19 before they are put into self-isolation. In fact, they are only tested at the end of the period. If they test negative, they will be released to their training programs. In a letter sent to the cadets deemed “high risk,” there was no detail as to what would happen if the cadet tested positive instead, in terms of whether they would be forced to endure another week or more of the solitary confinement. National File contacted West Point for details on this program via phone and email, but did not receive a response by the time of publication.  The new regime could not accurately be described as self-isolation or quarantine, as such programs already existed at West Point for cadets returning after the summer and Christmas breaks this academic year who tested positive. For those cadets, before the vaccination program kicked into high gear, they would be restricted at some points, but could also work out in the outside gyms, and leave their accommodation to go and order food, albeit being ordered to stay away from cadets who were not infected. These luxuries are not afforded to the cadets who refuse to take the vaccine, even though they may not have the virus.  West Point allegedly plans to round up all the cadets who are refusing the vaccine and transfer them into all one company or platoon based on how many they’re are. At the time of writing, around 50 cadets have not backed down. The whistleblower said this would likely be better for them, as they would not be around other troops who derogatorily shout at them, calling them “anti-vaxxers,” and instead would be with those who stand with them. “They’re being treated like criminals,” the whistleblower added. “They’re trying to protect other people’s rights and their rights are being compromised.”  National File reported last year on two successive suicides from the Colorado Springs Air Force, with students expressing to the academy that the deaths may have been linked to depression springing from the then extremely strict social distancing policies and punishments for violating the six-foot distance protocols. Following the deaths, looser restrictions were enacted.",EXCLUSIVE: Biden’s Military Puts West Point Cadets in Solitary Confinement If They Refuse COVID Vaccine,false,300647870900688744198621265127915881071
,"William Jefferson Clinton’s military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay began on Friday, following a three-day delay caused by a female panelist whose amorous display of affection toward the former president shocked the Office of Military Commissions.  The joviality and swagger Clinton displayed on Monday had evaporated when uniformed MPs escorted him to GITMO’s south courtroom Friday morning. A much more sullen and forlorn Bill Clinton, head hung low, was seated at the defense table beside the advocate he had chosen to represent him, the venerable David E. Kendall.  Kendall is an American attorney, a graduate of Wabash College, Yale Law School, and Worcester College, Oxford, who clerked with Supreme Court Justice Byron White, worked as associate counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and has been a partner at Williams & Connolly LLP of Washington, DC since 1981, where he has provided legal counsel to individuals and corporations on high-profile business and political matters. He represented Clinton during the 1998-1999 impeachment proceedings stemming from Clinton’s relations with White House intern Monica Lewinski.  At the start of Friday’s proceedings, Kendall boldly asked Rear Adm. John G. Hannink to “dismiss without prejudice” all charges leveled against Bill Clinton. Those charges include murder, sex crimes against minors, treason, theft of government property,  “President Clinton should not have to answer for the crimes of Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has already been sentenced and put to death. For many years, William Jefferson Clinton was largely oblivious to his wife’s transgressions, and once he became aware of them, he had only a peripheral involvement, at best. Make no mistake, she called all the shots. My client was along for the ride,” Kendall said.  “It was all Hillary,” Bill Clinton said.  But Vice Adm. Hannink was unimpressed at Clinton’s refusal to take accountability for his misdeeds. Paraphrasing author Peter Schweizer’s observation in the book Clinton Cash, Vice Adm. Hannink noted that “the couple that steals together, stays together,” and expounded on that theory by telling the tribunal that “apparently, the couple that kills together, stays together too.”  “And there is no statute of limitations on murder, not even for you, detainee Clinton,” Vice Adm. Hannink said.  “My client never killed anyone,” Kendall interjected.  His statement prompted Vice Adm. Hannink to play a taped telephone call for the tribunal. It was a 1993 conversation between Bill Clinton, then-Attorney General Janet Reno, then-ATF chief David Chipman, and former FBI director William Sessions. The call, recorded on day 50 of the Waco standoff between Branch Davidian leader David Koresh and U.S. alphabet agencies, underpinned Clinton’s mounting hatred of not only Koresh but also the women and children sheltered within the compound. Reno, Chipman, and Sessions urged Clinton to swiftly resolve the protracted stalemate, arguing that his indecisiveness would empower future “domestic terrorists” and religious zealots to follow in Koresh’s footsteps. Reno pleaded with Clinton to “burn them out,” and both Chipman and Sessions, after expressing mild trepidations, agreed the situation had become untenable. Clinton gave them “carte blanche,” and encouraged them to eliminate “malcontents” as long as blame was assigned to Koresh and the U.S. government was held harmless for any fatalities.  “I don’t care what happens to them, they didn’t vote for me anyway,” Clinton said on the call. “If they die, they die. Just make sure the finger can’t be pointed back at us, or more importantly, me. Let’s nip this in the bud right now.”  As most know, on day 51 the FBI and ATF launched a siege on the Branch Davidian Compound. A fire consumed the facility, and 76 Branch Davidians, including Koresh, 25 children, and two pregnant women, were reduced to ashes. Janet Reno later claimed that Koresh had burned out his own people, even though video footage of government vehicles and personnel equipped with flamethrowers and other incendiary devices surfaced in pictures and video.  On a recorded telephone call captured three days after the siege, Clinton congratulated Reno, saying the Branch Davidians “got what they deserved.”  In GITMO’s south courtroom, Vice Adm. Hannink replayed the recording several times.  “This was not Hillary; this was all you. You were president, not your wife. Nowhere is she heard on these calls. No one here is saying Koresh was a nice guy. But you, detainee Clinton, ordered those deaths,” Vice Adm. Hannink said.  Kendall objected, claiming the tapes had not been entered into discovery and, thus, he had been given no opportunity to rebut their validity.  “I understand you were an accomplished civilian litigator, Mr. Kendall, but this is a military commission, operating under full force and effect of the insurrection act,” Vice Adm. Hannink replied.  Kendall altered his tone and calmly requested a 72-hour continuance, until Monday morning, to allow him to authenticate the tapes.  “Very well, this commission will grant you your 72 hours, but we’ll tolerate no further delays after this,” Vice Adm. Hannink said.  He put the tribunal in recess until ten hundred hours Monday morning.

Before the challenge, Northern Ireland was the only UK country that didn’t take up the 1967 Abortion Act – meaning that terminations were only legally permitted in instances where the life or mental health of the mother was in danger.  Anyone who performed an illegal termination faced the prospect of life imprisonment in jail.  But a challenge to the legal ruling was brought in July by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commision NIHRC – who wanted to legalise terminations in cases of rape, incest or fatal foetal abnormality.

The bill is expected to easily pass as all professional sports events have been suspended indefinitely.  Ilhan Omar says the move was inspired by professional kneeler Colin Kaepernick. She says he spoke to her recently and inspired her to act:  “We had a meeting with Colin Kaepernick a few weeks ago and he talked to us about criminal justice reform and ways we can help.

,"The U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps on Wednesday convicted and sentenced Hunter Biden to death after 6 women appeared via ZOOM to testify how Biden and his handlers had lured them into no-escape situations where they were drugged, raped, and threatened to remain silent “or else.”  The first, a woman identified only as “Ashley,” recounted a disturbing tale about how her parents had introduced her to Hunter Biden at a 2016 diplomatic function in Washington, D.C. She was 15 at the time of the encounter.  “My parents were political donors and got invites to events. That man…Hunter Biden was at one of them. I was with my parents and their friends when he came over to say hello. He gave off creepy vibes to me right away…I was about to excuse myself to grab a soda when Hunter said he’d get it for me. I started to say ‘no thank you,’ but he was already walking toward the bar…or whatever it was. As he handed me the drink, he brushed a finger over mine and it sent chills down my spine. I shouldn’t have drank the drink. I felt lightheaded and my legs felt rubbery. Everything went blurry. And next thing I know he is holding my hand, leading me up a staircase.”  Rear Adm. Crandall and the 3-officer panel sat in silent contemplation as Ashely relived the horrid event in her mind. Handcuffed and seated across from them, Hunter Biden glanced away from the screen on which Ashley, tears welling in her eyes, continued her story.  “It was like my parents had just vanished. My body literally went numb and my speech was slurred. Next I’m on a bed, and he’s looming over me undressing himself and then…me. Everything was fuzzy but it was him. And then he put a camera on a tripod and got into the bed with me…and raped me, vaginally and anally.”  Rear Adm. Crandall asked her if she saw the villain in the tribunal chamber. She pointed directly at Hunter Biden and said, “Him.”  He then set a laptop on the prosecution table and told the officers they would bare witness to Hunter Biden’s crimes shown on a grotesque video, although everything except Hunter and Ashely’s faces had been blurred. The video showed a naked Hunter Biden flopping around atop a top a young girl whose face was identical to Ashely’s. She seemed spaced out, crying “stop, stop, stop” as Biden repeatedly raped her.  “We obtained this video from one of Biden’s devices. Ashley, is this you in this video. I know it’s difficult to see,” Rear Adm. Crandall said.  “Yes,” she muttered.  Hunter Biden objected: “May I pose a question? Is this tribunal expected to believe I whisked this girl away, drugged her, and did these things—when she was accompanied by her parents? This video is fabricated, false.”  “When I came to and realized what had happened and told my parents, they called me a liar, too,” Ashley said. “They told me it never happened. That it must have been a nightmare. I no longer speak to them.”  Five more young women appeared on Zoom to tell eerily related stories, and the 3-officer panel had to suffer through video snippets of Hunter Biden’s assault on each of them. Biden made vain and ineffective attempts at refuting their testimony and the veracity of the videos, but the tribunal didn’t give any credibility to his rebuttals. The last girl to testify claimed that Hunter and his father raped her together, but the video only showed Hunter, not Joe.

,"On June 21 the Office of Military Commissions convicted former Attorney General William Barr on charges of treason, buttressing Donald J. Trump’s assertion that Deep State operatives had infiltrated nearly every crevice of his administration. Upon learning of Barr’s fate, Trump reportedly told his inner circle “Justice was served” and that Deep Staters masquerading as Republicans are not impervious to military justice.  Real Raw News can now report that Barr was taken into custody on May 21, when U.S. Marines operating under the guidance of the Insurrection Act arrested the traitor at his McClean, Virginia, home. He was promptly taken to Guantanamo Bay, where he lived in a 6X9’ cell while awaiting his tribunal date.  On Tuesday Barr had his day in court. In an opening statement, he said he had been fiercely loyal to Donald J. Trump prior to his ousting. He said he had helped craft many of the indictments on which the military was now acting, under the belief that Trump was interested in “draining the swamp.” But in November Barr had an epiphany; he told the tribunal that Trump had instructed him to author indictments on persons who had no ties to the political arena, and that it was his opinion that Trump’s indictments were designed to settle personal scores and vendettas, not to restore political integrity.  “President Trump subverted my trust and judicial authority. When he showed me a list of people to be indicted, I was shocked. I asked him why this or that person was being indicted, and he told me ‘Because they’re criminals, Bill.’ When I asked for proof, he told me ‘Don’t worry, Bill, we’ll find the proof.’ I refused to participate any further in his witch hunt, and that’s why I tendered my resignation on 23 December,” Barr addressed the tribunal.  His explanation didn’t seem to impress Rear Adm. Darse E. Crandall, who had successfully prosecuted the military’s case against John Podesta.  “An interesting, largely fictional telling of what happened. Let’s be honest with each other here, Mr. Barr. You were given an opportunity to resign—to save face. Not that it mattered because, unbeknownst to you, you were already under scrutiny. If you had moral and ethical issues with the indictments back in April, May, June, July, August, September, October, and November, why would you wait until Dec 23 to resign? That doesn’t make much sense,” Rear Adm. Crandall said.  Barr countered that he wanted to give Trump every chance to realize he had taken a precipitous turn toward the dark side and to return to the light.  “I tried to help him,” Barr said.  “The truth is exactly the opposite, isn’t it, Mr. Barr. Trump kept you around because he keeps his friends close and his enemies closer, and he gave you every opportunity to amend your mistakes. Then you stabbed him in the back by denying election fraud and supporting a fraudulent president. And certainly you understand that bribery, especially for an appointed official, is akin to treason,” Rear Adm. Crandall said.  He showed the panel incontrovertible proof of Barr’s criminal maleficence—financial documents proving the Barrs—William and Christine—had received a $7,000,000 “donation” deposited into a 501C3 titled “Conservative Truth Initiative.” The depositor, a Chinese national with indisputable ties to the DNC, spread the funds across several bank accounts. The deposits had hit the Barrs’ accounts on 2 December, one day after Barr excoriated Trump on national television.  “I submit to you,” Rear Adm. Crandall told the three-officer tribunal, “that William Barr did knowingly collaborate with the enemy to undermine and delegitimize the democratically elected President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, and in doing so betrayed his oath to the U.S. Constitution. Simply put, treason.”  “What I did was take action to protect the United States. If I had to, I’d do it again. I’d do it five times over,” Barr said.  Fifteen minutes later, the panel found Barr guilty of treason, seditious conspiracy, advocating overthrow of government, recruiting for the service against the United States, and enlistment to serve against the United States, and decreed that he be executed for his crimes in accordance with U.S.C. Title 18 and provisions specified in the Insurrection Act of 1807.  Rear Adm. Darse has scheduled Barr’s hanging for August 2.

,"CORRECTION: This article originally published May 4, 2021, contained misleading information. It has now been corrected and updated.  The claim that there is no evidence trans girls perform better in sports better than cisgender girls was put forward by Dr Veronica Ivy, a doctor of philosophy. There has been no peer-reviewed study to support the claim.  Ivy’s claim that the data that’s currently available doesn’t actually show that transgender girls have the upper hand when it comes to performing in sports alongside cisgender girls was not supported by any evidence.  Advert 10  Ted Eytan/ABC News  A doctor of philosophy has said that there’s no evidence that transgender girls perform better in sports than their cisgender peers.  Dr. Veronica Ivy said that the data that’s currently available doesn’t actually show that transgender girls have the upper hand when it comes to performing in sports alongside cisgender girls.  She added that until there’s data proving this, transgender girls should be allowed to compete with cisgender girls.  Advert 10  TMZ  However, Dr. Ivy – who has a PhD in philosophy but who is not a medical doctor – did acknowledge that there is a difference in performance between biologically-born boys and girls in the world of sports, but the reason for this is still speculated. It’s believed it could be biological, sociological or a combination of both, TMZ reports.  Addressing whether it’s testosterone in men that makes them perform better, Dr. Ivy said on TMZ Live:  The truth is, we don’t know [what makes men better at sports compared to women]. But we do know now, finally, after all these years, that it isn’t as simple as natural testosterone. That is not the reason. There are elite world championship level men with natural testosterone below the women’s average, and they’re competing at no disadvantage to men with 100 times as much testosterone. So there are certainly, maybe, some biological reasons for men, on average, being bigger, stronger, faster than women, but we do know that there are also social reasons.  Advert 10  PA Images  Dr. Ivy went on to describe competition in sports as a ‘human right’, and the ongoing issues transgender people are facing in the sports world is because people continue to compare men to women and girls to boys, instead of transgender women to cisgender women, and so on.  She said, ‘If we’re talking about trans girls in girl’s sport, then we have to talk about the difference between trans girls and cisgender girls – not boys and girls.’  Dr. Ivy’s comments come after several US states banned transgender girls from competing in girl’s sports out of concerns that they have an unfair advantage. These rules have been implemented in states such as Mississippi, Tennessee and Kansas.  Advert 10  PA Images  It also comes after Caitlyn Jenner said that biologically-born boys shouldn’t be able to compete in girl’s sports. She said, ‘This is a question of fairness. That’s why I oppose biological boys who are trans competing in girls’ sports in school. It just isn’t fair. And we have to protect girls’ sports in our schools.’  She’s since received criticism for her comments as many expected her, as a trans woman herself, to be more supportive.","CORRECTION: No Evidence Trans Girls Perform Better In Sports Than Cisgender Girls, Says Doctor",false,154677032441099570057515460839906440707
9d41b6e2,"National Report Casey Anthony, the woman famously acquitted in 2011 of murdering her daughter Caylee, is confirmed to be pregnant again. This time with twins.
Previous reports on Anthony’s lifestyle in the three years since she was released from prison have described her as being withdrawn, and living like a hermit. Anthony filed for bankruptcy in 2013, claiming to be unemployed and possessing no source of income. She met with agents and publishers in New York last year, hoping to cash in on her notoriety by writing a book but was unable to close a deal. Casey currently appears to live off of a few benefactors who reportedly pay for all of her living expenses. But the days of needing to live off of others may soon be coming to a close for Anthony.
Casey’s New York agent, Jeremy Nieven, confirms that she is indeed four months pregnant with twins, and that she has signed a contract for an initial six episode reality television series that will showcase her pregnancy and subsequently her babies. “She wants to redeem herself in the eyes of America”, stated Nieven. “Did she make mistakes? Absolutely! But this is the U.S.A., everyone can get a second chance here. And let’s not forget that Casey was found innocent of the charges against her. She was released. She is a free woman now, and this show is going to allow her to make a great life for her new little angels.” But can people forget Casey Anthony’s actions? Many critics have claimed that Anthony’s acquittal resulted from a flawed prosecution, not from an actual lack of guilt. Can America forget that this woman partied it up at the clubs while hiding the fact that her two-year old daughter decomposed in the woods close to her family home? Can they forget the lies, the evasions and distortions that so easily came from her mouth? Apparently television executives say yes. Her notoriety translates to interest, and interest can translate to ratings. Casey’s agent refused to disclose the name of the network that had contracted with her for the reality series, saying that a press release was scheduled in September to break the show. Nieven did confirm that the show would be aired on one of the larger cable channels. Many people have reacted with disgust to the fact that Casey Anthony is pregnant again, and protests and calls for a boycott of the show is almost a certainty. But the real question is whether Americans will watch? Somewhere, someone in television is betting on yes. And Casey Anthony stands to make a lot of money from their bet.",The far-right sharing fake news — or conservatives sharing conservative journalism?,false,

According to the ad Soros placed on Craigslist, protesters would be fully compensated for all of their time and expenses. They found out that the money dried up the moment they got arrested.  A spokesman for the Soros company, Paid Liberal Trolls of America, says the men and women who signed up were told up-front that they should obey the law and not go to jail:  “They were paid for 6 hours at $30 per hour, plus a meal stipend of $40 per day. Add to that a very generous 70 cents per mile for travel and a big cookie, and these people were given neary $1K to be there. All they had to do was go home before curfew. They chose to stay, so they can pay their own bail.”  Soros has a bad habit of not paying bail for his protesters, citing case after case of people not showing up for court. “If they don’t show up. we don’t get those funds back, and we can’t write them off as a business expense,” said Attorney Joe Barron, “They should know better than to expect someone as kind as George Soros to just toss an extra $500 per person out the window.”  Some protesters might be satisfied with that answer, but most are not. According to their leader, Art Tubolls, the 163 people filing the suit will show at the Soros mansion in Deluth if they have to:  “We’re not afraid to protest for real. Charlie Kirk and Turning Point said they’ll fund that endeavor, even if it means he has to bail us out. That guy’s giant head is filled with kindness.”  Turning Point says they’re always happy to assist people looking to pick themselves up by the bootstraps and earn an honest day’s pay.

,"Editor’s Note: This statement corresponds with our 4-hour crowdsourced documentary featuring personal accounts from many soldiers. For further information, watch it here.  We are experiencing the most devastating attack on the U.S. military in history!  An estimated 350,000 of our military service members are being dishonorably discharged for refusing to take a completely unnecessary and experimental mRNA nanotech injection, which is now proven to degrade immune systems and cause many serious side effects.  Committing Total Force to these reckless injections, which do not protect troops from getting COVID, and, in fact, increase the threat of the spread and result in many provable side effects, is the greatest failure of military leadership in our history, at best. At worst, it is a deliberate treasonous attack against the U.S. military by the top of the Chain of Command.  To make matters even worse, an estimated 450,000 service members have recently been injected with the non-FDA approved Pfizer shot, even though many were falsely led to believe that they were getting the FDA-approved version, which is not even available in the U.S..  The outright lies, confusion and shocking lack of knowledge and incompetence demonstrated over the past week throughout the Chain of Command, which is covered in our 4-hour video here, is a low point in U.S. military history.  As you are reading this, many of these coerced troops are now beginning to experience side effects and COVID infection rates are increasing throughout the force. Many pilots are now grounded because of high risks of blood clots and heart failure while flying.  An estimated 400,000 military service members did not want the nanotech injections but submitted to taking them because they couldn’t afford to live without pay, benefits and the devastating scarlet letter of a dishonorable discharge.  A dishonorable discharge has severe ramifications when it comes to being employed throughout the civilian workforce. It is essentially sentencing many of our troops to a life of low-wage work and poverty in the draconian mandate economy, which also now demands injections for many jobs, with all the severe economic sanctions under the guise of “public health” that they will now face in civilian life.  Based on our assessments, it is now clear the Global Private Military Complex has captured the top of the U.S. military Chain of Command and is systematically degrading the U.S. military as part of a worldwide strategy to weaken national civilian militaries.  Our military is their greatest adversary and primary target.  Make no mistake, to dishonorably discharge thousands of our most elite fighting forces is a blatant Act of War against the American people.  The all-out systemic attacks against the American people are Acts of War.  There are so many outrageously corrupt activities and systemic abuses presently happening under the guise of “public health” throughout the government that it is now very obvious that the American people do not have any effective representation on the federal level.  The dishonorable discharge policy also makes it likely that many of our most elite fighting forces will now be inclined to take jobs as mercenaries in the Global Private Military Complex to support their young families – how convenient.  The American people are now up against the same imperial playbook of policies that have been strategically deployed to destabilize the Middle East, Latin America and many other nations worldwide. Now, the globalist “War on Terror” is targeting first world populations. This “mandate” attack against our military, police, doctors, nurses and other critical sectors is tactical destabilization 101.  Bottom line, there are significant numbers of people throughout the Intelligence Community, military, and Special Forces in particular, who know Rome has fallen.  The “New World Order” terrorists attacking humanity have become absurdly arrogant. We are experiencing the imperial overreach that occurs when an endangered oligarchy’s power structure collapses.  The compromised Biden Administration has also launched an attack against all U.S. veterans who do not submit to nanotech injections. As of November 1, all non-injected veterans will be denied V.A. healthcare – another Act of War to add to the long list of abuses.  There is also a new “Red Flag” gun law that targets veterans and newly discharged troops. If anyone reports them for vague and minor suspensions, they will have their guns taken away from them.  The Biden Administration is even trying to call in the United Nations’ Blue Helmet troops to be deployed throughout the U.S. to enforce international gun control and undermine our 2nd Amendment rights.  Everything that has happened over the past week is all coming right after a “deliberately botched” Afghanistan withdrawal, which was strategically designed to destroy troop morale and create division throughout the ranks.  In fact, Lt. Col. Stuart Sheller, who has been fighting this war for 17 years and is the highest ranking Marine to publicly speak out -- after 13 of his fellow troops were unnecessarily killed -- and demanded accountability from the top of the Chain of Command, is now a political prisoner in pre-trial brig solitary for an indefinite period of time, while no charges have even been filed against him.  Crimes Against Humanity  All of this is happening as more than 7,800 doctors and scientists have signed a “Physicians Declaration” condemning policymakers for “authoritarian” strategies that have resulted in “needless illness and death,” which amount to “Crimes Against Humanity.”  As we covered in our video, official COVID policies have led to over 500,000 unnecessary civilian deaths throughout the United States. The systemic shutdown of well-proven life-saving, safe and effective treatments, in favor of now well-proven harmful treatments, is blatant systemic medical malpractice.  Based on our assessments, it is clear that COVID is a bio-weapon that has been strategically released, and the spike protein and other ingredients in the mRNA nanotech injections are weaponized.  We also know that lockdowns have done significantly more harm than good, and now, with all these new mandates, our doctors, nurses and millions of essential workers throughout every sector of the economy are losing their jobs.  We are witnessing the deliberate incremental systematic dismantling and destruction of our country. The Global Private Military Complex is tactically turning America into Afghanistan and Iraq.  The amount of military movement throughout and around the continental U.S. is highly alarming. The designation and building of “internment facilities” under the guise of “public health,” and the fortification of Walmarts across the country, is also concerning.  The shocking complete opening of our entire Southern border by the Biden Administration is another new major National Security threat. We have credible intelligence that terrorists, drug cartels and global intel-backed mercenaries have entered the country and are being strategically deployed throughout the United States.  They are primarily targeting critical infrastructure and essential services, supply lines and states that are not enforcing “injection” mandates.  We are also deeply concerned about all the cargo ships that are now overwhelming all of our ports. Our supply lines of essential goods are being strategically disrupted and these ships and their unknown cargo represent an urgent critical National Security threat.  As we covered in our video, weapons systems, missiles and drones are suspected to be in some of these cargo ships. The military must immediately inspect and process every container.  We have a wide-open Southern border and we are surrounded by hundreds of cargo ships. In totality, it is a complete shitshow of systemic breakdown, corruption, incompetence and arrogance, and all this is happening right after the botched Afghanistan exit, which killed 13 troops and left behind $85 billion in weapons - and now we are discharging hundreds of thousands of troops while hundreds of thousands are now injected with a weaponized “vaccine.”  Clearly, Rome has fallen and rogue forces have compromised the Chain of Command.  The American people are under attack.  The Constitution is under attack.  We are under attack!  Therefore, we are now forced to engage tactical operations to save our nation and our families. We want to maintain peace while being surgical in detaining the terrorists.  Detain The Terrorists: Fauci, Gates, Schwab & Fink  As we highlighted in our video, the two most publicly known terrorists responsible for these systemic Crimes Against Humanity and Acts of War against the American people, and humanity in general, are Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates.  In addition, Klaus Schwab and Larry Fink have been key strategic driving forces behind overall systemic attacks against us.  ""Markets like totalitarian governments."" “Democracies are very messy, as we know in the United States.” “China has done a magnificent job of engineering their economy.” ~ The Shadow King of Wall Street, Larry Fink, Black Rock CEO, Czar of the Lockdown Economy  We are calling for the immediate detainment and prosecution of those four War Criminals.  Failure to do so, will result in a complete loss of faith in the Intelligence Community and the top of the military Chain of the Command.  We are also calling upon DoD and Intelligence Community Inspector Generals to immediately deploy large-scale wide-ranging investigations into corrupt policy decision-making processes and to conduct a forensic analysis of every move that every agency has made.  If the Office of the Inspector General does not move with immediate overwhelming force, their failure to act will result in a complete loss of faith in our systemic accountability mechanisms.  We want peace and Continuity of Government based on TRANSPARENT processes.  We have a duty and responsibility to protect our nation and our families from these barbaric and vicious systemic attacks.  We know that the Global Private Military is strategically attacking and systematically dismantling the United States and trying to incite division, desperation, confusion and chaos throughout the civilian population.  As the fog of war gets thicker than ever, we will do everything that we can to keep the peace and be a source of stability and critical information throughout the populace.  We are calling upon the American people to unite with their local Sheriff, police and community members to urgently begin full-scale preparations to protect their families.  We believe that the Global Private Military is going to launch terror attacks throughout the U.S. as they increase their asymmetric unconventional warfare against us.  We need to do everything in our power to prevent violent outbreaks.  The Global Private Military wants chaos and violence to erupt throughout our country - that’s why they have been proactively systemically undermining our ability to obtain basic necessities and dismantling critical infrastructure and dismissing hundreds of thousands of police, military, healthcare and essential workforces via non-scientific and non-sensical mandates.  They are deploying the same divide and conquer tactics that they have used to destabilize the Middle East; to get us to fight amongst each other and provoke a civil war. They are using their mainstream media companies to exacerbate confusion and division.  Whether it is inciting the vaccinated vs the unvaccinated or identity politics, it is driven by psychological operations (PSYOP) strategies. Identity politics are strategically designed to silo civilian populations off into the smallest possible demographics so they fight amongst each other while imperial forces take over.  Therefore, we need to unite, keep the peace and be surgical in our counter-offensives.  Let it be known to all who perpetrate attacks against the American people that the overwhelming majority of our Special Operations Forces, combat troops and a standing decentralized militia of over 40 million U.S. veterans and well-armed combat-ready civilians are now prepared to defend this country.  The unconventional warfare tactics deployed against us through COVID policies must come to an end now.  Know Your Primary Enemies  China and Russia are playing a role in this war against us. However, it must be known that the Global Private Military is trying to use China, Russia and other nation state adversaries as proxies for their interests.  The World Economic Forum, Business Roundtable, Black Rock, Vanguard and the most powerful global corporations have used and abused China and its people as a vassal state for low-wage sweatshop labor for decades. What they have done to the people of China they now want to do to the people of the United States.  In fact, the Chinese government recently officially declared billionaire George Soros as a “global terrorist.” Saying that he is, “the son of Satan” and “the most evil person in the world.”  We are calling upon the people of China and Russia to join us in this fight against our common enemy. The most powerful global imperial interests have been exploiting and abusing all of us. Now they are trying to get us to go to war with each other so they can enforce a tyrannical fascist New World Order.  It is absolutely critical to understand that the war against freedom and humanity is not a battle between nation states. The Global Private Military has no loyalty to any one nation state - the worldwide release of a bio-weapon and systemic oppression of all nations via draconian lockdown policies and mandates should now make that clear to everyone.  In many ways, COVID is the newest front in the 20-year old imperial power grab known as the “War on Terror.” Global imperial powers have brutally dominated the third and developing world for many decades. With COVID, the fascist imperial seed has now blossomed, and they are now targeting first world populations.  Bottom line, if we are going to survive all of these ongoing attacks against us, we have to be surgical in our counter-offenses and we must be laser-focused on the heads of the snake.  It is our goal to have them detained and legally prosecuted for Crimes Against Humanity - that’s why we are demanding the immediate detainment of Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab and Larry Fink as a first step in restoring faith in our government.  We all have a duty and responsibility to protect the Constitution of the United States against all enemies.  Let it be clearly understood: any government official who continues to be derelict in this duty is committing treason and is an accomplice in a war against the American people.  As the U.S. Supreme Court has made clear, it is up to you, the individual, to disobey unlawful, unconstitutional orders. You cannot legally defend yourself by saying you were just following orders.  It is now time for you to boldly stand up in defense of the American people.  The line is drawn.  What side of history will you be on?

,"A recent study from the Centers for Disease Control found mask mandates made less than a 2 percent difference in the daily death rates from the Chinese coronavirus and an even smaller percentage in case growth. From March 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020, the CDC found that in 2,313 American counties where mask mandates were issued, daily growth rates of the Chinese coronavirus decreased by only 0.5 percent in the first 20 days of being issued; they went down 1.8 percent within 81-100 days. Daily death growth rates from the virus decreased by 0.7 percent within the first 20 days of the mandates and 1.9 percent in 81-100 days. “Daily case and death growth rates before implementation of mask mandates were not statistically different from the reference period,” the CDC study states. States—focusing on changes in coronavirus case and death rates—began reopening while the CDC study was being conducted. “Changes in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates were not statistically significant 1–20 and 21–40 days after restrictions were lifted,” the report stated. The CDC found that within the 3,067 U.S. counties where in-person dining was restored, there was a 1.1 percent increase in daily growth rates of coronavirus cases within 81-100 days and a 3 percent growth in the daily death rate. “It is notable that no Randomized Controlled Trial from Oxford University has shown 90 percent effectiveness of masks against COVID,” West Texas Dr. Richard Bartlett told Texas Scorecard after reviewing the CDC’s study. “However, Oxford University did have a Randomized Controlled Trial showing 90 percent of COVID hospitalizations and ER visits might be avoided with early treatment with an inexpensive, safe, readily available medication.”",CDC: Mask Mandates Made No Statistical Difference,false,319312023022071125479384545152339222352
39c5f41b,"The Democrats in Congress just never seem to be satisfied. After the months of phony “impeachment” nonsense they put us all through, paid for by dipping into our social security funding, no less, now they’re dead set to cheat their way through the 2020 election. And who better to lead the crooked bandwagon than Little Sally Socialism herself, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.  Cortez is the author of congressional bill OU812 which would place an upper age-limit on legal voting within the United States to 65. After that age, no citizen would be able to register or even visit a local polling place, and all people currently above that mark would be permanently struck from the rolls immediately. The bill is gaining momentum in the Congress and is likely to pass, and with several Republicans in the Senate already beginning to turn against the conservative movement, it stands a good chance of becoming law. Cortez explained the reasoning behind the bill to a crowd gathered outside of her local nail-art emporium in Blumpkinville, New York:  “So, it’s like, old people – a lot of them get kind of dopey, you know? In their minds? They get Demen-entia. Or that really terrible one, Wisenheimer’s. And then they can’t make decisions very well. That’s why we end up with a professional con man like Trump, right? And then we have to go through all this trouble to impeach him and throw him out and fix their mistake, and it’s not fair. So I figure it could be eliminated altogether if we just stop them from voting stupid. They wont know. We can like, send them little pieces of paper, and they can write ‘Trump’ on them and we can just pat their heads and tell them we’ll put it in the voting car and it’ll drive it to the voting house or whatever. They won’t know the difference. Everyone happy. Okay, I have to go because I heard the new line of Hot Emoticon nail art is out and it’s SOOO delish.”  Experts agree that if the bill passes fairly soon, it will nearly destroy President Trump’s voting base and chances for re-election. But then again, experts also agreed that Killery was going to win in 2016, isn’t that right patriots? And you know, she basically did, but only for the grace of the electoral college, designed exactly for that reason by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Himself. We can only hope and pray that should this bill see the light of day, God will find another way to give America the mentally handicapped President she deserves.

5fd2bed1,"ABC's Isobel Markham reports:  With the threat of a govenrment shutdown looming, Rep. Tom Graves defended his effort to defund President Obama's signature health care law on This Week Sunday.  We are united around a very simple goal, and that is keeping the government open while protecting our constituents from the harmful effects of Obamacare, Graves said. We have eight days to do that.  The House voted on Friday 230-189 along party lines to pass Graves' bill - his first as a House member - that would extend funding for government operations until mid-December, while defunding the Affordable Care Act, passed into law in 2010. The defunding bill was put forward in the House by Graves, who has taken up the fight led in the Senate by freshman Tea Party Senators Ted Cruz, R-Tex. and Mike Lee, R-Utah to pull the plug on funding for Obamacare.  Friday's continuing resolution now heads to the Democratic-controlled Senate, where it will likely be rejected. Tea Party efforts to drum up support in the Senate for defunding Obamacare has yielded lackluster results, with many leading Republicans openly acknowledging the futility of the effort.  On This Week Sunday, House budget committee ranking member Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., dismissed the efforts to defund President Obama's health care law.  There's a reason Republican senators like Senator McCain and others are saying this is absolutely insane, Van Hollen said. They're going to shut down the government if they can't deny health care to millions of Americans.  ABC News  An ABC News/Washington Post poll this week showed that 52 percent are opposed to the law and only 11 percent believe Obamacare will improve their health care. Van Hollen puts this down to confusion surrounding the law, stirred up by Republicans.  I'm not surprised that there's a lot of confusion. These guys have been running around the country demagoguing, scare mongering on this issue, Van Hollen said. They're not afraid that it's going to be unsuccessful, they're afraid it's going to be successful and all of that misinformation will be shown to be a fraud.  Whenever there's a flood these days, you guys in the Republican Party say that's Obamacare, Van Hollen added.  And Van Hollen maintained that support for the health care law was made clear in the 2012 presidential election.  The biggest poll we had on this was the last election, Van Hollen said. President Obama said that she was going to implement the Affordable Care Act and Mitt Romney said he was going to defund it. And the president won on that issue and other issues.  Graves responded that since the election, the Obama administration has made changes to the law, including delaying implementation of certain portions for businesses.  Something very important has happened since the president did win the election and that he himself has amended, delayed, or repealed 19 components of his very own law, Graves said.  President Obama said Thursday he would veto any government funding bill that didn't include ACA funding. Failure to reach a resolution could result in government shutdown on October 1.

,"The chant “lock her up” has finally seen fruition.  US Navy SEALS loyal to Donald Trump raided Hillary Clinton’s Chappaqua, NY estate and arrested her on charges of treason, destruction of government property, and aiding and abetting the enemy, Real Raw News has learned.  The arrest happened on Tuesday night, according to a source in Trump’s orbit, only hours after Trump had spoken to Rear Admiral Hugh W. Howard at US Special Operations Command and given him a “mammoth trove” of evidence of Clinton’s criminality dating back to her days at the State Department. The evidence allegedly includes thousands of never-before-seen emails, which Clinton acid washed prior to the 2016 presidential election, as well as documents implicating her in plots to assassinate Republican legislators across the country.  The evidence was so compelling, our source added, that Adm. Howard had trouble believing that Clinton wasn’t arrested years ago.  “Trump’s been wanting to get her, and the rest of the Deep State cabal, ever since he set foot in the White House. It has taken him years to dig up the motherload. Once he had military support, he greenlit the operation. Trump’s team, for lack of a better word, had been surveilling Clinton a long time, and he knew she was always alone on Tuesday nights. That’s when the SEALS nabbed her,” our source said.  Under cover of darkness, an eight-man detachment from Naval Special Warfare Group 3 infiltrated the Chappaqua mansion shortly after 2:00am. Mysteriously, Clinton’s two-man Secret Service detail, which normally lives in a guest house on the property, was absent that morning. The SEALS cleared the main building, then silently breached the door to her bedroom, where they found her awake rehearsing a speech before a vanity mirror. They fired a single tranquilizer dart into her neck, our source said, before taping her mouth and sealing a black cloth bag over her head.  The SEALS also seized several laptops and reams of paper, our source said.  “I don’t know where they took her; only Trump knows that. But this is proof that Trump and the military have started taking out the cabal. It took him longer than expected, longer than he wanted, but better late than never. Trump is doing what’s right for America,” our source said.  Trump will soon send her to Guantanamo Bay to face a military tribunal for her crimes against America and its people. GITMO, our source said in closing, is run by the Marine Corps. and the US Navy, both of which have forsaken Joe Biden and instead pledged to help Donald Trump vanquish the forces of darkness that have enshrouded the nation in corruption for decades.

Found on page 105 of the agreement  The material transfer agreement was signed the December 12th 2019 by Ralph Baric, PhD, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and then signed by Jacqueline Quay, Director of Licensing and Innovation Support at the University of North Carolina on December 16th 2019.  Recipient signatories found on page 107  The agreement was also signed by two representatives of the NIAID, one of whom was Amy F. Petrik PhD, a technology transfer specialist who signed the agreement on December 12th 2019 at 8:05 am. The other signatory was Barney Graham MD PhD, an investigator for the NIAID, however this signature was not dated.  NIAID signatories found on page 107  The final signatories on the agreement were Sunny Himansu, Moderna’s Investigator, and Shaun Ryan, Moderna’s Deputy General Councel. Both signautres were made on December 17th 2019.  Moderna signatories found on page 108  All of these signatures were made prior to any knowledge of the alleged emergence of the novel coronavirus. It wasn’t until December 31st 2019 that the World Health Organisation (WHO) became aware of an alleged cluster of viral pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. But even at this point they had not determined that an alleged new coronavirus was to blame, instead stating the pneumonia was of “unknown cause”.  It was not until January 9th 2020 that the WHO reported Chinese authorities had determined the outbreak was due to a novel coronavirus which later became known as SARS-CoV-2 with the alleged resultant disease dubbed COVID-19. So why was an mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidate developed by Moderna being transferred to the University of North Carolina on December 12th 2019?  The same Moderna that have had an mRNA coronavirus vaccine authorised for emergency use only in both the United Kingdom and United States to allegedly combat Covid-19.  What did Moderna know that we didn’t? In 2019 there was not any singular coronavirus posing a threat to humanity which would warrant a vaccine, and evidence suggests there hasn’t been a singular coronavirus posing a threat to humanity throughout 2020 and 2021 either.  Considering the fact a faulty PCR test has been used at a high cycle rate, hospitals have been empty in comparison to previous years, statistics show just 0.2% of those allegedly infected have died within 28 days of an alleged positive test result, the majority of those deaths by a mile have been people over the age of 85, and a mass of those deaths were caused by a drug called midazolam, which causes respiratory depression, and respiratory arrest.

2695c66d,"Study Confirms Cannabinoids Occur Naturally In Human Breast Milk  In January 2017 a study confirmed that cannabinoids occur naturally in human breast milk-and it’s proving now to still be as relevant of a study as ever.  According to the findings of several major scientific studies, human breast milk naturally contains of the same cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant, which are vital for proper human development.  Cell membranes in the body are naturally equipped with these cannabinoid receptors which, when activated support and maintain human health. Human breast milk is an abundant source of endocannabinoids, a specific type of neuromodulatory lipid that basically teaches a newborn child how to eat by stimulating the suckling process.  Dr. Melanie Dreher studied women using cannabis during their entire pregnancy and then studied the babies one year after birth. She found that babies of the women who had smoked cannabis daily during their pregnancy socialised more quickly, made eye contact more quickly and were easier to engage.  If it were not for these cannabinoids in breast milk, newborn children would not know how to eat, nor would they necessarily have the desire to eat, which could result in severe malnourishment and even death. Newborn children who are breastfed naturally receive doses of cannabinoids that trigger hunger and promote growth and development.  Observations of how babies acts after being fed show they exhibit symptoms of cannabinoid use. As well as the essential function of stimulating an infants appetite, cannabinoids also help to calm and relax the baby. Cannabinoids are not, however, present in baby formula, which makes it far more inferior to breast milk.  Furthermore, a study on the endocannabinoid receptor system that was published in the European Journal of Pharmacology reported: “The medical implications of these novel developments are far reaching and suggest a promising future for cannabinoids in paediatric medicine for conditions including ‘non-organic failure-to-thrive’ and cystic fibrosis.”  There are two types of cannabinoid receptors in the body; the CB1 variety which exists in the brain, and the CB2 variety which exists in the immune system and throughout the rest of the body. Each one of these receptors responds to cannabinoids, whether it be from human breast milk in children, or from cannabis.  This essentially means that the human body requires and produces endocannabinoids, as these nutritive substances play a critical role in supporting and maintaining human health.

d1db1b6c,"Governor Andrew Cuomo is considering a temporary six-week ban on the sale of combustible cigarettes in order to reduce the State’s Coronavirus death count, a source familiar with his thinking tells The Chronicle. The ban could come as soon as Monday and is expected to be included in a budget measure already scheduled to be announced.  New data out of Italy suggest that the nation’s whopping Coronavirus death rate — now approaching 10% of those who test positive — is highly correlated to cigarette use. Italian men smoke cigarettes at rates that far outpace most other developed countries, and the extreme shortage of ventilators there has been the cause of death for tens of thousands of smokers.  According to Italy’s National Health Institute, smokers with COVID-19 were one-third more likely to have a serious clinical situation than non-smokers. Half of these smokers required a ventilator.  For many weeks, it was observed that women in Italy are better able to overcome the virus than men. Italian doctors now believe that the statistical difference is attributable to smoking-related gender norms.  COVID-19 kills its victims by compromising the respiratory system and reducing oxygen levels in the blood. Regular cigarette use damages the airways and small air sacs in the lungs. Combustible cigarettes weaken smokers’ lungs by filling them with smoke and tar.  “When a smoker contracts COVID-19, he or she will be far more likely to suffer respiratory system failure, thereby exacerbating New York’s ventilator shortage,” Cuomo plans to say in remarks prepared for Monday. “Fortunately, medical science informs us that ex-smokers experience significant recovery in lung function and oxygen absorption as soon as they quit smoking.”  Former smokers recover 30% of their lung function just two weeks after quitting.  “Any ex-smoker can tell you how, just days after quitting, they were noticeably less out of breath after walking up a flight of stairs. Personally, I have heard hundreds of these stories,” he writes in draft remarks.  Dr. Howard Zucker, the Commissioner of Health, is prodding Cuomo to issue the temporary ban and discussed the issue with him privately earlier this week. Zucker has long advocated for additional restrictions on combustible cigarette sales, which causes more than 443,000 deaths annually — more deaths each year than from murder, car accidents, alcohol or drug use, suicides, and HIV combined.  It’s estimated that 81,000 people will die from COVID-19.  Zucker argues that a ban on cigarette sales for the duration of the outbreak will save thousands of lives and will reduce the State’s shortage of ventilators, perhaps by several thousand during its peak — expected to hit the State 21 days from today.  Therefore, the Governor’s advisors postulate, if New York takes immediate action and temporarily bans combustible cigarette sales during this public health crisis, ex-smokers’ respiratory systems will make significant recovery at the very same time that COVID-19 cases are peaking in New York.  “This will save lives, and not just the lives of smokers,” the Governor plans to say. “Every former smoker that gets sick, but does not need a ventilator, means one more ventilator is available to keep our aging parents and grandparents alive.”  “Importantly, we must also recognize that failing to temporarily ban combustible cigarettes immediately will cause a disproportionate increase in COVID-19 fatalities in minority communities, given the higher prevalence of immuno-deficiencies in these communities,” he plans to note.  The Governor’s supporters argue that it is more important now than ever to address the public health cost of combustible cigarettes — not just to save the lives of smokers, but to save the lives of all New Yorkers by mitigating the severity of a ventilator shortage.

1263d1f6,"A 78-year old retired officer of the CIA, Normand Hodges, has made a series of astonishing confessions. He claims he committed 37 assassinations for the American government between 1959 and 1972, including the actress and model, Marilyn Monroe. Hodges says he has no regrets.  In amongst his many confessions, he admits to being a group member of five CIA agents, whose sole task was to carry out assassinations. He also admits one of his assassinations being none other than Glamour icon, Marilyn Monroe, who was killed not just because of her ties with John F Kennedy, but also because she slept with Fidel Castro, ultimately making her a massive national security risk.  Hodges says he has no regrets.  He claims he carried out 37 assassinations for the US Government between 1959 and 1972 including Marilyn Monroe.  Hodges had worked for the CIA.  Hodges was a CIA officer for 41 years working as an operative amongst top level security clearances, he claims he was employed as a hit-man by the organization, his duty was to assassinate individuals who posed a threat to the security of the United States of America.  He was trained as a sniper and a martial arts expert but also trained in other methods ranging from taking people out with poisons to using explosives.  Despite his old age, Hodges has managed to recall each of the assassinations he committed for the CIA. He goes on to admit that the murders were carried out on American soil and by the orders of his then commanding officer, Major James “Jimmy” Hayworth.  He also claims the timeline for the assassinations were between August 1959 and March 1972, when the “the CIA had its own agenda”. Furthermore, he admits that he was part of an operation team of five members, who were taking orders to carry out the assassinations. Their victims were from all walks of life ranging from journalists, union leaders, political activists, artists, and scientists – all of which were killed because their radical ideas posed a threat to the interests of the United States.  Hodges admits that Marilyn Monroe was the only woman he had ever assassinated, a unique target at the time. He claims she had become a significant “threat to the security of the country” and had to be eliminated.  “We had evidence that Marilyn Monroe had not only slept with Kennedy but also with Fidel Castro”, says M. Hodges. “My commanding officer, Jimmy Hayworth, told me that she had to die and that it had to look like a suicide or an overdose. I had never killed a woman before, but I obeyed orders… I did it for America! She could have transmitted strategic information to the communists, and we couldn’t allow that! She had to die! I just did what I had to do!”  Marilyn Monroe died on the 5th of August 1962. Hodges claims he entered her room while the star was sleeping, injecting her with a fatal dose of Chloral Hydrate a very powerful sedative that was also mixed with Nembutal – a short-acting barbiturate, which ultimately caused her death.  The FBI is taking Hodges claims very seriously and has now placed him under custody whilst a full investigation is opened to attempt to verify his allegations.  The most important witness in the case would have been Major James Hayworth, who died of a heart attack in 2011. Two other CIA assassins who were identified by Hodges are also dead.  This could open up many questions about the CIA’s activities in America in that era. What do you think? Why would Hodges say something like this if it weren’t true? Is it all conspiracy garbage?

This lawsuit had no chance of losing, as it was written up by famed Constitutional attorney, Chad Benoit, who has never lost a case in his 15-year career.  Justice Joe Barron, who made the decision, gave the following statement when issuing the verdict:  “Libel laws are essential to Democracy. They keep the press honest, and they keep the truth from being washed away. That is why I rule in favor of Donald Trump. CNN has said so many nasty things about him. Despite being truthful, it is wrong to say bad things about the President, as that is un-American. FOX News never said nasty lies about Obama, so why should CNN be able to?

,"OPINION:  The Biden administration has justified its new COVID-19 vaccination mandate as an “emergency power.”  But just where is the emergency?  If we’re facing such grave danger from the COVID-19 pandemic, then why did it take the Biden administration two months to draft its OSHA ruling on private businesses that employ more than 100 people? If there’s such a medical emergency, why did the Biden administration delay its mandate implementation date nearly a month from Dec. 8 to Jan. 4, conveniently after the holidays to minimize workforce disruptions?  The fact of the matter is COVID-19 case rates have been declining precipitously nationwide. The number of new daily COVID-19 cases has dropped 57% nationally since peaking on Sept. 1, as more people get vaccinated or recover and enjoy natural immunity. Some 67.7% of the American population has received at least one dose of the vaccine, and 58.5% have been fully vaccinated. Nearly 86% of adults over the age of 65 have been fully vaccinated – hitting Dr. Anthony Fauci’s “75 to 80-plus%” target on reaching herd immunity.  Not surprisingly, Dr. Fauci has been quietly raising his estimates throughout the past year, telling The New York Times in September a 70% to 90% range is more likely. Still, the World Health Organization cites a 60% to 70% range as the goal for achieving herd immunity.  COVID-19 death rates are also declining nationwide and hospitals are no longer overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients.  “In another month to two months, I think we’ll be on the back end of this, and prevalence will be very low, and you’ll start to see local communities lift restrictions. Some are already lifting them,” former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb predicted this week on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “I think that we’re close to the end of the pandemic phase of this virus.”  In addition to vaccines being widely available, both Pfizer and Merck have developed oral pills awaiting federal authorization that can treat COVID-19 cases at home, cutting both hospitalization and fatality rates. The drug Ivermectin has been used successfully on some patients when prescribed by a doctor, as has hydroxychloroquine. Both are FDA-approved inexpensive generic drugs that have been used for decades to treat other ailments.  For young, healthy adults, there’s a 99.9% chance they’ll survive the disease if they come down with COVID-19, and on average, 98.2% of known COVID-19 patients in the U.S. survive. Coupled with high voluntary vaccination rates, these odds certainly don’t seem like they constitute a medical “emergency.”  Clearly, the Biden administration’s desire is to prolong the COVID-19 pandemic for as long as possible. Why? So they can exert greater state control over the American population with their “emergency rulings.” From a public policy perspective, however, this approach is coming at great cost. Twenty-seven states have filed lawsuits against Mr. Biden’s vaccination mandate and on Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ordered a stay on its implementation.  Thousands of front-line workers have lost their jobs for refusing to get a jab, and airlines have had to cancel flights because of vaccination mandates.  COVID-19 fears have crippled our supply chain and sparked a labor shortage. Imposing a vaccination mandate on private businesses will only exacerbate these crises. Even the Biden team seems to know it, which is why they pushed back the implementation deadline until after the holidays.  “The people that operate the pickup and delivery systems, the warehouses and the fulfillment and sortation centers that make this country’s logistics system go, there’s a fair number of them, a large percentage, that simply do not want to be vaccinated,” Fred Smith, the CEO of FedEx, explained on Sunday to CBS “Face the Nation. “That’s not just hearsay. I was in a couple of our facilities just two days ago and had that confirmed by a number of our front-line managers. And it’s what we’re hearing throughout our system. So, this was a wise decision to move the mandate.”  Mr. Biden didn’t want to ruin Christmas with his federal overreach, hence the delay. It’s politics, pure and simple. If we were actually in an “emergency,” as the administration claims, it would be easy for the president to explain to the American people why Christmas should be canceled this year. But he can’t because we’re not. And everybody knows it. Everybody except Mr. Biden.  The pandemic is over, but the Biden administration will never admit it. Our leaders will keep moving the COVID-19 goalposts to preserve their position and power. It’s up to the American people to resist and for the courts to stop them.  • Kelly Sadler is the commentary editor at the Washington Times.

,"New Mexico lawmakers are swiftly on their way toward legalizing the killing of unborn babies in abortions up to birth for years to come.  The Daily Post reports the state Health and Human Services Committee passed House Bill 7 with bipartisan support on Wednesday. The vote was 8-3, and the bill now heads to the state House Judiciary Committee.  The pro-abortion bill would repeal a 1969 statute that prohibits abortions except in cases of rape, incest or threats to the mother’s life. The statute is not in effect because of Roe v. Wade, but if it is repealed, the state would continue to allow unborn babies to be aborted for any reason up to birth even if Roe is overturned.  It also would repeal the only conscience protections for pro-life medical workers in New Mexico. Currently, the law protects doctors, nurses and other medical workers from discrimination if they refuse to abort an unborn baby based on “moral or religious grounds.”  A state Senate committee passed an almost identical bill earlier this week.  However, pro-life leaders and medical workers are pushing back, saying the bill would strip away vital protections for healthcare workers, babies and mothers.  “Regardless of your position on abortion, no one should be forced to participate, to violate her most deeply held principles or the reason she entered the medical field – to save lives,” Catherine Glenn Foster, president of Americans United for Life, told the committee prior to the vote.  Foster said tens of thousands of healthcare providers in New Mexico would lose their conscience rights and they could sue the state for violating their religious freedom.  During a Senate hearing earlier in the week, state Sen. Gregg Schmedes, R-Sandoval, warned that doctors may leave New Mexico if the bill passes.  “Though some of the existing law is unenforceable because of Roe v. Wade, this statute contains important provisions that protect our doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals,” Schmedes said, according to the Los Alamos Reporter. “As a medical doctor, I have heard from many of my colleagues that if they lose these vital conscience protections, they will consider leaving the state which would threaten healthcare access for many New Mexicans.”  But state Rep. Micaela Lara Cadena, D-Mesilla, a sponsor of the bill, argued that the 1969 statute needs to be repealed because it is “outdated and dangerous.”  “Pregnant people and their families deserve continued access to safe and legal abortion,” Cadena said. “By repealing this dangerous statute, we are making sure this ban is never enforceable in New Mexico again.”  The AP predicts the bill will pass the Democrat-controlled state legislature. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a pro-abortion Democrat, also supports it.  But pro-lifers are not giving up hope. Elisa Martinez, executive director of the New Mexico Alliance for Life, urged New Mexico residents to call their lawmakers and urge them to reject the bill.  “The radical abortion lobby seeks to force medical professionals across New Mexico to perform abortions as a matter of ‘access.’ This is not a pro-woman bill but rather, a pro-abortion lobby bill,” Martinez said.  In 2019, a bipartisan group of lawmakers defeated a similar pro-abortion bill in the state Senate. However, many of the Democrat lawmakers who voted against it no longer serve in the legislature.  The bill is similar to laws that passed recently in New York, Vermont, Massachusetts and Rhode Island.

According to the Marshals’ office, they logged 14 boxes of material evidence deemed to be conducive to the ongoing investigation.

When migrants are prosecuted for illegal entry and plead guilty, the proceedings are short - often within the same day. After, they are quickly reunited with their children. Where things get complicated is when a migrant in criminal proceedings files an asylum claim. In that scenario, they are detained for a longer period of time than the government is legally allowed to hold them with their children.
The reason for that is a ruling by the liberal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals known as the Flores Settlement. This ruling prohibits the government from detaining alien children for more than 20 days. Even if the government wants to detain a family together, it’s legally forbidden from doing so. Because of the Flores Settlement, and subsequent court decisions, the Obama Administration doubled down on the policy to release parents in asylum proceedings who were accompanied by children. The results were predictable: From 2012 to 2017, asylum claims from Central America soared almost 900 percent. Not surprisingly, the “catch and release” policy incentivized migrants to bring children into the U.S. to avoid detention. It also incentivized parents to send their children with other adults so they could claim asylum as a family unit at the border, even while their parents stayed home. The unintended consequences of “catch and release” are tragic: An exponential increase in illegal immigration; numerous children abused; countless women raped; and untold numbers of men and women killed, drowned, starved or dead of dehydration in the perilous journey to the U.S. What makes these tragedies so unnecessary is there’s already a process in place for those who are legitimately seeking asylum. They can show up at any embassy or consulate abroad or any U.S. port of entry to make their asylum claims. Tellingly, these migrants refuse to make their claims at designated points and continue to pour into our country illegally. This strongly suggests that most migrants are coming to the U.S. for economic reasons, not because they have valid claims of persecution. The Trump Administration, to its credit, wants to solve the immigration crisis. In an effort to discourage migrant families and children from embarking on this treacherous journey, the administration started prosecuting all adults illegally crossing the border, instead of giving a free pass to adults who arrived with children. This led to over 2,000 alien children being temporarily detained away from adults. This, in turn, caused the media firestorm that brought Washington to a standstill. What’s interesting is that many in the media conveniently forgot that the Obama Administration also separated families at the border. At least the Idaho Statesman got it right when it ran a story last week titled, “Yes, Obama separated families at the border, too.” In 2014, when the crisis started under President Obama, the Idaho media was largely silent about this issue. The government continued to separate families in 2015, 2016, and 2017. But when President Trump took steps to end “catch and release,” there was an explosion of media interest. I support President Trump’s policy to prosecute those who are violating our immigration laws. I also support his executive order from June 20 that keeps migrant families together while directing the government’s lawyers to ask for a modification of the Flores Settlement. I have worked with my House colleagues on legislation that would keep migrant families together without reverting to the failed “catch and release” policy. The bill we propose would also close loopholes in asylum law to curb fraud and abuse. This will reduce illegal crossings, while also protecting those who have legitimate asylum claims. My proposed solution is supported by the majority of the American people. In a recent CBS News poll, 63 percent of Americans support keeping families together through better enforcement of our immigration laws. Only 21 percent support the “catch and release” policy advocated by Democrats and the liberal media.
Fixing our broken immigration system was President Trump’s No. 1 promise to the American people in the 2016 election. It’s also the No. 1 issue I’ve worked on as a member of Congress, and I will continue to work on it until my last day in office. I am committed to working with President Trump to keep families together and to make our entire country stronger and safer.

The new serological data, which is provisional, suggests that coronavirus infections greatly outnumber confirmed covid-19 cases, potentially by a factor of 10 or more. Many people experience mild symptoms or none at all, and never get the standard diagnostic test with a swab up the nose, so they’re missed in the official covid-19 case counts. Higher infection rates mean lower lethality risk on average. But the corollary is that this is a very contagious disease capable of being spread by people who are asymptomatic — a challenge for communities hoping to end their shutdowns. The crude case fatality rates, covering people who have a covid-19 diagnosis, have been about 6 percent globally as well as in the United States. But when all the serological data is compiled and analyzed, the fatality rate among people who have been infected could be less than 1 percent. But as infectious disease experts point out, even a seemingly low rate can translate into a shockingly large death toll if the virus spreads through a major portion of the population. [Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.] New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) said Monday that the latest antibody numbers in New York City indicate that 25 percent of the population of 8.8 million has already been infected. The city has recorded more than 12,000 confirmed covid-19 deaths, and lists another 5,000 as probable deaths. That is an infection fatality rate between 0.5 and 0.8 percent, depending on which death toll is factored in. (A spike in all-cause deaths in recent weeks also suggests that some coronavirus-related deaths have not been captured by mortality statistics.) “The death rate is much, much lower,” Cuomo said Monday, referring to the serology tests. He said the New York state rate appears to be 0.5 percent — which is one death per 200 infections. That figure is still sobering to infectious disease experts. A rate of 0.5 percent “is way more than a usual flu season and I would think way more than the ’57 or 1968 [influenza] pandemic death toll, too,” Viboud said. This is a novel, highly infectious virus, and so everyone who hasn’t had an infection is presumably susceptible. It is unclear whether and for how long a person who recovers from covid-19 will have immunity. Research shows that, in a completely vulnerable population that takes no precautions, each infected person will infect well more than two others on average, and some estimates put that reproduction number over three.  Epidemiologists have said somewhere between 40 to 70 percent of the population will likely become infected in the next couple of years if there is no vaccine and the public does not take aggressive measures to limit the spread of the virus. “Do the math!” said Jeffrey Shaman, a Columbia University epidemiologist who has been studying the coronavirus since early in the outbreak. Shaman and his colleagues have developed a model of the coronavirus spread that estimates that only 1 in 12 infections in the United States have been documented in official counts. That leads to an infection fatality rate of 0.6 percent, he said — a figure that roughly matches what has been seen in New York City. At that rate, the United States could potentially experience 1 million deaths if half the population became infected and no efforts were made to limit the contagion through social distancing, a vaccine or proven therapeutics, Shaman said. “That’s 20 times worse than a bad flu season,” he said Monday. This is obviously a highly politicized pandemic, and some critics of the nationwide shutdown have seized on this early antibody data to argue that covid-19 isn’t all that deadly. A common refrain is that the disease is not significantly worse than the flu. In this view, the pandemic threat has been wildly exaggerated. “Pandemic Is Over. Let’s Stop the Economic Suicide, and Get Back to Work,” declared a headline on a column by free market advocate George Gilder on the RealClearMarkets website. He said policies to control the viral spread “should be reversed summarily and acknowledged to be a mistake, perpetrated by statisticians with erroneous computer models.” Kevin McCullough, a columnist for the conservative website Town Hall, wrote a column that ran last week with the headline “Antibody Testing: Proves We’ve Been Had!” “Nearly everything we’ve been told about models, rates of infection, deaths, and recoveries was inaccurate,” he wrote. “The death rate in New York State isn’t 7.4%, it is actually .75%.” But the two numbers describe different things: The first is a case fatality rate, reflecting deaths among people with confirmed diagnoses of covid-19. The second is the infection fatality rate, extrapolated from the antibody surveys. In other words, both numbers can be correct, and useful. “Those higher numbers of case fatality rates, they’re still true,” Viboud said. “It’s your probability of dying if you’re clinically sick with it, which is something that people may care about, too.” Moreover, the fatality rate of a virus, however it is defined, is not an innate feature of the pathogen. It depends on many variables, including the age and health of the population and access to health care. Timing matters, too: In China the fatality rate was high during the initial phase of the outbreak, when hospitals were overwhelmed and doctors struggled to cope with the crisis. AD There are so many numbers flying around that it is understandable that people may struggle to make sense of them. That’s become even more difficult in recent days due to serological studies that haven’t been peer-reviewed but have been presented to the public, typically with dramatic public health conclusions attached. The most controversial such study came out of Santa Clara County, Calif., the heart of Silicon Valley. It claimed that the true number of infections in the county in early April may have been 50 to 85 times the official coronavirus case counts. Extrapolating from that, it gave an estimated infection fatality rate of between 0.12 and 0.2 percent. That provided what seemed like reliable ammunition to those who believe the danger of covid-19 has been overstated. They said the numbers show this disease is not much different from seasonal flu. AD A commonly cited statistic about seasonal flu is that it has a fatality rate of 0.1 percent, That, however, is a case fatality rate. The infection fatality rate for flu is perhaps only half that, Viboud said. Shaman estimated that it’s about one-quarter the case fatality rate. Thus, even if the Santa Clara numbers are roughly accurate about the spread of the virus and its lethality, it would still be deadlier than the flu. Statisticians and other epidemiologists have argued that there were also errors in data analysis in the Santa Clara report, which was led by researchers at Stanford University. The researchers used advertisements on Facebook to call for volunteers, and critics said that may have led to an unrepresentative sampling of the county. The critics noted that even a small rate of false positives can skew a survey in which the targeted disease has low prevalence. AD Shaman, the epidemiologist, said he hopes the higher estimates for infections and commensurately lower fatality rates are correct. Everyone needs more testing and better data, he said. For now, the preponderance of evidence describes an exceptional pathogen. For someone like Shaman, who wears a mask when he walks the dog in New York City and is conscientious about washing his hands, there is no doubt that the endgame is far away — that until a vaccine or reliable therapeutics are in place, or when so many people have been sickened and then recovered that the country achieves “herd immunity,” everyone needs to try to limit the spread of the virus. “We have completely disrupted our society through our social distancing practices, shutting our businesses, closing our schools, and still this thing has already killed 53,000 people in the United States,” he said. “We have a very long way to go until we get herd immunity.”",false,
65dd63fc,"Voters line up for the first day of early voting outside of the High Museum polling station in Atlanta, Georgia on Dec. 14, 2020. (Jessica McGowan/Getty Images) Trump Won Two-Thirds of Election Lawsuits Where Merits Considered The claim often repeated by the mainstream media, social-media content moderators, and fact-checkers that lawsuits filed by President Donald Trump’s campaign and Republicans were universally dismissed by the courts is untrue, according to a new analysis. The findings do not necessarily suggest that if the lawsuits had all been decided before Joe Biden was certified as the official winner of the presidential election by Congress on Jan. 7 that former President Trump would have won the hotly contested election. Nor would they necessarily have affected many of the Electoral College votes won by Biden in the disputed battleground states. Some of the legal victories took place in states like Colorado and Iowa where the popular vote counts for the respective winners of those states –Biden in Colorado and Trump in Iowa— were not close. Of the 22 cases that have been heard by the courts and decided on their merits, Trump and Republicans have prevailed in 15, according to citizen journalist John Droz Jr., a physicist and environmental advocate in Morehead City, N.C. This means Trump has won two-thirds of the cases fully adjudicated by the courts. Droz and a team of volunteers dug through court filings and legal minutiae to track down 81 lawsuits that were filed in connection with the Nov. 3, 2020 presidential election. The lawsuits were tracked on Droz’s publicly available spreadsheet that was current as of Feb. 6. Of the 81 cases, 11 were withdrawn or consolidated and 23 were dismissed for lack of standing or on other grounds. Both the cohort of 11 and of 23 should not be considered “wins or losses for either side,” Droz says, because they “have nothing to do with the merits of the case.” This leaves 47 cases. Of those 47, 22 have been finalized after the court heard arguments, considered evidence, and then issued a ruling. Of those 22, Trump or Republicans won 15 and lost 7, according to the analysis. This leaves 25 lawsuits that have yet to be finally disposed of. This means Trump and Republicans “have WON the majority of 2020 election cases fully heard, and then decided on the merits!” Droz said in a statement. “Is that what the mainstream media is reporting?” Among the legal victories for Republicans were: RNC v. Miller, in the Iowa courts, a lawsuit in which the Republican National Committee won an injunction over absentee ballot applications. RNC v. Gill, in the Iowa courts, in which the Trump campaign won an injunction preventing a county official from distributing and accepting signed forms containing preprinted information. Trump for President v. Boockvar, in the Pennsylvania courts, in which the Trump campaign was granted an injunction against the counting of mail-in and absentee ballots where voters were allowed to provide proof of identity days after Election Day. Droz noted that only three lawsuits addressed voting machine inaccuracies. “One of these was dismissed (due to jurisdiction), one was ruled against (although no discovery was granted), and one is still open (discovery was granted).” “The likely explanation for so few cases in these two areas is that legally proving fraud or voting machine manipulations are very time-consuming processes, that require substantial investigative work and documentation. There simply wasn’t enough time to do this prior to key points in the process (like the Electoral College).” “Our view is that the public needs to be much better educated regarding the election integrity issue—and having a more accurate understanding of the lawsuit component is a key part of that,” Droz wrote, explaining the purpose of his report.",Carbon dioxide hits a level not seen for 3 million years.

,"What this study finds is exactly what vaccine developer Geert Vanden Bossche (Belgium) has been predicting.  The predominance of antibody-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants in vaccine breakthrough cases from the San Francisco Bay Area, California. [DATA LINK HERE] The California study finds that vaccinated individuals are more susceptible to COVID variant infections than unvaccinated.  Geer Vanden Bossche has been warning that vaccine antibodies would suppress natural antibody responses.  The vaccine antibodies take control of the immune system and defend only against a targeted virus. Among vaccinated individuals, a COVID variant virus is not recognized by the specialized antibodies provided by the vaccine, and the natural antibodies have been programmed to stand down. (MedRxiv) Associations between vaccine breakthrough cases and infection by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants have remained largely unexplored. Here we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences and viral loads from 1,373 persons with COVID-19 from the San Francisco Bay Area from February 1 to June 30, 2021, of which 125 (9.1%) were vaccine breakthrough infections. Fully vaccinated were more likely than unvaccinated persons to be infected by variants carrying mutations associated with decreased antibody neutralization. […] These findings suggest that vaccine breakthrough cases are preferentially caused by circulating antibody-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants, and that symptomatic breakthrough infections may potentially transmit COVID-19 as efficiently as unvaccinated infections. (read more) Be careful around vaccinated people, because they can carry a more resistant form of COVID-19.  Additionally, the highly specialized antibodies in the vaccine create a need for a booster for each antibody resistant variant.  Israel is already on booster #2. Dr. Vanden Bossche has been using Israeli data and showing how the widespread vaccination rates were creating pressure on the virus to mutate into variants with higher levels of contagion. The unvaccinated group has been keeping the pressure down by defeating the virus and carrying natural immunity. However, as the unvaccinated population is increasingly made smaller, the pressure on the virus to mutate increases. Subsequently, these mutations stay at higher or more effective levels of infection. Israel is already on its second round of booster shots. The long term impacts of antibody dependency are unknown.  Some doctors and scientists are already worried that normal cancer fighting antibodies will become dormant and we could see an explosion of unusual cancer clusters due to antibody suppression caused by the COVID vaccines. [Diminished natural killer cells] Remember, no one knows exactly what this targeted vaccine will do to the overall human immune system as it responds to other viruses or infections.  The vaccinated population are the human trial subjects, and the unvaccinated population are the control group. In the U.K. data study there were: 157,400 Delta variant cases amid the fully vaccinated (26.52% of total cases), and 257,357 Delta variant cases amid the unvaccinated (43.36% of total cases).

Per consideration for all the states still in question, President Trump is currently winning the 2020 election. Here is what we already know. A number of states have been called but a number are still in question. Here is a list of those in question. Pennsylvania – although the current counts show Biden leading there is so much corruption in this state that it is likely that this state will never come to a transparent and agreed upon decision on who wins this state. President Trump was up by 700,000 votes on election night but more than a million ballots were added since that which eventually stole the election for Biden. The President has a clear path to victory once the illegal votes are addressed. TRENDING: You Son of a Bitch! YOU PUNK! - Geraldo LOSES IT ON LIVE TV after Dan Bongino Lays Him Out on Hannity!

The current lead for Biden is only 20,000. If these votes or the exception in the numbers in Rock County are addressed, Trump will likely win this state by a large margin. Michigan – this state is as well full of fraud. Lawsuits are in place. In addition there were over 100,000 votes dumped in Detroit and the lead here was stolen from Trump as well. Once the illegal votes are eliminated President Trump has a very good chance of winning this state as well. Georgia – this state too has much fraud. The President was winning this state on election night by 100,000 votes. But after the election a program was put in place to basically harvest a number of ballots. Now Biden leads in this state as well. Once the harvested ballots are thrown out, this state will go to Trump as well. Nevada – there is much fraud here as well. Signatures were not verified on hundreds of thousands of votes. It is likely that President Trump will win this state if any of the ineligible votes are eliminated here as well.

The US accusations against us are completely groundless. Russia acts in full compliance with the agreements and their terms — as well as with the agreement on the destruction of chemical weapons, Serebrennikov said.

According to the bill, the United States will not obligate any funds to implement the Open Skies Treaty until penalties are imposed against Russia for previous violations.

Addressing those allegations, Moscow stated that it fully complied with its obligations under the agreement. The Treaty on Open Skies was signed in 1992 and became one of the measures to build confidence in post-Cold War Europe. It has been operating since 2002 and allows participating countries to openly collect information on each other's military forces and activities.

,"William Jefferson Clinton’s military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay began on Friday, following a three-day delay caused by a female panelist whose amorous display of affection toward the former president shocked the Office of Military Commissions.  The joviality and swagger Clinton displayed on Monday had evaporated when uniformed MPs escorted him to GITMO’s south courtroom Friday morning. A much more sullen and forlorn Bill Clinton, head hung low, was seated at the defense table beside the advocate he had chosen to represent him, the venerable David E. Kendall.  Kendall is an American attorney, a graduate of Wabash College, Yale Law School, and Worcester College, Oxford, who clerked with Supreme Court Justice Byron White, worked as associate counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and has been a partner at Williams & Connolly LLP of Washington, DC since 1981, where he has provided legal counsel to individuals and corporations on high-profile business and political matters. He represented Clinton during the 1998-1999 impeachment proceedings stemming from Clinton’s relations with White House intern Monica Lewinski.  At the start of Friday’s proceedings, Kendall boldly asked Rear Adm. John G. Hannink to “dismiss without prejudice” all charges leveled against Bill Clinton. Those charges include murder, sex crimes against minors, treason, theft of government property,  “President Clinton should not have to answer for the crimes of Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has already been sentenced and put to death. For many years, William Jefferson Clinton was largely oblivious to his wife’s transgressions, and once he became aware of them, he had only a peripheral involvement, at best. Make no mistake, she called all the shots. My client was along for the ride,” Kendall said.  “It was all Hillary,” Bill Clinton said.  But Vice Adm. Hannink was unimpressed at Clinton’s refusal to take accountability for his misdeeds. Paraphrasing author Peter Schweizer’s observation in the book Clinton Cash, Vice Adm. Hannink noted that “the couple that steals together, stays together,” and expounded on that theory by telling the tribunal that “apparently, the couple that kills together, stays together too.”  “And there is no statute of limitations on murder, not even for you, detainee Clinton,” Vice Adm. Hannink said.  “My client never killed anyone,” Kendall interjected.  His statement prompted Vice Adm. Hannink to play a taped telephone call for the tribunal. It was a 1993 conversation between Bill Clinton, then-Attorney General Janet Reno, then-ATF chief David Chipman, and former FBI director William Sessions. The call, recorded on day 50 of the Waco standoff between Branch Davidian leader David Koresh and U.S. alphabet agencies, underpinned Clinton’s mounting hatred of not only Koresh but also the women and children sheltered within the compound. Reno, Chipman, and Sessions urged Clinton to swiftly resolve the protracted stalemate, arguing that his indecisiveness would empower future “domestic terrorists” and religious zealots to follow in Koresh’s footsteps. Reno pleaded with Clinton to “burn them out,” and both Chipman and Sessions, after expressing mild trepidations, agreed the situation had become untenable. Clinton gave them “carte blanche,” and encouraged them to eliminate “malcontents” as long as blame was assigned to Koresh and the U.S. government was held harmless for any fatalities.  “I don’t care what happens to them, they didn’t vote for me anyway,” Clinton said on the call. “If they die, they die. Just make sure the finger can’t be pointed back at us, or more importantly, me. Let’s nip this in the bud right now.”  As most know, on day 51 the FBI and ATF launched a siege on the Branch Davidian Compound. A fire consumed the facility, and 76 Branch Davidians, including Koresh, 25 children, and two pregnant women, were reduced to ashes. Janet Reno later claimed that Koresh had burned out his own people, even though video footage of government vehicles and personnel equipped with flamethrowers and other incendiary devices surfaced in pictures and video.  On a recorded telephone call captured three days after the siege, Clinton congratulated Reno, saying the Branch Davidians “got what they deserved.”  In GITMO’s south courtroom, Vice Adm. Hannink replayed the recording several times.  “This was not Hillary; this was all you. You were president, not your wife. Nowhere is she heard on these calls. No one here is saying Koresh was a nice guy. But you, detainee Clinton, ordered those deaths,” Vice Adm. Hannink said.  Kendall objected, claiming the tapes had not been entered into discovery and, thus, he had been given no opportunity to rebut their validity.  “I understand you were an accomplished civilian litigator, Mr. Kendall, but this is a military commission, operating under full force and effect of the insurrection act,” Vice Adm. Hannink replied.  Kendall altered his tone and calmly requested a 72-hour continuance, until Monday morning, to allow him to authenticate the tapes.  “Very well, this commission will grant you your 72 hours, but we’ll tolerate no further delays after this,” Vice Adm. Hannink said.  He put the tribunal in recess until ten hundred hours Monday morning.

a20087aa,"A major new allegation of voter fraud has been raised in Michigan, where a lawsuit filed by the Great Lakes Justice Center on behalf of two poll challengers says multiple levels of improper conduct took place on orders from election officials.  The allegations are aimed at election officials from Detroit and Wayne County, according to a release from the center, and are based on affidavits of named individuals who said they witnessed misconduct.  “This type of widespread fraud in the counting and processing of voter ballots cannot be allowed to stand. Michigan citizens are entitled to know that their elections are conducted in a fair and legal manner and that every legal vote is properly counted,” senior counsel David A. Kallman said in a statement.  “Such rampant fraud cannot be undone. We ask the Court to enjoin the certification of this fraudulent election, void the election, and order a new vote in Wayne County.”  Michigan, along with Pennsylvania, are two major states targeted by President Donald Trump’s campaign, which has alleged widespread voter fraud linked to mail-in ballots cast there.  TRENDING: Liberal Author Naomi Wolf: If I'd Known Biden Supports Lockdowns, 'I Never Would Have Voted for Him'  The lawsuit, filed by poll challengers Cheryl A. Costantino and Edward P. McCall Jr., cite what the legal filing calls “numerous issues of fraud and misconduct.”  The lawsuit seeks a temporary restraining order that would prohibit officials from certifying the vote until the charges made in the lawsuit can be investigated.  “Defendants systematically processed and counted ballots from voters whose name failed to appear in either the Qualified Voter File QVF or in the supplemental sheets. When a voter’s name could not be found, the election worker assigned the ballot to a random name already in the QVF to a person who had not voted,” the complaint reads.  “Defendants instructed election workers to not verify signatures on absentee ballots, to backdate absentee ballots, and to process such ballots regardless of their validity,” the complaint went on, adding another allegation that election workers were told “to process ballots that appeared after the election deadline and to falsely report that those ballots had been received prior to November 3, 2020 deadline.”  Do you believe vote fraud happened in Michigan?

There were tens of thousands of these absentee ballots, and apparently every ballot was counted and attributed only to Democratic candidates,” the complaint read.  “Unsecured ballots arrived at the TCF Center loading garage, not in sealed ballot boxes, without any chain of custody, and without envelopes.”  The complaint alleged that some ballots arrived in vehicles with out-of-state license plates, and that “[i]t was observed that all of these new ballots were cast for Joe Biden.”  The complaint went on to claim that election workers “systematically used false information to process ballots, such as using incorrect or false birthdays. Many times, the election workers inserted new names into the QVF after the election and recorded these new voters as having a birthdate of 1/1/1900.”  RELATED: Federal Investigators Arrive in Michigan After Viral Video Seems To Reveal Alleged Fraud  Oversight was denied, according to the complaint.  “Defendant election officials and workers refused to record challenges to their processes and removed challengers from the site if they politely voiced a challenge. After poll challengers started discovering the fraud taking place at the TCF Center, Defendant election officials and workers locked credentialed challengers out of the counting room so they could not observe the process, during which time tens of thousands of ballots were processed,” the complaint read.  “Defendant election officials and workers allowed ballots to be duplicated by hand without allowing poll challengers to check if the duplication was accurate. In fact, election officials and workers repeatedly obstructed poll challengers from observing. Defendants permitted thousands of ballots to be filled out by hand and duplicated on site without oversight from poll challengers.”  Detroit’s lawyer in the case said the lawsuit will go nowhere.  “Like two previous lawsuits, this case is not based upon actual evidence of any election fraud or misconduct, it is based upon various conspiracy theories, which have already been debunked,” David Fink told The Detroit News. “We are confident this case, like the others filed last week, will be dismissed.”  This article appeared originally on The Western Journal.","Lawsuit: Out-of-State Vehicles Brought Tens of Thousands of Unsealed Ballots to Michigan, All for Dems",false,
a5daf7ba,"It has been nearly three decades since the topic of global warming, and then climate change came on the scene as a hot (pardon the pun) topic on the pages and screens of our news media. Most people have taken sides as to whether or not humanity plays a role in determining the temperature of our planet. Whichever side you choose, it may not matter because the majority of the people will make the final decision. This decision making majority is not into the climate change debate for personal gains, political power, or social rewards. It is out of a genuine concern to do the right thing for humanity, their children, and all life on earth. Yet many are ambivalent, confused about the science or lack thereof to support one opinion or the other confidently. I believe that most are concerned with the least important factors rather than the most accurate answers. Let’s first establish that climate change is most definitely real. We all know that in the past, there were ice ages and wooly mammoths. We know about the heat of the dust bowl years of the 1930s pictured in the famous movie The Grapes of Wrath. Here I plan to give you the major vital factors that cause the climate to change. I choose to divide the controlling factors into four groups, leaving last those issues with which the reader is likely most familiar. The first group is related to the planetary orbit of the earth around the sun. The closer the earth is to the sun, the warmer it will be on earth. We learned in grade school that the earth is 93 million miles away, orbiting around it once a year. But this orbit is not always the same but is A very fresh look at climate change 1always changing. At times, the orbit is almost perfectly round; then, over thousands of years, it elongates and looks like a stretched out pancake, which we call an ellipse. Figure 1. About every 100,000 years, the sun makes a complete shift from this maximum elliptical shape when the earth goes as much as 120 million miles away to a near-perfect round shape. Then the earth is only 83 million miles away and it starts all over again, back to elliptical. This changing distance between the earth and the sun makes a big difference, which results in a change in our climate. Picture yourself at a campfire sitting 9 feet from the fire and then moving to a place 7 feet from the fire. That is the same ratio the earth experiences moving between 83 million miles and 120 million miles. The second factor that figures in the climate change story is the tilt of the earth relative to the sun. Presently this tilt is 23.7 degrees shown in Figure 2, but again things are always changing. The northern hemisphere of the earth will slowly tilt more towards the sun then slowly starts tilting back away from the sun. But after 40,000 years, it will be back to the tilt we see today. Within those 40,000 years, the tilt can range between 24.5 and 22.7 degrees. The tilt is significant as it determines winter, spring, summer, and fall and what their temperature ranges are likely to be. A very fresh look at climate changeThe third group of factors that impact the earth is contained within the sun itself. The sun undergoes very complicated and powerful magnetic cycles from high activity to low activity. It is easy to tell the difference from here on earth. When the activity is high, we see lots of spots on the sun. When we see few or even none, we know the activity levels are low, as can be solar radiation. Scientists have been carefully counting these spots for hundreds of years since Galileo got his first telescope. With satellites and advanced telescopes, NASA gets a count every day and also measures how big or small they are. As we see in Figure 3, scientists discovered without a question that these events go up and down in clear 11 year cycles. Believe it our not astronomers have recorded 24 such cycles in the past 250 years. Presently we are at the end of a cycle with near-zero sunspots. NASA has confirmed in recent years that increasing sunspots are linked to increases in earth temperature as well as the other planets, like Mars and Saturn, and even the moons. Essentially, none of the factors in these three groups are seriously considered in the alarmist views. They tell us that we are the primary forces controlling earth temperatures by the burning of fossil fuels and releasing their carbon dioxide. I hope my readers can recognize the absurdity of their claims. Now to the final group 4, the factors that logically and recognizably play a role in climate change. It is these variables that climate modelers try to use to create equations that supposedly tell us about how our climate will change for the coming decades. These factors are easy to understand but mostly impossible to predict. They include such things as the impact of clouds, the role of sea ice and glaciers, hurricanes and tornadoes, vegetation, the balance between the earth’s water, water vapor and ice, as well as the energy, flows between the oceans, the land, and the air. With these tools and methods, we can predict the weather for the next few days, maybe even weeks away. Surely they can’t predict the weather a year away, let alone decades into the future. I hope this short tutorial on the big climate change picture will make you more skeptical. After all, that’s the first responsibility of all real scientists, run experiments, gather data put together a theory then have as many experts try to shoot it down as best they can. The output of computer models is not data. Instead, these models are used to justify the nonsense they try to tell us that; life on earth will end in a dozen or so years along with their other ridiculous predictions for the future.",Charlie Crist disses idea of debate with Nan Rich,false,
,"Arthur Roberts, the 83-year-old C-List actor who portrays Joseph Biden on television and in person, blew his cover during a televised press conference with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier this week. In a stunning scene seen by many, Biden’s (RRN uses the term ‘Biden’ to stand for either Biden or his body doubles) handlers abruptly and seemingly without cause ushered the press pool from the White House Briefing Room while Johnson tried to field questions from British journalists in attendance.  The stunned press pool protested as security forcibly ejected them, clueless as to why they, the administration’s MSM allies, were being rudely told to leave.  On Wednesday, Jen Psaki, who is currently under military investigation, said the room was cleared because Johnson’s questions were not preapproved, but a whistleblower in the fake administration’s communications office revealed to RRN what actually transpired during the surreal briefing.  As reported previously, it is RRN’s contention that the real Joseph R. Biden has not been seen in public since shortly after the 2020 presidential election. The reason is that, in early February, he suffered a massive stroke that left him brain dead and hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he has lain comatose ever since. Biden’s Deep State handlers had had high hopes for Kamala Harris, and had intended that she would succeed him, but it soon became apparent that she lacked fortitude and the mental acuity needed to coalesce the liberal base. Much to her chagrin, she was put on the backburner while the Deep State sought body double replacements who could play a convincing Joe Biden.  One such find was Arthur Roberts, an obscure 80s actor whose capstone cinematic achievement was playing the evil ninja, Braden, in the 1984 martial arts flick Revenge of the Ninja. After that, he faded into obscurity, henceforth obtaining only minor roles in film and television productions, until the Deep State grabbed him as a potential Biden replacement in early March.  Roberts, no spring chicken himself and older than the genuine Biden, apparently has a touch of dementia, which caused him to veer off script and raise suspicion in the eyes of Boris Johnson.  In a moment not caught on microphone and spoken softly enough for the press pool to not overhear, Roberts began lamenting to Johnson his failed film career, and he asked the UK Prime Minister whether he had seen the films Little Miss Magic and Up in Smoke, in which he had minor roles.  A theatrically masked Boris Johnson, our source said, discretely muted his microphone and spoke softly in Roberts’ direction, asking, “You’re not Joe Biden. Who the bloody hell are you?”  “Even though he muted his mic, Jen Psaki and White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield were in another office, and able to overhear the entire discourse through hidden parabolic mics in the briefing room. They, how should I put this, freaked the fuck out. They began screaming into Roberts’ hidden earpiece to get back on script or read only from the teleprompter. That’s when Roberts silenced his own mic and told Boris he was only joking around. But Psaki feared the situation would deteriorate, and she immediately ordered the room cleared,” our source said.  He added that a bewildered Johnson later asked Psaki “what the hell just happened,” and was told to forget the entire incident, unless the UK wanted to lose all U.S. support.

d523eee3,"A belief in catastrophic man-made global warming should hinge on a couple of key factors. First, it must be shown that in the recent past the Earth was a cooler place. Second, temperatures in the present and in the future must show a dramatic increase in times of increased carbon dioxide. These facts would supply evidence that scientists could use to show that our planet is getting quickly warmer. Such a graph would look much like a hockey stick. But weather hasn’t always cooperated with the climate-alarmist version of events. And when temperatures don’t cooperate with climate hysteria, too often we find climate alarmists manipulating data. History — even recent history — gets changed to reflect what should be happening according to those “in the know.” Geologist Tony Heller, however, isn’t one to rely on what the mainstream media and climate scientists tell us is happening. Being a scientist, Heller is keen on reporting facts instead of hysteria. And Heller is telling us that global temperature data is being manipulated before our very eyes. According to Heller, NASA has manipulated historical temperature data to show a dramatic increase in temperature, especially since the year 2000. Comparing NASA charts from the years 2000, 2017, and 2019, Heller shows data has been manipulated multiple times since the year 2000. Heller shows, with NASA’s own data, that the space agency has been adjusting temperatures from the past — temperatures from as long ago as the mid-1800s — downward, while adjusting current-day temperatures upward, and those changes are responsible for most of the claimed global warming during that time. In the year 2000, historical data showed a .5 degree Celsius increase from the mid-1800s to the year 2000. In 2017, the same agency’s historical temperature data showed a 1.5C increase and just two years later a 2.0 C increase. In each of those time frames, older temperatures are pushed slightly downward. The 2017 to 2019 rise in temperature is especially confusing when you add the fact that satellite temperature data shows a global decrease in land temperature for the last two years. As well, satellite data adds to the case of fraud in another way: According to satellite data, since the year 2000, land temperatures have increased by .2 degrees Celsius, but NASA’s latest chart says that temperatures increased by 1.5 degrees Celsius since 2000. So more than 80 percent of the change in temperature since the year 2000 is the result of temperature data manipulation. “They’ve quadrupled warming mainly by cooling past temperatures and warming present temperatures,” Heller said in a video released on Monday. Moreover, the entire Medieval Warm Period has disappeared. The Medieval Warm Period, which has lots of scientific and historical evidence to show it happened — and which was prominent in a 1990 IPCC graph — has been adjusted out of existence. Climate alarmists can’t have a Medieval Warm Period, since it casts so much doubt on the current theory that man is causing a current upward temperature swing. The Medieval Warm Period occurred before man could reasonably be blamed for it. That’s why in 1999 when Michael Mann released his infamous “hockey stick graph,” the Medieval Warm Period was suddenly gone. Thus did Mann create a non-existent global-warming “tipping point” based on CO 2, starting in the late 19th century. “If we had high temperatures when CO 2 was low, that would indicate that other factors in the climate are much stronger than carbon dioxide,” Heller pointed out. The CO 2 tipping point farce goes beyond Michael Mann’s skullduggery. A 2006 statement by Dr. David Deming revealed that as early as 1995 scientists were facing pressure to “get rid of” the Medieval Warm Period. “I had another interesting experience around the time my paper in Science was published. I received an astonishing e-mail from a major researcher in the area of climate change. He said, “We have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period,” Deming told the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. (Interesting side note: When you click on the link to Deming’s 2002 testimony, the browser says, “Page cannot be found.” Question: Has it been purged, and if so, why?) “When you’re willing to manipulate data you can show any result you want, and they wanted to show warming,” Heller concluded. British economist Ronald Coase once quipped, “Torture the data, and it will confess to anything.” While Coase’s quote was about economics, it definitely applies to natural science as well. As Heller’s well-researched charts show, today’s climate-alarmist scientists are more than willing to “torture” the data to achieve their desired results. There are several examples of doctored historical temperature data. Besides NASA, we know that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has done it. We know that the HadCRUT 4 data used by the UNIPCC contained at least 70 obvious errors, according to a 2018 audit by climate-data researcher Dr. John Mclean. And the data tampering isn’t limited to temperature either. Sea-level rise data is tampered with as well. The willingness of scientists such as Mann and others to completely change historical data to show rapid warming is scientific quackery of the highest order. And that willingness doesn’t just make them bad scientists; it makes them liars.

,"A new NASA study, released on Friday, admits that ice is accumulating in Antarctica. Satellite measurements show an 82-112 gigaton-a-year net ice gain. That’s 82-112 billion tons per year! Nine zeroes! in other words that is 112,000,000,000 tons. Per year. It’s hard to comprehend how much ice that really is, so let’s put it in perspective. Let’s assume that they’re talking short tons (2,000 lbs). That’s about the weight of an old VW Beetle. Those old Beetles measured 14 feet long.  Multiply 112 billion by 14 feet and you get 1,560 billion feet. Divide that by the distance from the earth to the moon (239,000 miles),  and you’d have a string of VW Beetles stretching all the way to the moon. Not once, not twice, but 45 times.  All the way to the moon. That’s a helluva lot of new ice. Every single year. And we’re worried about global warming? Not only is the Antarctic Ice Sheet growing, NASA admits that the growth is actually reducing sea-level rise. This also confirms what I’ve been saying all along. Antarctica contains 90 percent of the earth’s ice. If the Antarctic Ice Sheet is growing, wouldn’t that mean that more than 90 percent of the world’s glaciers are growing? Here are excerpts, taken from NASA’s own website: “NASA – Antarctic Ice Sheet Is Growing” A new NASA study says that an increase in Antarctic snow accumulation that began 10,000 years ago is currently adding enough ice to the continent to outweigh the increased losses from its thinning glaciers. The research challenges the conclusions of other studies, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) 2013 report, which says that Antarctica is overall losing land ice. According to the new analysis of satellite data, the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net gain of 112 billion tons of ice a year from 1992 to 2001. That net gain slowed to 82 billion tons of ice per year between 2003 and 2008. “We’re essentially in agreement with other studies that show an increase in ice discharge in the Antarctic Peninsula and the Thwaites and Pine Island region of West Antarctica,” said Jay Zwally, a glaciologist with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and lead author of the study, which was published on Oct. 30 in the Journal of Glaciology. “Our main disagreement is for East Antarctica and the interior of West Antarctica – there, we see an ice gain that exceeds the losses in the other areas.”  Zwally added that his team “measured small height changes over large areas, as well as the large changes observed over smaller areas.” Scientists calculate how much the ice sheet is growing or shrinking from the changes in surface height that are measured by the satellite altimeters. In locations where the amount of new snowfall accumulating on an ice sheet is not equal to the ice flow downward and outward to the ocean, the surface height changes and the ice-sheet mass grows or shrinks. The study analyzed changes in the surface height of the Antarctic ice sheet measured by radar altimeters on two European Space Agency European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellites, spanning from 1992 to 2001, and by the laser altimeter on NASA’s Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) from 2003 to 2008. They also used information on snow accumulation for tens of thousands of years, derived by other scientists from ice cores, to conclude that East Antarctica has been thickening for a very long time. The extra snowfall that began 10,000 years ago has been slowly accumulating on the ice sheet and compacting into solid ice over millennia, thickening the ice in East Antarctica and the interior of West Antarctica by an average of 0.7 inches (1.7 centimeters) per year. “The good news is that Antarctica is not currently contributing to sea level rise, but is taking 0.23 millimeters per year away,” Zwally said.",Climate Shock: 90 Percent Of The World’s Glaciers Are GROWING,false,106661897367097985411022560344978077106
,"Records suggest more than 100 batches of absentee ballots in Fulton County could be missing. Some experts see ""election tabulation malpractice"" as state officials seek to remove county's top election supervisors.Documents that Georgia's largest county submitted to state officials as part of a post-election audit highlight significant irregularities in the Atlanta area during last November's voting, ranging from identical vote tallies repeated multiple times to large batches of absentee ballots that appear to be missing from the official ballot-scanning records. The problems in predominantly Democratic Fulton County potentially impact thousands of ballots in a presidential race that Joe Biden was certified as winning statewide by fewer than 12,000 votes. The memos reviewed by Just the News include the handwritten tally sheets for all absentee ballots counted by the county as well as a private report from a contractor hired by Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to monitor the Atlanta-area election process. The report, which chronicled seven days of problems, recorded troubling behavior like the mysterious removal of a suitcase of sensitive election data known as polls pads, used to authenticate voters. ""Learn that Rick reprogramming poll pads earlier was setting up a new precinct for SC11 because someone took the wrong suitcase but only took one,"" the contractor Seven Hills Strategy wrote late on Nov. 2, the night before Election Day. ""Seems to be a mystery who this person was --> Should have chain of custody paperwork!! That means that a stranger just walked out with sensitive election materials?"" The contractor also observed that sensitive election materials were left on a dock at a warehouse without supervision. ""Several cases (including SC11) were just left out on the loading dock outside the warehouse,"" he wrote. ""Thankfully the seals were intact."" File  SOS7HillStrategyFultonCountyNotes.pdf The revelations come as a state judge has taken the extraordinary step of ordering absentee ballots in the county unsealed so that a private audit led by lawyer Bob Cheeley can examine the actual papers and resolve discrepancies. Cheeley told Just the News on Wednesday the evidence he has seen so far points to ""election tabulation malpractice."" Private experts and state election officials differ on whether the evidence shows a pattern of potential fraud or simply gross incompetence in the county that encompasses Atlanta. But they are mostly united for the first time that the top election supervisors in Fulton County should be removed. Some officials are even discussing a dramatic intervention like putting the county's election system in conservatorship so it can be run by state, not local, officials. ""I have continued to call on the elections director to be removed from his position, and the leadership of Fulton County has continued to fail to act,"" Raffensperger told Just the News on Wednesday. The secretary said he stands by his private monitor's assessment that fraud did not occur at a scale in Fulton County to impact the election's outcome, but he added the county's election management failures nonetheless warrant dramatic repair. ""It is no secret that Fulton has had issues in their elections department for decades, which is why I insisted on a state monitor being present to be eyes and ears on the ground,"" he said. ""He did not see any evidence of fraud despite having full access, but he saw continued mismanagement, miscommunication, unpreparedness, and sloppiness. Georgia voters deserve better."" Fulton County election officials did not respond to repeated requests seeking comment. Just the News reviewed the documents Raffensperger's office collected from Fulton County during a risk-limiting audit conducted last November. Among the problems those memos exposed: More than 100 batches of absentee ballots — each containing approximately 100 or more ballots — were assigned tracking numbers before being sent to one of the five absentee vote-counting machines in Fulton County but are not subsequently recorded in the handwritten logs showing which batches were scanned and counted, raising concerns the ballots may be missing. More than two dozen batches of absentee ballots were identified as having been double-scanned on the tally sheets. Five sequential batches of absentee votes each appeared with the exact same vote count of 392 for Biden, 96 for President Donald Trump, and 3 for Libertarian Jo Jorgensen, a count that state officials admitted was a statistical impossibility. Many control sheets for absentee ballot batches counted during the state's audit did not check a box indicating the ballot came from a secure container, raising the possibility that ballots were stored insecurely or that multiple batches of ballots were sealed in a single container. An official working for Raffensperger, who reviewed the documents flagged by Just the News, said they were clear evidence of significant human failure in Fulton County's election administration. The official said, for instance, the identical ballot batches likely resulted in about 1,000 extra votes being tallied. File  batches1.pdf The official also said some of the gaps in the absentee ballots might be explained by mistakes in which county officials mixed absentee ballots counted by one machine for another. But he acknowledged other gaps in ballot batches defy immediate explanation and would require extensive investigation to determine if something more nefarious than incompetence was at work. A second state official said the shoddy nature of the Fulton County paperwork left open the possibility fraud or other misconduct occurred. ""An audit is only as good as the data that's input, and in this case Fulton County's records are so problematic I'm not sure a reasonable person can trust them,"" the official said. ""When you add in the reports of ballots magically appearing under tables or being moved out of the counting center, there are legitimate outstanding questions."" The findings of the Just the News review closely mirror those of the private audit conducted by Cheeley's team under the judge's supervision. A private fraud expert hired by Cheeley, the forensic accountant David Sawyer, specifically flagged scores of batches of absentee ballots that appeared missing from the documents and more than two dozen batches of absentee ballots that appear to have been double or triple-counted in Fulton County. Sawyer said the fact that ballot batch numbers are missing from the Fulton County audit documents ""contradicts the concepts of completeness and existence and accuracy"" of the November audit, and ""should have been readily apparent to anyone who is performing a reconciliation, let alone an audit."" ""These need to be more fully investigated, and they indicate the possibility that there are missing batches that might not have been counted,"" Sawyer testified. County lawyers who cross-examined Sawyer offered little explanation or pushback before the judge officially ordered all absentee ballots unsealed so Cheeley's team could investigate more deeply. That process is ongoing. Cheeley told Just the News on Wednesday night his ongoing audit has now flagged many thousands of absentee ballots that haven't been properly accounted or suffer other serious problems. ""Fulton County's inability to account for so many batches reported from a November hand recount audit amounts to election tabulation malpractice,"" he said. ""Anyone who can count should know that is unacceptable. This evidence produced in court on May 21 justified the audit which Judge Amero ordered of the absentee ballots and envelopes.""",Georgia audit documents expose significant election failures in state's largest county,false,258294010895719042557948678144972655244
,"On Election Night, early in the morning of November 4th, 2020, over 100,000 ballots were dropped for Joe Biden only.  What happened in Wisconsin on Election Night when over 100,000 ballots were dropped for Joe Biden only, giving him the lead in the state over President Trump who led the race up till that moment? This has never been explained.  Wisconsin was not alone.  TRENDING: Alec Baldwin's Negligent Discharge - Actor May Face Involuntary Manslaughter Charges  These events in Wisconsin on November 4th were neither random nor independent.  They were intentional fraud used to steal the election.  President Trump knows this as well as most of America. In May President Trump shared this message:  At 6:31 in the morning on November 4th, a dump of 149,772 votes came in to the State of Michigan. Biden received 96% of those votes and the State miraculously went to him. Has the Michigan State Senate started their review of the Fraudulent Presidential Election of 2020 yet, or are they about to start? If not, they should be run out of office. Likewise, at 3:42 in the morning, a dump of 143,379 votes came in to the state of Wisconsin, also miraculously, given to Biden. Where did these “votes” come from? Both were State Election changing events, and that is on top of the other corruption without even including the fact that neither state got Legislative approval, which is required under the United States Constitution.  Also, note something that we called HORSESH*T the day after the election. The state of Wisconsin have an 89% turnout in the election.  Umm. That didn’t happen.

dca71385,"Sharon Stone smoking in Basic Instinct  Every year, thousands of medical doctors and other members of the “Anti-Smoking Inquisition” spend billions of dollars perpetuating what has unquestionably become the most misleading though successful social engineering scam in history. With the encouragement of most western governments, these Orwellian lobbyists pursue smokers with a fanatical zeal that completely overshadows the ridiculous American alcohol prohibition debacle, which started in 1919 and lasted until 1933.  Nowadays we look back on American prohibition with justifiable astonishment. Is it really true that an entire nation allowed itself to be denied a beer or scotch by a tiny group of tambourine-bashing fanatics? Sadly, yes it is, despite a total lack of evidence that alcohol causes any harm to humans, unless consumed in truly astronomical quantities.  Although there is no direct link between alcohol and tobacco, the history of American prohibition is important, because it helps us understand how a tiny number of zealots managed to control the behavior and lives of tens of millions of people. Nowadays exactly the same thing is happening to smokers at the hands of government zealots and ignorant medical practitioners.  Certain governments know that their past actions are directly responsible for causing most of the lung and skin cancers in the world today, so they go to extreme lengths in trying to deflect responsibility and thus financial liability away from themselves, and onto harmless organic tobacco instead. As we will find later in the report, humble organic tobacco has never hurt anyone, and in certain ways can justifiably claim to provide startling health protection.  Not all governments around the world share the same problem. Japan and Greece have the highest numbers of adult cigarette smokers in the world, but the lowest incidence of lung cancer. In direct contrast to this, America, Australia, Russia, and some South Pacific island groups have the lowest numbers of adult cigarette smokers in the world, but the highest incidence of lung cancer. This is clue number-one in unraveling the absurd but entrenched western medical lie that “smoking causes lung cancer.”  The first European contact with tobacco was in 1492, when Columbus and fellow explorer Rodriguo de Jerez saw natives smoking in Cuba. That very same day, de Jerez took his first puff and found it very relaxing, just as the locals had assured him it would be. This was an important occasion, because Rodriguo de Jerez discovered what the Cubans and native Americans had known for many centuries: that cigar and cigarette smoking is not only relaxing, it also cures coughs and other minor ailments. When he returned home, Rodriguo de Jerez proudly lit a cigar in the street, and was promptly arrested and imprisoned for three years by the horrified Spanish Inquisition. De Jerez thus became the first victim of the anti-smoking lobbies.  In less than a century, smoking became a much enjoyed and accepted social habit throughout Europe, with thousands of tons of tobacco being imported from the colonies to meet the increasing demand. A growing number of writers praised tobacco as a universal remedy for mankind’s ills. By the early 20th Century almost one in every two people smoked, but the incidence of lung cancer remained so low that it was almost immeasurable. Then something extraordinary happened on July 16, 1945: a terrifying cataclysmic event that would eventually cause western governments to distort the perception of smoking forever. As K. Greisen recalls:  “When the intensity of the light had diminished, I put away the glass and looked toward the tower directly. At about this time I noticed a blue color surrounding the smoke cloud. Then someone shouted that we should observe the shock wave travelling along the ground. The appearance of this was a brightly lighted circular area, near the ground, slowly spreading out towards us. The color was yellow.”  “The permanence of the smoke cloud was one thing that surprised me. After the first rapid explosion, the lower part of the cloud seemed to assume a fixed shape and to remain hanging motionless in the air. The upper part meanwhile continued to rise, so that after a few minutes it was at least five miles high. It slowly assumed a zigzag shape because of the changing wind velocity at different altitudes. The smoke had pierced a cloud early in its ascent, and seemed to be completely unaffected by the cloud.”  This was the notorious “Trinity Test”, the first dirty nuclear weapon to be detonated in the atmosphere. A six-kilogram sphere of plutonium, compressed to supercriticality by explosive lenses, Trinity exploded over New Mexico with a force equal to approximately 20,000 tons of TNT. Within seconds, billions of deadly radioactive particles were sucked into the atmosphere to an altitude of six miles, where high-speed jet streams could circulate them far and wide.  The American Government knew about the radiation in advance, was well aware of its lethal effects on humans, but bluntly ordered the test with a complete disregard for health and welfare. In law, this was culpable gross negligence, but the American Government did not care. Sooner or later, one way or the other, they would find another culprit for any long-term effects suffered by Americans and other citizens in local and more remote areas.  If a single microscopic radioactive fallout particle lands on your skin at the beach, you get skin cancer. Inhale a single particle of the same lethal muck, and death from lung cancer becomes inevitable, unless you happen to be an exceptionally lucky cigarette smoker. The solid microscopic radioactive particle buries itself deep in the lung tissue, completely overwhelms the body’s limited reserves of vitamin B17, and causes rampant uncontrollable cell multiplication.  How can we be absolutely sure that radioactive fallout particles really cause lung cancer every time a subject is internally exposed? For real scientists, as opposed to medical quacks and government propagandists, this is not a problem. For any theory to be accepted scientifically, it must first be proven in accordance with rigorous requirements universally agreed by scientists. First the suspect radioactive agent must be isolated, then used in properly controlled laboratory experiments to produce the claimed result, i.e. lung cancer in mammals.  Scientists have ruthlessly sacrificed tens of thousands of mice and rats in this way over the years, deliberately subjecting their lungs to radioactive matter. The documented scientific results of these various experiments are identical. Every mouse or rat obediently contracts lung cancer, and every mouse or rat then dies. Theory has thus been converted to hard scientific fact under tightly controlled laboratory conditions. The suspect agent [radioactive matter] caused the claimed result [lung cancer] when inhaled by mammals.  The overall magnitude of lung cancer risk to humans from atmospheric radioactive fallout cannot be overstated. Before Russia, Britain and America outlawed atmospheric testing on August 5, 1963, more than 4,200 kilograms of plutonium had been discharged into the atmosphere. Because we know that less than one microgram [millionth of a single gram] of inhaled plutonium causes terminal lung cancer in a human, we therefore know that your friendly government has lofted 4,200,000,000 [4.2 Billion] lethal doses into the atmosphere, with particle radioactive half-life a minimum of 50,000 years. Frightening? Unfortunately it gets worse.  The plutonium mentioned above exists in the actual nuclear weapon before detonation, but by far the greatest number of deadly radioactive particles are those derived from common dirt or sand sucked up from the ground, and irradiated while travelling vertically through the weapon’s fireball. These particles form by far the largest part of the “smoke” in any photo of an atmospheric nuclear detonation. In most cases several tons of material are sucked up and permanently irradiated in transit, but let us be incredibly conservative and claim that only 1,000 kilograms of surface material is sucked up by each individual atmospheric nuclear test.  Before being banned by Russia, Britain and America, a total of 711 atmospheric nuclear tests were conducted, thereby creating 711,000 kilograms of deadly microscopic radioactive particles, to which must be added the original 4,200 kilograms from the weapons themselves, for a gross though very conservative total of 715,200 kilograms. There are more than a million lethal doses per kilogram, meaning that your governments have contaminated your atmosphere with more than 715,000,000,000 [715 Billion] such doses, enough to cause lung or skin cancer 117 times in every man, woman and child on earth.  Before you ask, no, the radioactive particles do not just “fade away”, at least not in your lifetime or that of your children and grandchildren. With a half-life of 50,000 years or longer, these countless trillions of deadly government-manufactured radioactive particles are essentially with you forever. Circulated around the world by powerful jet streams, these particles are deposited at random, though in higher concentrations within a couple of thousand miles of the original test sites. A simple wind or other surface disturbance is all that is needed to stir them up again and create enhanced dangers for those in the vicinity.  The once-innocent activity of playfully kicking sand around on the beach in summer could nowadays easily translate to suicide, if you happen to stir up a few radioactive particles that could stick to your skin or be inhaled into your lungs.  Twelve years after the cataclysmic Trinity test, it became obvious to western governments that things were getting completely out of control, with a 1957 British Medical Research Council report stating that global “deaths from lung cancer have more than doubled during the period 1945 to 1955”, though no explanation was offered. During the same ten-year period, cancer deaths in the immediate proximity of Hiroshima and Nagasaki went up threefold. By the end of official atmospheric testing in 1963, the incidence of lung cancer in the Pacific Islands had increased fivefold since 1945. Having screwed your environment completely for 50,000 years, it was time for “big government” to start taking heavy diversionary action.  How could people be proved to be causing themselves to contract lung cancer, i.e. be said to be guilty of a self inflicted injury for which government could never be blamed or sued? The only obvious substance that people inhaled into their lungs, apart from air, was tobacco smoke, so the government boot was put in. Poorly qualified medical “researchers” suddenly found themselves overwhelmed with massive government grants all aimed at achieving the same end-result: “Prove that smoking causes lung cancer”. Real scientists especially some notable nuclear physicists smiled grimly at the early pathetic efforts of the fledgling anti-smoking lobby, and lured them into the deadliest trap of all. The quasi-medical researchers were invited to prove their false claims under exactly the same rigid scientific rules that were used when proving that radioactive particles cause lung cancer in mammals.  Remember, for any theory to be accepted scientifically, it must first be proven in accordance with rigorous requirements universally agreed by scientists. First the suspect agent tobacco smoke must be isolated, then used in properly controlled laboratory experiments to produce the claimed result, i.e. lung cancer in mammals. Despite exposing literally tens of thousands of especially vulnerable mice and rats to the equivalent of 200 cigarettes per day for years on end, “medical science” has never once managed to induce lung cancer in any mouse or rat. Yes, you did read that correctly. For more than forty years, hundreds of thousands of medical doctors have been deliberately lying to you.  The real scientists had the quasi-medical researchers by the throat, because “pairing” the deadly radioactive particle experiment with the benign tobacco smoke experiment, proved conclusively for all time that smoking cannot under any circumstances cause lung cancer. And further, in one large “accidental” experiment they were never allowed to publish, the real scientists proved with startling clarity that smoking actually helps to protect against lung cancer.  All mice and rats are used one-time-only in a specific experiment, and then destroyed. In this way researchers ensure that the results of whatever substance they are testing cannot be accidentally “contaminated” by the real or imagined effects of another substance. Then one day as if by magic, a few thousand mice from the smoking experiment “accidentally” found their way into the radioactive particle experiment, which in the past had killed every single one of its unfortunate test subjects. But this time, completely against the odds, sixty percent of the smoking mice survived exposure to the radioactive particles. The only variable was their prior exposure to copious quantities of tobacco smoke.  Government pressure was immediately brought to bear and the facts suppressed, but this did not completely silence the real scientists. Tongue-in-cheek perhaps, Professor Schrauzer, President of the International Association of Bio-inorganic Chemists, testified before a U.S. congressional committee in 1982 that it had long been well known to scientists that certain constituents of tobacco smoke act as anti-carcinogens anti-cancer agents in test animals. He continued that when known carcinogens cancer-causing substances are applied to the animals, the application of constituents of cigarette smoke counter them.  Nor did Professor Schrauzer stop there. He further testified on oath to the committee that “no ingredient of cigarette smoke has been shown to cause human lung cancer”, adding that “no-one has been able to produce lung cancer in laboratory animals from smoking.” It was a neat answer to a rather perplexing problem. If government blocks publication of your scientific paper, take the alternate route and put the essential facts on the written congressional record!  Predictably, this hard truth drove the government and quasi-medical “researchers” into a frenzy of rage. By 1982 they had actually started to believe their own ridiculous propaganda, and were not to be silenced by eminent members of the scientific establishment. Quite suddenly they switched the blame to other “secret” ingredients put into cigarettes by the tobacco companies. “Yes, that must be it!” they clamored eagerly, until a handful of scientists got on the phone and pointed out that these same “secret” ingredients had been included in the mice experiments, and had therefore also been proved incapable of causing lung cancer.  Things were looking desperate for government and the medical community overall. Since the anti-smoking funding had started in the early sixties, tens of thousands of medical doctors had passed through medical school, where they had been taught that smoking causes lung cancer. Most believed the lie, but cracks were starting to appear in the paintwork. Even the dullest of straight “C” doctors could not really make the data correlate, and when they queried it were told not to ask stupid questions. “Smoking causes lung cancer” converted to a creed, a quasi-religious belief mechanism where blind faith became a substitute for proof.  On the mortuary slab the lungs of a smoker and non-smoker look an identical pink, and the only way a forensic pathologist can tell you might have been a smoker, is if he finds heavy stains of nicotine on your fingers, a packet of Camels or Marlboro in your coat pocket, or if one of your relatives unwisely admits on the record that you once smoked the demon weed. Even blind faith needs a system of positive reinforcement, which in this case became the advertising agencies and the media. Suddenly the television screens were flooded with images of terribly blackened “smoker’s lungs”, with the accompanying mantra that you will die in horrible agony if you don’t quit now. It was all pathetic rubbish of course.and the only way a forensic pathologist can tell you might have been a smoker, is if he finds heavy stains of nicotine on your fingers, a packet of Camels or Marlboro in your coat pocket, or if one of your relatives unwisely admits on the record that you once smoked the demon weed.  The black lungs? From a coal miner, who throughout his working life breathed in copious quantities of microscopic black coal dust particles. Just like radioactive particles they get caught deep in the tissue of the lungs and stay there forever.  Many people ask exactly how it is that those smoking mice were protected from deadly radioactive particles, and even more are asking why real figures nowadays are showing far more non-smokers dying from lung cancer than smokers. Professor Sterling of the Simon Fraser University in Canada is perhaps closest to the truth, where he uses research papers to reason that smoking promotes the formation of a thin mucous layer in the lungs, “which forms a protective layer stopping any cancer-carrying particles from entering the lung tissue.”  This is probably as close as we can get to the truth at present, and it does make perfect scientific sense. Deadly radioactive particles inhaled by a smoker would initially be trapped by the mucous layer, and then be ejected from the body before they could enter the tissue.  All of this may be a bit depressing for non-smokers, but there are probably one or two things you can do to minimize the risks as far as possible. Rather than shy away from smokers in your local pub or club, get as close as you can and breathe in their expensive second-hand smoke. Go on, don’t be shy, suck in a few giant breaths. Or perhaps you could smoke one cigarette or small cigar after each meal, just three a day to build up a thin boundary mucous layer. If you cannot or will not do either of the above, consider getting a surgical mask!  .",SHOCKING REPORT: Smoking May Protect Lungs From Cancer,false,

5dc31757,"New Mexico lawmakers are swiftly on their way toward legalizing the killing of unborn babies in abortions up to birth for years to come.  The Daily Post reports the state Health and Human Services Committee passed House Bill 7 with bipartisan support on Wednesday. The vote was 8-3, and the bill now heads to the state House Judiciary Committee.  The pro-abortion bill would repeal a 1969 statute that prohibits abortions except in cases of rape, incest or threats to the mother’s life. The statute is not in effect because of Roe v. Wade, but if it is repealed, the state would continue to allow unborn babies to be aborted for any reason up to birth even if Roe is overturned.  It also would repeal the only conscience protections for pro-life medical workers in New Mexico. Currently, the law protects doctors, nurses and other medical workers from discrimination if they refuse to abort an unborn baby based on “moral or religious grounds.”  A state Senate committee passed an almost identical bill earlier this week.  However, pro-life leaders and medical workers are pushing back, saying the bill would strip away vital protections for healthcare workers, babies and mothers.  “Regardless of your position on abortion, no one should be forced to participate, to violate her most deeply held principles or the reason she entered the medical field – to save lives,” Catherine Glenn Foster, president of Americans United for Life, told the committee prior to the vote.  Foster said tens of thousands of healthcare providers in New Mexico would lose their conscience rights and they could sue the state for violating their religious freedom.  During a Senate hearing earlier in the week, state Sen. Gregg Schmedes, R-Sandoval, warned that doctors may leave New Mexico if the bill passes.  “Though some of the existing law is unenforceable because of Roe v. Wade, this statute contains important provisions that protect our doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals,” Schmedes said, according to the Los Alamos Reporter. “As a medical doctor, I have heard from many of my colleagues that if they lose these vital conscience protections, they will consider leaving the state which would threaten healthcare access for many New Mexicans.”  But state Rep. Micaela Lara Cadena, D-Mesilla, a sponsor of the bill, argued that the 1969 statute needs to be repealed because it is “outdated and dangerous.”  “Pregnant people and their families deserve continued access to safe and legal abortion,” Cadena said. “By repealing this dangerous statute, we are making sure this ban is never enforceable in New Mexico again.”  The AP predicts the bill will pass the Democrat-controlled state legislature. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a pro-abortion Democrat, also supports it.  But pro-lifers are not giving up hope. Elisa Martinez, executive director of the New Mexico Alliance for Life, urged New Mexico residents to call their lawmakers and urge them to reject the bill.  “The radical abortion lobby seeks to force medical professionals across New Mexico to perform abortions as a matter of ‘access.’ This is not a pro-woman bill but rather, a pro-abortion lobby bill,” Martinez said.  In 2019, a bipartisan group of lawmakers defeated a similar pro-abortion bill in the state Senate. However, many of the Democrat lawmakers who voted against it no longer serve in the legislature.  The bill is similar to laws that passed recently in New York, Vermont, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. New Jersey also is considering a bill to expand the killing of unborn babies in abortions this year.

Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice  Conspiracists are bizarrely claiming the UK could be hit harder by coronavirus because of the rollout of the 5G network, a claim that has been dismissed by scientists.  Currently there are 3,983 confirmed cases of Covid-19 across Britain and Northern Ireland.  As coronavirus has ripped across the globe, a new conspiracy theory has found an eager audience: that the symptoms of the virus - high fever, coughing and shortness of breath - are actually the human body responding to exposure to 5G.  The theory has been shot down by experts, who have pointed out that coronavirus cases have been identified in many areas with no 5G networks.  Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto  Anti-5G critics based in the UK accept the virus likely began in a market in Wuhan and travelled here through human transmission. But they bizarrely believe the 5G networks helps the spread of the virus.  But they're concerned the ultra-fast network currently operating in almost 100 locations around Britain could be helping it to spread more quickly, despite a lack of scientific proof to stand up their unfounded claims.  Activist Louise Thomas, based in Somerset, told Daily Star Online: We can't say 5G has caused the coronavirus, but it might be exacerbating it.  Tanja Rebel, another activist and philosophy lecturer at the Isle of Wight College, told us: Many studies show that Electro-Magnetic Radiation EMR suppresses the immune system and that it helps viruses and bacteria thrive.  So EMR and in particular 5G could act as an accelerator for the disease. We do not know for sure, but common sense and the precautionary principle decree that we urgently need a moratorium on the roll-out of 5G until we can show that it is safe.  Public Health England PHE has publicly stated there is no convincing evidence that exposure to radiation at a level below the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation guidelines will cause adverse health effects.  That safe level is 300GHz, while the level of radiation from 5G will likely only be as high as the tens of GHz.  PHE has been approached for comment on these specific claims from activists.  The new 5G network is being rolled out incrementally across the UK  The “precautionary principle” says that governments and societies should react with caution to anything with the potential to cause catastrophic damage which is not yet well-understood by science.  Italy, now the country with the highest coronavirus death toll, had 5G networks installed in five cities in 2019 with plans to extend coverage throughout 2020. However Iran, which has also been badly affected by the pandemic, has no 5G networks at all, disputing this theory.  A 2011 study from Northeastern University in Boston indicated that some single-celled bacteria, such as E.coli, may communicate with each other using radio waves.  Very little is known about Covid-19, the novel coronavirus at the heart of the current pandemic, but research has shown that viruses talk to each other when making decisions about infecting a host.  Activists are now calling for the government to put a stop to the 5G rollout in what they believe to be the interests of public health, despite repeated assurances from experts that the network radiation poses no threat.  Especially in today's situation it is paramount that we do not play further with lives, Rebel said. Anything else would be deeply reckless.  There have been reports of 5G masts being vandalised and telecoms engineers harassed by member of the public who believe the coronavirus conspiracy theory.  Communications regulator Ofcom has warned this behaviour poses a serious threat to people's safety, adding: We would like to emphasise that there is no relationship whatsoever between 5G mobile signals and the coronavirus.  Vandalism to mobile phone masts mean other services using those masts stop working. These services could include 3G, 4G and mobile call services.  This means people can't call the emergency services or contact their family. It could also mean that some of the communications equipment used by the emergency services is unable to work properly.

83f8a888,"Democrat spokesperson, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, continues to push her socialist agenda and now it’s getting downright scary. Her latest genius plan is to socialize our children. That’s right, apparently AOC feels that upon birth, the offspring of American families should be taken from their homes to be raised by the state “so that they can do properly indoctrinated and become model citizens for a new and better American future.”  This is straight out of the Soviet playbook where children were routinely removed from households and molded into various roles for government. They were treated as possessions, not people, while families mourned.  AOC suggested this when asked her thoughts on the plight of orphaned children throughout the country, currently at 50 year high.  “Our children are underused in this country. Or rather, improperly used. They say children are the future. That is absolutely right. They hold the promise to shape the future of our nation. This can be positive or negative. Orphans are in the right place. Government can begin their training early. All kids should go to government. By staying with family, children are fed varieties of information. There’s no consistency from one household to the next. This is counterproductive to the societal good. In order to further the interests of the country and all it’s citizens, there needs to be common learning amongst all of the young. Child rearing taken over by the state can accomplish this while also providing a safe and healthy environment in which to grow. Surrendering your children to the state is really the highest form of patriotism there can be. It shows you love our country and are committed to building its success for generations to come.”  If another reason was ever needed to join the fight against socialism, this is it. A system that would destroy families by taking away their children is not one that is consistent with American values. Don’t let it happen here.",AOC:’Children Should Be Raised By The State’,false,
,"By Mary Fanning and Alan Jones | January 11, 2021  Raw data analytics exclusively obtained by The American Report show that during the 2020 presidential election internet protocol (IP) addresses in China, Russia, Hong Kong, Germany, Canada, and the Czech Republic hacked into IP addresses in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Nevada, Michigan and Georgia.  IP addresses owned by Chinese telecom enterprise Huawei Cloud and Huawei’s headquarters hacked into IP addresses in Pennsylvania on November 3, 2020, the data analysis shows. A Huawei-owned IP address also hacked an IP address in Michigan.  IP addresses owned by Chinese state-owned telecommunications operator China Unicom also hacked into IP addresses in Pennsylvania on November 3.  IP addresses owned by Chinese internet provider ChinaNet hacked into IP addresses in Nevada on November 3, according to the data analysis.  Aliyun Computing Co. owns several IP addresses that hacked into IP addresses in Michigan on November 3, the data analysis shows. Aliyun, also known as Alibaba Cloud, “is the cloud computing unit of Alibaba Group,” according to TechCrunch.  Alibaba founder Jack Ma has not been seen for weeks.  Image: Alibaba founder Jack Ma (image credit Wikimedia Commons / World Economic Forum)  An IP address owned by Kaspersky Lab – Moscow hacked into an IP address in Michigan on November 3, according to the data analysis. Kaspersky is a Russian software and cybersecurity firm. Kasperky Lab was co-founded by Eugene Kaspersky and his now-ex-wife, Natalya Kaspersky.  Image: Eugene Kaspersky (L) and Natalya Kaspersky (R)  Eugene Kasperky, the CEO of Kaspersky Lab, served in the Soviet military intelligence service and is a graduate of The Technical Faculty of the KGB Higher School, now known as Institute of Cryptography, Telecommunications and Computer Science, part of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, widely known as the FSB.  Natalya Kaspersky is now the CEO of Russia’s InfoWatch Group and has a reported net worth of $270 million. “Natalya Kaspersky’s Snoop-Proof Phone Helps Putin Thwart Spies,” according to Bloomberg.  President Trump banned Kaspersky from all U.S. government networks when he signed the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). “The ban, included as part of a broader defense policy spending bill that Trump signed, reinforces a directive issued by the Trump administration in September that civilian agencies remove Kaspersky Lab software within 90 days,” Reuters reported on December 12, 2017. “The law applies to both civilian and military networks.” U.S. District Court Judge for the U.S. District of the District of Columbia Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, former Presiding Judge of the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court), upheld President Trump’s ban after Kaspersky Labs sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  “Christopher Krebs, a senior cyber security official at the Department of Homeland Security, told reporters that nearly all government agencies had fully removed Kaspersky products from their networks in compliance with the September order,” according to the Reuters report. President Trump “terminated” Krebs in mid-November 2020 after Krebs claimed the 2020 election was the most secure election in history.  An IP address owned by the University of Stuttgart, a research university in Germany, also hacked into an IP address in Michigan on November 3, according to the analysis.  Amazon Data Services in Toronto, Canada owns an IP address that hacked into a Michigan IP address on November 3, according to the analysis.  Dominion Voting Services is based in Toronto. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a major provider of cloud services for U.S. elections.  “Scytl products and services are hosted on Amazon Web Services,” according to Scytl.  IP addresses owned by Seznam, a search engine based in the Czech Republic, as well as an IP address owned by O2 Czech Republic, a Czech company offering mobile communications and internet access services, hacked into IP addresses in Michigan on November 3, the analysis shows.  China’s Shanghai UCloud Information Technology Company Limited owns an IP address that hacked into a Michigan IP address on November 3, according to the data analysis.

Liz Truss erupts at EU  Joining one of the world’s largest free trade areas would ultimately trigger major tariff cuts in industries such as food, drink, cars and tech.  Additionally, the UK would form closer alliances with 11 current members including Australia, Canada, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore.  In a report for the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), Conservative MP Anthony Mangnall points out that membership could see the proportion of UK exports eligible for tariff-free access rising from 85.4% to 99.9%, with the potential to boost GDP by up to £20billion a year if the US joined the CPTPP before the UK managed to agree a bilateral FTA with Washington.  “CPTPP offers a huge opportunity for Britain,” he writes. “The benefits of joining are clear – an economic boost to the whole of the UK, geo-political support to our allies and the development and standardisation of global trade rules.  “Our membership to CPTPP does not reduce our high standards or strip away our sovereignty [but] seeks to raise standards and provides a platform for the UK to play a leading role in shaping the future of trade.”  Foreign Secretary Liz Truss made becoming a member of the CPTPP a key priority for the UK in her previous role as International Trade Secretary.

,"Written by James Edward Kamis on Aug 7, 2018 . Posted in Latest news  In what amounts to dissension from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) climate change policy, a series of just-released studies by working-level scientists prove that geological and not atmospheric forces are responsible for melting of Earth’s polar ice sheets.  A review of these studies and their significance relative to what force or forces control the climate and climate-related events of Earth’s polar regions is as follows.  NASA Antarctica Study October 30, 2015  This research study authored by NASA Glaciologist Jay Zwally concluded that Antarctica is gaining, not losing, ice mass and thereby challenging the conclusions of many previous studies, most importantly the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) 2013 report (see the quote from the study below).  “A new NASA study says that an increase in Antarctic snow accumulation that began 10,000 years ago is currently adding enough ice to the continent to outweigh the increased losses from its thinning glaciers.  “The research challenges the conclusions of other studies, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) 2013 report, which says that Antarctica is overall losing land ice.  The conclusions of this NASA study were immediately challenged by numerous climate activist groups and biased media outlets (see here). These challenges have since been proven incorrect for several reasons.  Statements by NASA Glaciologist Jay Zwally concerning his soon-to-be-published Antarctic follow-up study reconfirm that Antarctica is gaining, not losing ice.  The results of this follow-up study are bolstered by two other NASA research studies.  The first, dated January 1, 2018, shows that East Antarctica has for many years been accumulating huge amounts of snow that compact into ice and increasing overall ice mass (see here).  The second NASA study released on July 19, 2018, showed that the atmosphere above the Antarctic Continent has been continuously cooling and not warming for many years (see here).  Obviously, it’s impossible to melt Antarctica’s glaciers via atmospheric warming when the atmosphere is not warming.  Lastly, a NASA study dated Feb. 20, 2018, concludes that outflow of East Antarctic glaciers into the ocean is stable and not increasing (see here). This is proof that East Antarctica’s ice mass is not being diminished by glacial outflow into adjacent oceans.  Bottom line, research by NASA scientists clearly shows that the well-documented ice loss in West Antarctica is more than accommodated by ice gains in East Antarctica. Contrary to hundreds of pro-melting articles, Antarctica’s ice mass is increasing!  NASA Antarctica Study November 7, 2017  This research study entitled “Hot News from the Antarctic Underground“ investigated West Antarctica’s subglacial geology.  It substantiates many previous research studies that have documented this region’s subglacial high-bedrock heat-flow, active faulting, and prevalent volcanism.  Recent research by the University of Rhode Island scientists confirms the premises of a previous Climate Change Dispatch article that subglacial, volcanic heat-flow is melting West Antarctica’s Pine Island Glacier (see here).  Many previous Climate Change Dispatch articles have reviewed West Antarctica’s subglacial mantle plume and the world-class fault system that is acting to bottom-melt this region’s glacial land sea ice (see here, here, and here).  NASA Greenland Study August 1, 2018  The results of this research study illustrated in Figure 2 confirm the very high geothermal bedrock heat-flow from Greenland’s massive subglacial Mantle Plume, which was originally documented in four previous research studies (see here, here, here, and here).  A geothermal heat-flow cause for the melting of Greenland’s ice sheet has been the focus of numerous Climate Change Dispatch articles (see here, here, here, and here).  In summary, the NASA studies mentioned in this article have accelerated the ongoing demise of the once one-hundred-percent-settled-science status of global warming theory.  It is now abundantly clear that even respected mainstream NASA geologists and glaciologists are advocating that formerly underappreciated geological forces working in concert with atmospheric forces are responsible for polar ice cap melting.  Here we note that in many cases these geological forces are dominant and, in some cases, the complete cause of modern-day and ancient polar ice cap melting  Knowing this brings into question other aspects of supposedly 100 percent settled climate dogma.  Specifically, that man-made global warming is the root cause of other supposedly unnatural polar ice cap events such as alteration of marine and land animal migration patterns, anomalous plankton blooms, chemical alteration of adjacent ocean waters, alteration of polar area ocean currents, and changes in meteorological patterns.  Many of these events are more likely the result of, or strongly influenced by, geologically induced heat and chemically charged heated fluid flow at the base of polar ice sheets or in adjacent oceans.  Lastly, there is a quiet revolution occurring within NASA that will play out within the next year or two ending in the complete reconstruction of global warming theory.  The remodeled version will reflect the now proven and significant climate influence of geological forces as per the 2014 Plate Climatology Theory.  James Edward Kamis is a retired professional Geologist with 42 years of experience, a B.S. in Geology from Northern Illinois University (1973), an M.S. in geology from Idaho State University (1977), and a longtime member of AAPG who has always been fascinated by the connection between Geology and Climate. More than 14 years of research/observation have convinced him that the Earth’s Heat Flow Engine, which drives the outer crustal plates, is an important driver of the Earth’s climate as per his Plate Climatology Theory .

,"Are you one of those people hesitant to receive a COVID-19 vaccine? You know, one of those “dangerous” and “selfish” people, as the Democrats would call you, who is foolish for not getting the jab because, after all, it’s completely safe?  Well, the CDC has quietly released data that might prove you’re not that foolish after all.  The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) posted data which shows that more people have died after receiving a COVID vaccine than for all other vaccines of the last 20 years combined.  According to the CDC website: “Over 245 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from Dec. 14, 2020, through May 3, 2021. During this time, VAERS received 4,178 reports of death (0.0017%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. CDC and FDA physicians review each case report of death as soon as notified and CDC requests medical records to further assess reports.”  A “review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines,” according to their website. This is critical medical editorializing in order to avoid scaring people. The CDC has a vested interest in getting as many people vaccinated as possible, so they buried the crucial data about deaths at the bottom of a page meant to assuage concerns about these experimental drugs with the explicit intent of forcing people to take it.  Of course, vaccine apprehension is nothing new. Tucker Carlson has been raising legitimate concerns for quite a while now.  One of his latest segments on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” Carlson asked a very important question:  “How many Americans have died after taking the COVID vaccines? Not Americans who’ve been killed by the virus, that’s a huge number, but how many Americans have died after getting the vaccines designed to prevent the virus? Do you know the answer to that question? Do you know anything about the downside? We know a lot about the upside of the vaccine. We’ve been completely in favor of vulnerable people taking vaccines.”  Carlson’s segment was, predictably, banned from YouTube for simply questioning vaccine safety. People, however, have been sharing recordings online.  Before Big Tech takes it down again, check out the video below:  On this occasion, full marks to Fox News, but it is obviously an exception.  Carlson makes the point that in 4 months of Covid ""vaccines"", the 3,000+ deaths is greater than with all other vaccines in the previous 15 years. No official investigation!https://t.co/iebMBd30eF — Dr Verner Wheelock (@VernersViews) May 6, 2021  People don’t usually associate vaccines with serious side effects, let alone deaths, because vaccines are, on the whole, not dangerous, at least according to the numbers. Every year, about 160 million Americans get the flu shot, including myself, so I’m clearly not an “anti-vaxxer”. I just have a few questions about the COVID vaccine that I can’t seem to find answers to.  Tucker said, “Every year, a relatively small number of people seem to die after getting those shots. To be precise, in 2019, that number was 203 people. The year before, it was 119. In 2017, a total of 85 people died from the flu shot.”  Out of 160 million people who get the flu shot, those numbers of people who died, every one of them being tragic to their loved ones, aren’t significant enough for the rest of us to consider not getting the flu shot.  Carlson wanted to know how many people have died from getting the COVID vaccine:  “We checked today. Here’s the answer, which comes from the same set of government numbers that we just listed: Between late December of 2020, and last month, a total of 3,362 people apparently died after getting the COVID vaccines in the United States. Three thousand, three hundred and sixty-two — that’s an average of 30 people every day. So, what does that add up to? By the way, that reporting period ended on April 23. We don’t have numbers past that, we’re not quite up to date. But we can assume that another 360 people have died in the 12 days since. That is a total of 3,722 deaths. Almost four thousand people died after getting the COVID vaccines. The actual number is almost certainly much higher than that — perhaps vastly higher.”  Why isn’t anyone talking about this? Do doctors and other medical professionals now understand that you’re not supposed to talk about anything that goes against the Woke Supremacy’s COVID stance? We’re talking about our own lives here.",CDC Quietly Admits The Death Toll From COVID Vaccines Is Greater Than Every Vaccine In The Last 20 Years COMBINED,false,285745438442578180936789861954628585938

,"Dr. Anthony Fauci sat down with “Meta” CEO Mark Zuckerberg and finally said out loud what many people have been warning for over a year about the rushed mRNA vaccines: They may actually make the Covid pandemic worse.        Dr. Fauci was commenting on a recent study that showed that the Covid vaccines may actually make a recipient more likely to be reinfected than someone with natural immunity from a prior infection.  “This would not be the first time, if it happened, that a vaccine that looked good in initial safety actually made people worse,” Fauci said. “There was the history of the Respiratory Syncitial Virus vaccine in children, which paradoxically made the children worse.”  Pause and read that again. Now consider all of the announcements made by “public health experts” that promised the “vaccines” were “100% safe and effective,” even for children who are at nearly zero risk.  Are Democrats driving America towards socialism? * Yes, and it's horrible No, they're great (lol jk) Email * This poll gives you free access to our premium politics newsletter. Unsubscribe at any time. Name This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. Δ  Dr. Fauci wasn’t done yet, though. He went on to state another example that he was directly involved with where a treatment made individuals worse.  “One of the HIV vaccines that we tested several years ago actually made individuals more likely to get infected,” Fauci added.  The RSV vaccine’s failure was exposed in 2008 by researchers who finally untangled the decades-old mystery.  “In the late 1960s, children in Washington, DC received an RSV vaccine in which the virus was inactivated with formalin,” Reuters reported. “Eighty percent of the children given the shot were hospitalized with severe respiratory disease, and two died. Many scientists had thought the formalin was responsible for the vaccine’s problems, but the chemical has been used safely in other vaccines.”  “The problem, they report this month in the journal Nature Medicine, was that the children’s antibodies were not binding strongly enough to the inactivated virus to produce a protective immune response,” the report noted. “Instead, the antibodies were dragging the dead virus with them, triggering a massive attack by other arms of the immune system.”  It should be noted that in 2019, the NIH admitted that “we are still lacking a safe and effective RSV vaccine.” But it somehow developed a “safe and effective” Covid-19 vaccine in a matter of months?  As noted before, the American public has no way of knowing if the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was rigorously tested, because the FDA refuses to fully release the documents for 75 years. A “whistleblower” on the inside of Pfizer’s clinical trials has documented many alleged serious issues, including “falsifying data.”  The phenomenon that Dr. Fauci is alluding to, “leaky vaccines,” has been well-documented. A Penn State University study showed that “leaky” vaccines can cause viruses to become lethal for the unvaccinated.  “Not all vaccines prevent infection,” PSU noted. “Some, known as leaky vaccines, prolong host survival or reduce disease symptoms without preventing viral replication and transmission. Although leaky vaccines provide anti-disease benefits to vaccinated individuals, new research by CIDD’s Andrew Read, David Kennedy and colleagues at the Avian Oncogenic Virus Group in the United Kingdom, and The University of New England in Australia, has demonstrated that leaky vaccines can make the situation for unvaccinated individuals worse.”  “Leaky vaccines work by enhancing host immunity to a particular pathogen, without necessarily blocking or slowing viral replication,” the article continues. “The result is that infected but vaccinated individuals have extended survival, allowing highly virulent pathogen that would normally reach an evolutionary dead-end in a dead host, can transmit. The evolutionary consequences of high virulence are thus reduced and these pathogens can be selectively favored as a result of leaky vaccination. ”  A 2019 article in Healthline discussed the attempt to prevent Marek’s disease from spreading among chickens.  “After experiments done in a specialized pathogen-containment facility at The Pirbright Institute in the United Kingdom, the researchers concluded that the vaccines developed to combat Marek’s disease were imperfect or leaky,” the story notes.  “These vaccines also allow the virulent virus to continue evolving precisely because they allow the vaccinated individuals, and therefore themselves, to survive,” said Venugopal Nair, who led the research team.  “These less-than-perfect vaccines create a ‘leaky’ barrier against the virus,” the story continues. “Vaccinated individuals may get sick but have less severe symptoms, but the virus survives long enough to transmit to others, which allows it to survive and spread throughout a population.”  “Our research demonstrates that the use of leaky vaccines can promote the evolution of nastier ‘hot’ viral strains that put unvaccinated individuals at greater risk,” Nair said.  A new Harvard study recently showed that the mRNA “vaccines” endorsed by the FDA and CDC are worse than useless at stopping the spread of Covid-19.  The study of 68 nations and 2,947 counties in the United States published in the European Journal of Epidemiology showed that “At the country-level, there appears to be no discernable relationship between percentage of population fully vaccinated and new COVID-19 cases in the last 7 days. In fact, the trend line suggests a marginally positive association such that countries with higher percentage of population fully vaccinated have higher COVID-19 cases per 1 million people.”  That is exactly what Becker News had pointed out in September:  As the Covid pandemic continues to defy predictions about when it will finally be ‘over,’ there is a curious phenomenon taking place across the United States and around the globe: Covid-19 case rates increasing alongside vaccination rates. The textbook examples of this disturbing trend are the nations of Israel, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Israel is now experiencing its fourth wave, which is being accompanied by another round of ‘booster shots.’ Israel has 61.5% of all adults “fully vaccinated” (although the use of ‘booster shots’ throws the term into question.)  Meanwhile, a new independent study corroborates the famous Israeli study from August that shows natural immunity is superior to “vaccinated immunity.”  The latest study states that: “Confirmed infection rates increased according to time elapsed since the last immunity-conferring event in all cohorts. For unvaccinated previously infected individuals they increased from 10.5 per 100,000 risk-days for those previously infected 4-6 months ago to 30.2 for those previously infected over a year ago. For individuals receiving a single dose following prior infection they increased from 3.7 per 100,000 person days among those vaccinated in the past two months to 11.6 for those vaccinated over 6 months ago. For vaccinated previously uninfected individuals the rate per 100,000 person days increased from 21.1 for persons vaccinated within the first two months to 88.9 for those vaccinated more than 6 months ago.”  Thus, the vaccinated previously uninfected individuals are two-to-three times more likely to be reinfected after six months than unvaccinated previously infected individuals. One of the more useful aspects of this study is that it unpacks the overlap between vaccinated immunity and natural immunity; some research suggests the overlap between the two categories may be as high as 60-70%. Therefore, claims about “vaccinated immunity” may be benefiting from the fact that over half of the United States is estimated to have natural immunity.  The latest remarks from Dr. Fauci suggest that the NIAID chief is not surprised by the abysmal failure of the “vaccines” to stop the spread. Indeed, one wonders if it was all a “part of the plan.”  The Wildfire Newsletter is a free and paid subscription service provided by independent journalist Kyle Becker.

0b348ddd,"EDITOR’S NOTE: This story about Chinese Communist Party influence in U.S. elections is currently being suppressed by Facebook’s fact-checker “Lead Stories” which recently announced a partnership with the Chinese Communist Party-linked app TikTok.  Lead Stories is run by former CNN staf f, managed from Belgium, and their staff donate almost exclusively to Democratic Party candidates. Our original story continues below, unchanged, and factually accurate.  Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi confirmed this weekend that “China would prefer Joe Biden” to win the upcoming presidential election. The news follows months of National Pulse reporting linking the Democratic Presidential candidate to the Chinese Communist Party.  During an exchange on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday, Pelosi effectively confirmed a National Counterintelligence and Security Center NCSC report which concluded China “prefers President Trump doesn’t win re-election.”  The news will take the wind out of the sails of the left’s claims that President Trump has not been tough on China, and plants Joe Biden squarely in Beijing’s corner in November:  “The Chinese… what they said is [that] China would prefer [Biden]. Whether they do, that’s their conclusion. That they would prefer Joe Biden.“  WATCH:  China would prefer Joe Biden. – Nancy Pelosi pic.twitter.com/gI1RHmFNOu — Francis Brennan @FrancisBrennan August 9, 2020  Pelosi also failed to disavow the foreign election interference occurring at the hands of China – a hypocritical stance in light of her unfounded fearmongering over Russian interference in the 2016 election.  And the prospect of election interference at the hands of the CCP is considerably more likely.  As the NCSC’s report notes: “We assess that China prefers that President Trump – whom Beijing sees as unpredictable – does not win reelection. China has been expanding its influence efforts ahead of November 2020 to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressure political figures it views as opposed to China’s interests, and deflect and counter criticism of China.”  The charges are not far-fetched.  While serving as Senator and Vice President, Biden championed trade deals and economic policies amenable to the Chinese Communist Party CCP and, as a private-sector continuation of Biden’s China appeasement, his family members have profited immensely from countless deals with CCP-run companies.",WATCH: Pelosi Confirms ‘China Would Prefer Joe Biden’,false,
972048cd,"Snowflake students at Oxford University are the latest to demand that clapping should be banned because applause noise can trigger anxiety and want 'jazz hands' to be used instead. The idea for a British sign language alternative for clapping involving the waving of hands was put forward at the student union's first meeting of the year on Tuesday. Sabbatical Officers Roisin McCallion, Vice President for Welfare and Equal Opportunity and Ebie Edwards Cole, Chair for Oxford SU Disabilities Campaign, successfully passed the motion to mandate the encouragement of silent clapping. Sabbatical Officers Roisin McCallion (left), Vice President for Welfare and Equal Opportunity and Ebie Edwards Cole (right), Chair for Oxford SU Disabilities Campaign, successfully passed the motion to mandate the encouragement of silent clapping They argued that alternatives to traditional clapping have been in place to aid accessibility in some organisations since 2015. The ban on clapping would be at student union meetings and events where traditional clapping and cheering 'presents an access issue' to those with anxiety disorders. One former student, said: 'Oxford University Student Union is always seeking to be more accommodating for students. Especially for those with accessibility issues. 'But this idea will not work and is completely ludicrous.' The use of jazz hands - where students wave their hands in the air - is the British Sign Language expression for applause and is deemed a more inclusive gesture. The motion, which carried, mandates the encouragement of sign language clapping by Sabbatical Officers at union meetings and events (file photo of students at the Sheldonian Theatre in Oxford) It comes after the University of Manchester Students Union passed a motion to do the same thing in September last year.

e2abfbe6,"The Labour Party has accused the Government of failing patients after the Chancellor buried a £30 billion cut to day to day spending in the Department of Health and Social Care, as waiting lists hit a record high.  Leader of the Labour Party, Keir Starmer will visit a hospital in Derby this morning Thursday, as Budget documents revealed a planned cut in day to day spending in the Department of Health and Social Care of £30.1 billion from April this year.  It comes as new analysis published by the Labour Party reveals that:  The number of patients waiting more than 18 weeks for treatment has increased by over 500% over the last decade.  Almost a quarter of a million people are waiting more than a year for treatment.  An estimated 4.59 million people are currently on the waiting list for treatment – the highest ever number on record.  Even before the pandemic hit, the number of people waiting more than 18 weeks had spiralled over the previous nine years, to over 720,000 in December 2019.  Only 68% of patients on the waiting list have been waiting 18 weeks or less – the statutory target for 92% of patients to receive treatment within 18 weeks of referral has not been met since 2016.  The figures include patients waiting for hip and knee replacements and cataract removals, among many other procedures and treatments vital to people’s quality of life.  NHS England spending will fall from £147.7 billion this year to £139.1 billion from next despite the ongoing costs to the NHS from Covid and the huge backlog of cases and waiting lists that have built up during the crisis.  In November, the Health Foundation estimated that clearing the backlogs and reducing waiting times would cost around £2 billion a year over the next three years.  Commenting on the findings, Jonathan Ashworth MP, Shadow Health and Social Care Secretary, said:  “The Chancellor is failing patients, our NHS and its staff by cutting frontline services during a pandemic.  “With lists already at a record high, this will mean patients waiting even longer in pain for vital treatment.  “Yesterday’s Budget papered over the cracks rather than rebuilding the foundations of our country.”",Chancellor failing patients with his £30 billion NHS cut as waiting lists hit record high,false,
,"From TONY JOHN, Port Harcourt  Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has dissociated himself from those who were calling for the scrapping of the counterpart funding system for basic education in the country.  Governor Wike declared the stance of the State government on such calls when the Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, paid him a courtesy visit at Government House, Port Harcourt, yesterday.  He said the counterpart funding arrangement avails state governments the opportunity to show commitment in the provision of good educational foundation for children in their states.  Governor Wike said: “Here in this state, from the records that I have, there are over 100,000 out-of-school children. But they have been able to bring back 36 thousand to the classrooms. This is commendable.  “We have also accessed our counterpart funds from UBEC up to 2019. We are preparing to access 2020 funds. If you believe in the education of your people, then, as a government you must play a very prominent role.  “I’m not one of those governors, who will say that the federal government should scrap the counterpart funding. I hear, the Chairman of Governors Forum said so; but, I don’t agree to that. Every state must be committed.  “You cannot say you want to depend on federal government money alone, no. You, as a state government, must also show that you are committed to doing this. It is sad that in this country, everybody wants everything to come to them as free”.

Governor Wike stated that his administration understood the place of education in development, which was why not less than 30 percent was allocated to the sector.  He disclosed: “For us, education is basic. We can’t get it right until we focus on education. It’s unfortunate that the kind of budget I see for education in this country is terrible.  “When I see budget for Defence and others, and that of education that is either 2, 3, 7, or 10 percent of the budget and I know that doesn’t make sense.  “If you cannot put money in education and health, then, you can’t get it right. You don’t need to manage with education. It is one sector that government must understand that for any country to be developed, then, education is key.  “In this state, we have never given education less than 30 percent of our budget. Education and health are key. So, the federal government should try as much as they can to see that more funding is given to education”.  Speaking further, Governor Wike commended the Minister of State for Education and his Senior Minister for driving the programmes of the ministry apolitically.  Governor Wike noted that it was obvious that political consideration was not used to decide on Rivers State to be the first place to launch the “Better Education Service Delivery for All Programme for Result”, among other states in the zone.  Minister of State for Education, Nwajiuba, said they were in the state for the official launch of “Better Education Service Delivery for All Programme for Result”.  He said the programme was a jointly-owned facility of World Bank and the Federal Government that started in 2018, that is geared towards addressing the issue of out-of- school children across the country and ensure they return to the classrooms.",Education: Don’t scrap counterpart funding – Wike,false,297513102803273042738522945144353786894

Le Collectif citoyen de FranceSoir et l’association Bon Sens sont très attachés aux publications, analyses des données, du retour d'expérience des divers pays sur la vaccination, et se sont intéressés à l’article. Nous avons demandé à les interviewer afin de comprendre leur analyse et ses limites.  close  volume_off    Les auteurs de l'article déclarent n'avoir aucun conflit ou lien d’intérêt, autre que celui d’avoir des enfants en Israël.    Un debriefing complet qui, après une présentation, évoque leur analyse des données, les validations menées, les limitations et surtout les conclusions qu’ils demandent à confronter aux données demandées via une requête au ministère de la Santé, par le biais de l'équivalent de la CADA (Commission d’accès aux documents administratifs) israélienne.    Les constats sont simples :    Il y a une inadéquation entre les données publiées par les autorités et la réalité sur le terrain.    Ils ont trois sources d’information, outre les emails et messages d’effets secondaires qu’ils reçoivent par le biais d’internet.  Ces trois sources sont Ynet, site d'information israélien, la base de données du ministère de la santé israélien, et la base aux Etats-Unis du VAERS (effets secondaires).  En janvier 2021, il y a 3000 enregistrements d’effets secondaires des vaccins dont 2900 pour les vaccins ARNm.  Par rapport aux autres années, la mortalité est 40 fois supérieure.  Le 11 février un article de Ynet, présente des données liées à la vaccination. Les auteurs de l’article ont ""débunké"" cette analyse, en se basant sur les données publiées par Ynet.  « On a repris les données en regardant la mortalité pendant la période de la vaccination qui dure 5 semaines. En analysant ces données, on arrive à des chiffres effarants qui donnent une mortalité importante du vaccin. »  Les auteurs déclarent « que les vaccinations ont causé plus de décès que le coronavirus n'en aurait provoqué pendant la même période. »    Haim Yativ et le Dr Seligmann déclarent que pour eux « ceci est une nouvelle Shoah » devant la pression des autorités israéliennes pour vacciner les citoyens.

Analysis by infectious disease specialist claims mismatch between data published by authorities and reality on the ground.  Tags: Vaccination Mortality Biotechnology Israel Coronavirus  Mordechai Sones , Feb 18 , 2021 8:47 AM  Share    'Science will win': Pfizer  'Science will win': PfizeriStock    A front-page article appeared in the FranceSoir newspaper about findings on the Nakim website regarding what some experts are calling ""the high mortality caused by the vaccine.""    The paper interviews Aix-Marseille University Faculty of Medicine Emerging Infectious and Tropical Diseases Unit's Dr. Hervé Seligmann and engineer Haim Yativ about their research and data analysis. They claim that Pfizer's experimental shot causes ""mortality hundreds of times greater in young people compared to mortality from coronavirus without the vaccine, and dozens of times more in the elderly, when the documented mortality from coronavirus is in the vicinity of the vaccine dose, thus adding greater mortality from heart attack, stroke, etc.""    Dr Hervé Seligmann works at the Emerging Infectious and Tropical Diseases Research Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France. He is of Israeli-Luxembourg nationality. He has a B. Sc. In Biology from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and has written over 100 scientific publications.      FranceSoir writes that they follow publications, data analyzes, and feedback from various countries on vaccination, and have therefore taken an interest in the Nakim article, asking to interview them in order to understand their analysis and its limitations.    The authors of the article declare they have no conflicts or interests other than having children in Israel.    After a presentation, the authors discussed their data analysis, the validations carried out, limitations, and above all, their conclusions that they compare with data received via a Health Ministry Freedom of Information Act request.    Their findings are:    There is a mismatch between the data published by the authorities and the reality on the ground.  They have three sources of information, besides the emails and adverse event reports they receive through the Internet. These three sources are Israeli news site Ynet, the Israeli Health Ministry database, and the U.S. federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database.  In January 2021, there were 3,000 records of vaccine adverse events, including 2,900 for mRNA vaccines.  Compared to other years, mortality is 40 times higher.  On February 11, a Ynet article presented data related to vaccination. The authors of the Nakim article claim to have debunked this analysis based on data published by Ynet itself: “We took the data by looking at mortality during the vaccination period, which spans 5 weeks. By analyzing these data, we arrived at startling figures that attribute significant mortality to the vaccine.""  The authors say “vaccinations have caused more deaths than the coronavirus would have caused during the same period.""  Haim Yativ and Dr. Seligmann declare that for them, ""this is a new Holocaust,"" in face of Israeli authority pressure to vaccinate citizens.    They also invite specialists to complete their analyses, and intend to pursue legal follow-up to their discovery. The Health Ministry was not available for comment on a FranceSoir query regarding the findings.    The authors also deplored ""the fact of not being able to communicate on this vital information"" to their fellow citizens.    On their site, Nakim writes: ""On February 11, 2021, Ynet (the most known Israeli News website) published a confused and confusing article entitled 'Vaccination efficiency data in Israel, and its rapid effects on the young'.    ""Our reanalyses of these data explain why during the massive vaccination project initiated mid-December 2020 during a confinement, daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases failed to decrease as they do during confinements, and, more importantly, why numbers of serious, critical, and death cases increased during that period that covered at least one month. From mid-December to mid-February (two months), 2,337 among all Israeli 5,351 official COVID-deaths occurred. Our analyses indicate orders of magnitude increases in deaths rates during the 5-week long vaccination process, as compared to the unvaccinated and those after completing the vaccination process. Presumably, asymptomatic cases before vaccination, and those infected shortly after the 1st dose, tend to develop graver symptoms than those unvaccinated.    ""The Ynet article is organized in an exciting way and uses data provided in an erroneous way by the Ministry of Health. It is unclear whether this was intentional to prove the vaccine's efficiency or if this was done erroneously because the provided data were misunderstood. Note that in Israel, all vaccines are from Pfizer.    ""The data in the table, rather than indicating the vaccine efficacy, indicate the vaccine's adverse effects,"" the authors conclude.

Il serai intéressant de savoir pour qui Mr Kouts travail en tant que consultant considérant qu'il n'a même pas le besoin de développer son propre site web, ne serait ce pas pour Pfizer par hasard ou peut être carrément Mr Bill gates??dites le nous Mr Kouts nous voulons connaitre vos intérêts pour désinformer?    Mr Kouts a mis entre guillemet mon titre ""ingénieur israélien"" a titre de dénigrement. et bien Mr Kouts je vous joint mon attestation d’étude et de diplômé a l’école polytechnique de Haifa la plus réputé d’Israël et parmi les 100 premières mondiales dans mon domaine.  Inutile de vous préciser Mr Kouts que mon diplôme d’ingénieur en informatique/électronique est parmi les plus difficiles a obtenir au Technion si ce n'est le plus difficile, et je vous invite a juste essayer de passer l'examen pour y être juste accepter et de publier vos résultats sur twitter...          Pour nier la corrélation entre la montée de la mortalité et le début de la campagne de vaccination Mr Kouts écrit:    ""Pour rappel voici la courbe de mortalité COVID19 en Israël, effectivement la 3ème vague est beaucoup plus meurtrière, et pourrait coïncider avec le début de la vaccination en Israël.  En réalité pas vraiment, la vaccination a commencé le 19 décembre, les cas avaient déjà bien commencé à augmenter avant et on sait que c’est exponentiel à partie de là si on ne fait rien.""  Manque de chance Mr Kouts il n y a rien de prévisible dans une épidémie c'est le prof Raoult qui le dit et pour preuve que vous avez tord je vous ramène deux graphes l'un montrant que le 19.72020 il y a eu un pic de 76 malades dans un état grave qui a ensuite décliné et qui ne représente en rien un pic d’épidémie          et de la mème façon les 68 malades graves en date du 19.12.2020 date du début de la vaccination ne représentait absolument pas un signe de début de pic d'autant que c'est moins que le 19 juillet et que de plus nous étions en plein hiver.      Par contre la montée fulgurante de la mortalité immédiatement après le début de la vaccination conforte nos dires concernant la toxicité du ""vaccin"" de Pfizer.    Mr Kouts qui ne comprend rien aux chiffres manifestement, continue comme suit  ""Revenons à l’article, il s’intéresse donc à lier l’augmentation des morts par le vaccin, qui induirait du COVID19 (ou un autre truc idiot comme ça). Il aurait tué 40 fois plus dans la même période que la COVID19 elle-même.  Comment ils calculent ça ? Facile on prend une période avec moins de morts (tous les mois de mars jusqu’à début décembre), qu’on compare au mois le plus meurtrier de la pandémie en Israël (véridique, c'est sa méthodologie...).  (Remarquez qu’on passe de 3,5 fois à 40 fois on sait pas trop comment – 40 fois ça voudrait dire 334 * 40 = 13360 en un mois à comparer avec la mortalité totale en Israël qui est de 45 000 annuellement… n’importe quoi donc)""    gros mensonge puisque nous avons comparés les chiffres de mortalité a rien d'autre qu'au tableau rouge ramenè par Ynet, sur lequel ils se sont basé pour démontrer l’efficacité du vaccin de Pfizer en précisant bien que ce tableau parlait de comparaison sur 5 semaines.    Mr Kouts continu ses élucubrations en disant pas moins:  ""C’est donc évidemment totalement débile d’utiliser VAERS pour les cas en israël (pas la même population, densité, comorbiditsé…) ni les mêmes façon de vacciner selon les pays, ni les mêmes vaccins""    Mr Kouts il serait plutôt ""débile"" de ne pas comprendre qu' a été l'usage que nous avons fait des données du Vaers, les données américaines nous ont été utiles pour déterminer le rapport de la mortalité entre les ages du vaccin de Pfizer. Cette donnée n'est pas dépendante d'un pays quelconque. Mr kouts a de nouveau prouvé qu'il n'aurait jamais réussi les examens pour être admis au Technion, ne parlons pas d'y obtenir un diplôme.    continuons Mr Kouts qui a la technique du matraquage d'inepties pour fatiguer ses lecteurs passent ensuite enfin au grand tableau de Ynet avec les données.    ""On voit sur +60 ans 636 morts au total, mais surtout on voit que la grande majorité intervient dans les 13 jours après la première dose. Cela prouve donc l’efficacité du vaccin (qu'il ne veut pas voir)  Mais non, lui voit quoi ? Que le vaccin a tué 646 personnes et mis à l’hôpital 865 !  Voici son explication qui pour lui montre que c’est dû au vaccin pour l’hôpital""    Mr Kouts qui ne comprend absolument rien a la mortalité du covid voit dans le fait que les morts arrivent dans les 13 jours suivant la première dose la preuve de l’efficacité du vaccin, grave erreur Mr Kouts comme le prouve les rapports du Vaers sur le vaccin de Pfizer les morts tombent en moyenne dans les 4 jours suivant le vaccin.  De plus Mr Kouts la mortalité normale de gens testés positifs au Covid est bien inférieur a 1% cela incluant les vieux de plus de 80 ans, alors que dans le tableau sur lequel vous aussi vous vous appuyez pour vanter les mérites de Pfizer la mortalité globale est de 1.5 pourcent (660 pour 43871) alors que comme décrit durant l'interview les gens de plus de 80 ans qui représente 37% de la mortalité du covid en Israël n'y figurait pratiquement pas car vaccinés des la fin décembre et que le tableau est daté du 10 février. De plus les 1251 malades graves ou critiques du tableau et qui font parti intégrante de l’échantillon de 43871 vaccinés vont eux aussi malheureusement fournir leurs quotes parts de mortalité supérieur a 20% d'entre eux. cela nous amenant a une mortalité supérieur a 2% sur les 43871 vaccinés soit au minimum 3 fois supérieur a celle de gens non vaccines incluant les + de 80 ans alors que le tableau de Ynet ne les incluaient pas.    De plus Mr Kouts fait abstraction des morts subites (cardiaques, AVC) suite au ""vaccin"" de Pfizer qui ne sont pas comptabilisées comme des décès Covid.      pour terminer l'embrouille, Mr Kouts nous ramène au début de la video sur le VAERS et nous dis:  ""(sur la vidéo france soir ils comparent les morts vaccins covid en janvier 2021 VS tous les autres vaccins en janvier 2020 - les 2 sans aucune base et source - enfin c'est pas clair et ils sont pas d'accord entre eux)""    gros mensonges supplémentaires que voila, alors que nous parlions du Vaers pour signifier l’énorme nombre de décès rapportés en Janvier 2021 aux états unis pendant la vaccination pfizer/Moderna de 456 décès sur 3000 rapports comparés a seulement 14 décès en Janvier 2020 sur un nombre similaires de rapports concernant des vaccins classiques.    en Résumé Mr Ari Kouts fait parti des innombrables Troll que je côtoie sur facebook diffusant de la désinformation. au vu du nombre de Tweet mensonger de ce monsieur il me semble qu'il était grand temps de lui clouer le bec.

(son article est également joint plus bas en PDF au cas ou...)    Comme je l’ai écris avec Mr Kouts plus haut quand il s’agit de santé publique je suis sans pitié donc Mr Soleil désolé pour ce qui va suivre.    Je n’ai pas réagis tout de suite car j’étais occupé et grand bien m’en a pris car l’article de Mr Soleil a été repris ici devinez par qui ? par MSN network oui !!! le réseau de Microsoft celui de B I L L G A T E S du coup d’une pierre deux coups !    J’étais donc occupé a débunker ici l’article pseudo-scientifique du New England Journal of medicine de mes concitoyens Israéliens ventant les qualités du « vaccin » Coco-vide de Pfizer voir ici, oui oui ceux la même qui avouent toucher des subventions de Pfizer pour leur «bons et loyaux » services a la science. Donc après avoir démontrer avec le Dr Seligmann que leur papier scientifique et aussi neutre et fiable qu’une pub de Pfizer nous pouvons enfin passer a Mr Soleil qui a lui aussi tenter de nous « éclairer » sur les mérites de l’injection d’ARN expérimentale de Pfizer (désolé de ne pas l’appeler vaccin mais notez que je me suis retenu par respect pour vous d’écrire poison ).    Mr Soleil commence mal en traitant Nakim de « site avec des contenus à forte teneur conspirationniste » Mr Soleil qui détient la vérité première qui lui a probablement été transmise par Bill Gates en personne a appris l’hébreu et le droit israélien en deux temps trois mouvements et s’est également spécialisé sur le sujet de la corruption en Israël et du haut de son génie nullement égalé s’est déjà permis de jauger les actions juridiques et autres de NAKIM à la cours suprême en Israël cités maintes fois par la presse israélienne et a nous traiter de conspirationniste a deux balles… bon ok avec le Soleil on ne discute pas…    Après avoir rabaissé le support c’est au tour des auteurs :  « L’auteur du billet, Haim Yativ, se présente comme un ingénieur » je ne me présente pas comme un ingénieur dommage de ne pas avoir lu avant ma réponse a votre collègue Ari Kouts, je suis ingénieur et diplômé de pas n’importe quelle école un ptit coup d’œil au dessus chez Kouts votre altesse…  Quand au Dr Seligmann il n’est pas un médecin distribuant des médicaments comme le conçoit Mr Soleil mais c’est un biologiste chercheur ayant publié plus de 100 articles scientifiques et ayant travaillé des années chez le Prof Raoult, bref a la pointe dans le domaine.    Mr Soleil continue donc bien lancé avec ses inepties et nous raconte des « histoires de pomme et d’orange » :  « Le hic, cependant, c’est qu’il compare des pommes avec des oranges : le nombre de patients dans un état grave est un «instantané» qui ne concerne qu’une seule journée alors que le tableau de Ynet cumule des cas survenus sur une assez longue période (au moins deux semaines, voire plus). Pour s’en faire une idée, on n’a qu’à songer au fait que le tableau de Ynet fait état de 660 décès alors que la COVID-19 tue environ 35 personnes par jour depuis un mois. On ne peut donc absolument rien tirer d’une telle comparaison. »    Mr Soleil qui lit ce qui l’arrange a apparemment omis dans l’article la phrase :  “For that purpose we need first to understand that the provided table describes the state of COVID-19 patients that got the first or the second vaccine dose at given dates, as started in the article ""…emerges from the data that among 856 patients above 60 years in serious state hospitalized at this time…"" we assume that the article published February 11 reflects the situation in hospitals the previous day, hence February 10 2021, or February 11 2021.”    Le tableau nous décrit donc clairement le nombre de gens hospitalisés a la date de l’article et pas accumulé comme le prétend Mr Soleil, en cas de doute Mr Soleil qui comprend si bien l’hébreu comme dit plus haut aurais pu se pencher sur la version israélienne qui est sans appel « kaet » est en hébreu a l’instant présent.    Quand au nombre de décès il est bien évidemment accumulé comme nous l’avons bien décrit dans l’article.    Maintenant sûre de lui Mr Soleil s’arme de chiffre de la banque mondiale pas moins (dis moi qui tu fréquente je te dirais qui tu es…) pour nous dire que la mortalité de 0.05% pour 5 semaines est à peine plus élevé que la mortalité attendue de 0.048%    Le paramètre qu’oublie notre prétendu critique scientifique c’est notre phrase: "" This death rate relates mainly to a relatively young population whose vaccination stated on January 19, a period during which most vaccinated were below 65.""    Qui explique donc pourquoi ce chiffre de mortalité est excessif puisque la part du lion de la mortalité en Israël comme dans tout autre pays est compose des gens de plus de 65 ans et pas le contraire.    De plus et essentiellement la mortalité de 0.5% par an ramenée par Mr Soleil est la mortalité globale toute cause confondue incluant suicide accident de voiture cancers, attaque cardiaque et autre, alors que l’année passée la part du Covid dans cette mortalité était de bien moins de 10%. Tant et si bien qu'une mortalité que de Covid qui dépasse la mortalité générale habituelle sur cette période de 5 semaine et cela pour une écrasante majorité de gens de moins de 65 ans cela est une CATASTROPHE.    Mr Soleil continue avec ses élucubrations sous le titre « –la pire vague » expliquant que la hausse de la mortalité en décembre a février est juste causée par la monte des cas Covid. Manque de pot pour la lumière émanant du cerveau de Mr Soleil, nous avons débunké l’article du New England Journal Of Médicine et au passage nous avons glané la preuve de nos dires de leurs propres données. La première injection de Pfizer multiplie par 3 le nombre de malades Covid chez les vaccinés. Maintenant que je vous ai mis a l’ombre Mr Soleil, Je vous invite a lire notre article, puisque faute d’emploi vous aurez tout le temps de réfléchir a vos actes d’avoir encouragé les gens a se faire vacciner avec ce produit plus qu’inquiétant.

Pearson  No Comments  0  SHARES  SHARE ON FACEBOOK  SHARE ON TWITTER  Advertisements    By Niall McCrae-    Anyone raising concern about the safety of Covid-19 vaccines faces derision as an ‘anti-vaxxer’, but the real extremists are those who refuse to hear evidence that something is going badly wrong with this mass experimental intervention. Now a Public Health England  Advertisements    report confirms that infections increase during the fortnight after vaccination.    As the vaccination programme began in earnest in January, worrying signs came from care homes, where many of the initial target population of people aged over 80 reside. At Pemberley House in Basingstoke, a third of the residents (24) died of Covid-19 in a home that had previously been free from the disease. Similar reports emerged from Germany.    The clearest indications came from small countries that strove to vaccinate their entire adult population. The British enclave of Gibraltar was supplied with the Pfizer vaccine on 16th January and the elderly were swiftly jabbed. Suddenly this tiny state, home to 33 thousand, had the worst Covid-19 morality in the world (now 2761 per million). From merely 9 deaths in December, now almost a hundred have died. The health minister angrily denied claims that the vaccine was killing people, but eventually admitted that some deaths had occurred in recipients.    The United Arab Emirates received large batches of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine as well as the Pfizer product in December. As stated by Amer Sharif, head of the Covid-19 Command & Control Centre in Dubai, the UAE aimed to be the first country in the world to achieve 100% vaccination of eligible adults. An increase in deaths was attributed to mutant strains, but as in other countries the rate rose disproportionately in the vaccinated age band. On 10th February a new daily high of 18 deaths from the coronavirus was recorded, and the trend has continued. Considerably more people are dying than in the first wave last spring – despite the hubristic inoculation.    More evidence of iatrogenic harm came from Israel, which started vaccinating on 19th December. As reported by former New York Times journalist Alex Berenson, while Covid-19 mortality escalated among Israelis throughout January, in Palestine it declined steeply after a surge in December. Yet the Palestinians had no vaccine.    This correlation is more than coincidental. Analysis    of Israeli health ministry data by Hervé Seligmann at Aix-Marseilles University indicates that about 40 times more elderly people died of Covid-19 in the three weeks between their first and second doses than among those who were not vaccinated. Sacrificial lambs? Deaths in Israel are now falling, which politicians and media attribute to the vaccine, although there is a global trend of the virus becoming less deadly.    The mortal complication has a temporal pattern that varies between countries, apparently depending on when vaccination started. Jordan was supplied with 3800 tons of Sinopharm on 9th January, after approval for ‘emergency use’. The King of Jordan and other prominent figures were shown on television receiving the vaccine, to encourage the people to follow. A deal was also struck for 2.2 million doses of the Pfizer product. At this time nearly four thousand had died of Covid-19.    By the end of February half a million had been jabbed, but this was slow progress in a land of ten million. Meanwhile coronavirus cases had surged, as had deaths. A night curfew was imposed. Yet most of those dying were in the age group prioritised for the vaccine; many would have had the supposedly life-saving substance. Yesterday another 37 died, and the death toll is now approaching five thousand. Perhaps that explains hesitancy in the Hashemite kingdom.    It should not be unexpected that Covid-19 vaccines have deleterious as well as intended effects. Pfizer data shows significant lymphocyte depletion in the first week after vaccination. June Raine, chief of the UK medicines regulator MHRA, acknowledged that ‘a week or two’ is needed to build up immunity after the first jab.    The Public Health England study, which was hailed by health secretary Matt Hancock for the reported 80% decrease in hospitalisations, actually showed a 48% rise in infections after the first dose of Pfizer and Astra Zeneca vaccines. The authors, however, blamed this on a higher risk of exposure. Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at PHE, stated that ‘this adds to growing evidence that the vaccines are working to reduce infections and save lives’. She glossed over the hundreds who died after getting the jab.    This is what may be happening. Vulnerable people who unknowingly had Covid-19 or whose immune system was keeping it at bay, succumbed to the disease after the vaccine lowered their immunity. The virus struck hard, leading to sever symptoms, cytokine storm and pneumonia. It is also possible that previously shielding persons were cross-infected by the vaccinators.    This needs proper scrutiny, not reckless denial by those who are meant to protect us. This defensiveness and censorship is how the thalidomide scandal arose. The authorities have apparently cast aside everything we have learned about ethical safeguards in clinical and experimental treatment. Perhaps it is relevant that the British medicine regulator is heavily funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.    Why aren’t doctors raising the alert? In medical training, hardly a day is given to learning about vaccines, and Big Pharma has undue influence on this noble profession. With critical thinking and dissent stifled by the Covid regime, most doctors are mere conformists. We must appeal to the brave few medics to continue their efforts to expose the deadly hazard of this highly dubious intervention.

(his article is also attached below in PDF in case Mr Soleil and Bill Gates' MSN/Dan Satherley will retract...) As I wrote with Mr. Kouts above when it comes to public health I am ruthless so Mr. Soleil sorry for what follows.    I didn’t react right away because I was busy and it was very good for me because Mr. Soleil’s article was picked up, guess by whom? by MSN network yes !!! !!! the Microsoft network that of B I L L G A T E S!!! with one stone two birds!      So I was busy debunking here the pseudo-scientific article of the New England Journal of medicine of my fellow Israelis touting the qualities of Pfizer's Coco-vid “vaccine”, yes yes those same who admit receiving grants from Pfizer for their “good and loyal” service to science.    So after having demonstrated with Dr Seligmann that their scientific paper is as neutral and reliable as a Pfizer ad, we can finally move on to Mr Soleil who also tried to ""enlighten"" us on the merits of the experimental RNA injection from Pfizer (sorry not to call it a vaccine but note that out of respect for you I refrained from writing poison).    Mr. Soleil starts badly by treating Nakim as a ""site with high conspiracy content"" Mr. Soleil who holds the primary truth which was probably transmitted to him by Bill Gates in person learned Hebrew and Israeli law in two days and has also specialized in the subject of corruption in Israel and from the height of his unparalleled genius has already taken the liberty of gauging the legal and other actions of NAKIM at the Supreme Court in Israel cited many times by the Israeli press and to treat us as a double-barreled conspirator ... well, ok with the Sun, we don't argue ...      After lowering the medium, it's the authors' turn: ""The author of the post, Haim Yativ, presents himself as an engineer"" I do not present myself as an engineer too bad not to have read before my answer to your colleague Ari Kouts, I am an engineer and a graduate of not just any school but the Technion, a little glance above at my Kouts debunking your highness ...    As for Dr Seligmann, he is not a doctor distributing drugs as Mr Soleil conceives, but he is a research biologist who has published more than 100 scientific articles and who worked for years with Prof Didier Raoult, in short at the cutting edge in the field.    Mr. Soleil therefore continues well with his ineptitude and tells us ""stories of apple and orange"": ""The problem, however, is that he compares apples with oranges: the number of patients in serious condition is a 'snapshot' which concerns only one day while the Ynet table accumulates cases that have occurred over a fairly long period (at least two weeks, or even longer). To get an idea, one only has to think of the fact that the Ynet table shows 660 deaths as COVID-19 has killed around 35 people a day for the past month. So absolutely nothing can be drawn from such a comparison. ""    Mr. Soleil, who reads what suits him, apparently omitted from the article the sentence: “For that purpose we need first to understand that the provided table describes the state of COVID-19 patients that got the first or the second vaccine dose at given dates, as started in the article""… emerges from the data that among 856 patients above 60 years in serious state hospitalized at this time… ""we assume that the article published February 11 reflects the situation in hospitals the previous day, hence February 10 2021, or February 11 2021.""    The table therefore clearly describes the number of people hospitalized at the date of the article and not accumulated as claimed by Mr. Soleil, in case of doubt Mr. Soleil who understands Hebrew so well as said above could have looked into the Israeli version which is without appeal ""kaet"" is in Hebrew at this day.  As for the number of deaths, it is obviously accumulated as we have described in the article.    Now sure of himself, Mr Soleil is armed with data from the World Bank no less (tell me who you frequent I would tell you who you are ...) to tell us that the mortality of 0.05% for 5 weeks is barely higher than the expected mortality of 0.048% The parameter that our alleged scientific critic forgets is our sentence: ""This death rate relates mainly to a relatively young population whose vaccination stated on January 19, a period during which most vaccinated were below 65."" So that explains why this death figure is excessive since the lion's share of mortality in Israel as in any other country is made up of people over 65 and not the other way around.  In addition and essentially the mortality of 0.5% per year reported by Mr Soleil is the overall mortality from all causes including suicide, car accident, cancer, heart attack and other, while last year the share of Covid in this mortality was far less than 10%.  So much so that a mortality from Covid which exceeds the usual general mortality over this period of 5 weeks and that for an overwhelming majority of people under the age of 65 this is a CATASTROPHE.    Mr Soleil continues with his rantings under the title ""- the worst wave"" explaining that the increase in mortality in December to February is just caused by the rise in Covid cases. unluckily for the light emanating from Mr. Sun's brain, we debunked the New England Journal Of Medicine article and in the process gleaned evidence for our claims from their own data. The first injection of Pfizer multiplies by 3 the number of Covid patients among the vaccinated.    Now that I have put you in the shade Mr Soleil, I invite you to read our article,since for lack of employment you will have all the time to think about your acts of having encouraged people to be vaccinated with this product more that worrying.    Concerning your final and your verdict Mr Jean-François Cliché aka Mr Soleil, you now know what to do with it given our debunking of the scientific article you, Bill Gates' MSN, Dan Satherley and the Israeli Ministry of Health rely on.      concerning your peer Dan Satherley who wrote in addition to your false claims:    ""Another claim in the post is that deaths from COVID-19 in Israel are now slowing because the vaccination campaign is ""losing its momentum"". This is demonstrably false - since mid-January, the number of people dying from COVID-19 each day has more than halved, while vaccination data shows the number of doses administered in Israel has continued its upward trajectory over the past two months, with no signs of slowing down.""    Mr Satherley seems as well specialized in disinformation since we wrote in feb 15.2021:  ""The decrease in vaccinations and in vaccination age will cause a decrease in serious cases""  so from mid january it start getting down because from mid january the 65 and below start being shot with the pfizer RNA experimental product.    if we take a look to what happens since our article in Israel we can see that there was a decrease of serious case of 30 percent that match the decrease of the first shot vaccination rate:  decrease of serious case from 1008 on feb,15 2021 to 710 on march,6 2021      decrease of the vaccination on last 3 weeks  the dark green is the first shot        In conclusion: LeSoleil/Jean-François Cliche+Msn/Dan Satherley=Bill Gates=FAKE NEWS for pushing people to take the shot.

,"The disreputable, faux Biden administration and its media cohorts have perpetrated yet another fallacy on the American public by claiming that Colin Powell died of “Covid-19 complications” despite being fully vaccinated. Although breakthrough infections that result in death are becoming more common and broadly reported by alternative media, Colin Powell had never received a positive Covid-19 diagnosis or displayed symptoms commonly associated with the China virus, said an administration whistleblower speaking under promise of anonymity.  The administration and the media have released scant details on his death, obfuscating both where he died and the approximate time of death, but were quick to blame his demise on Covid-19.  Powell, who had suffered from multiple myeloma, a blood cancer, committed suicide early Monday morning, our source said.  “Powell died at home after consuming a bottle of prescription sleeping pills,” he said.  According to him, Powell’s wife Alma awoke at 3:00 a.m. and noticed that her husband was not breathing. She discovered an empty bottle of Ambien, which had been nearly full the night previous, tucked amid the bedsheets.  “Alma called 911. She said the bottle was almost full because Colin had filled it only a few days ago. 911 routed the Call directly to the White House, which has never been heard of. No paramedics, no ambulances showed up at his McClean, Virginia, home—only the FBI,” our source said.  Two FBI Special Agents and an agency forensic pathologist arrived at the Powell’s residence shortly after 4:00 a.m. They found Mrs. Powell in a state of hysteria, screaming and crying at the top her lungs as she hovered over late husband’s corpse. After a thorough examination of the bedroom, one agent found what appeared to be a suicide note on the floor beside the Powell’s bed.  “I’ll love you always, Alma, you and the children. But I am old and sick, and I know they’ll find me soon, like they have the others. I don’t want my legacy to end that way. I pray you can all forgive me, for what I’ve done, and now what I no longer have to do. The man in the glass tower must not rise. I place myself in the Lord’s hands; I’d rather He judge me than them,” part of the note purportedly read.  Powell, who had identified as a Republican, was a RINO—Republican in name only. He was an outspoken opponent of Donald J. Trump, and he had endorsed both Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden’s bids for the presidency.  “The FBI made a call directly to Kamala Harris, and she told them they’d have to spin the death to make it appear as if he died from Covid,” our source said. “The FBI is a tool of the Deep State.”  The administration and the CDC have been instructing health institutions and city and county coroners to falsify death certificates to make it seem as if every human fatality over the last two years was a result of Covid-19.  RRN will supply updates as available.  (Visited 10 times, 10 visits today)",Colin Powell Committed Suicide,false,23449566086561061454458153938563580429
684c9ba4,"Constitutional Attorney Matthew DePerno is an American hero. Two weeks ago, Michigan 13th Circuit Court Judge Kevin A Elsenheimer agreed to allow Mr. DePerno’s client, William Bailey, and a highly skilled team of IT experts to perform a forensic examination on 16 of the Dominion voting machines in Antrim County. On Monday, Judge Elsenheimer agreed to allow the results of the forensic examination to be released to the public. The results were damning.  THE REPORT:  After the forensic examination of 16 Dominion Voting machines in Antrim, Co., MI, Allied Security Operations Group has concluded that the Dominion Voting machines were assigned a 68.05% error rate. DePerno explained that when ballots are put through the machine, a whopping 68.05% error rate means that 68.05% of the ballots are sent for bulk adjudication, which means they collect the ballots in a folder. “The ballots are sent somewhere where people in another location can change the vote,” DePerno explained. The allowable election error rate established by the Federal Election Commission guidelines is 1 in 250,000 ballots or .0008%.  Based on the Allied Security Operations report, Constitutional Attorney Matthew DePerno states: “we conclude that The Dominion Voting System should not be used in Michigan. We further conclude that the results of Antrim County should not have been certified.  The stunning report was widely criticized by the Democrat Party mainstream media and by the dishonest Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson.  TRENDING: Our Motherf*ckin Streets! Antifa Terrorists March Through NYC in Riot Gear - Media Silent VIDEO  Following the bombshell findings by Mr. DePerno and his team of IT experts, a “risk-limited audit” was ordered by Sec. of State Benson. Constitutional Attorney Matt DePerno was invited to observe the “risk-limiting audit” of Antrim County’s vote that took place yesterday in the Kearney Twp. hall in Bellaire, MI., where 6 officials from the Secretary of State continuously walked around the room observing and correcting the counters who dared to stray from their objectives.  According to Verified Voting: The risk-limiting audit process can be conducted on any set of paper ballots that has a record of the number of ballots cast, how they are stored, and how to retrieve any particular ballot ballot manifest. For an RLA to meaningfully support confidence in the reported election outcome, the standard is higher, and requires the following:  Paper ballots preferably marked by hand and supplemented with a ballot marking device for those who need to use one.  A deliberate and intentional step for a voter to check the paper ballot for accuracy before casting the ballot voter verification.  Rigorous ballot accounting and a properly maintained chain of custody of the ballots.  If photographic evidence proves seals on the Dominion voting machines were broken on November 27, how can a “properly maintained chain of custody of ballots” be assured. The answer is, it can’t.  Before her so-called audit was completed, Sec of State Benson explained the purpose of the “risk limited audit” to the media while ensuring the integrity of the elections in Michigan:  “While we know the machine tabulators functioned properly in Antrim, we are conducting this audit to assure the public of what countless officials from both parties at the federal, state and local levels have already confirmed – that this was the most secure election in our nation’s history and the certified results are an accurate reflection of the will of the voters,” adding, “It is time for Michigan, and the nation to once and for all dismiss the meritless disinformation campaign that seeks to undermine the integrity of our election and move forward in support of our collective democracy.”  Mr. DePerno, who acted as an observer to the “risk-limited audit,” doesn’t agree with Ms. Benson about the integrity of Michigan’s election and has provided us with video and photographic evidence to prove that he was again able to debunk her statement about the “most secure election in our nation’s history.”  The first video provided by Matthew DePerno shows a bin of ballots from Mancelona Township, Precinct #1. The bin was delivered to three of the 20 bi-partisan volunteers that included several Antrim Co. city clerks who agreed to assist with the “risk-limited audit.”  Inside the bin, tabulated ballots were mixed in with ballots that were never tabulated, and several blank ballots were mixed in as well. Mr. DePerno referred to the bin of ballots as “an absolute mess!” On December 16, we reported about photographs taken at Mancelona Township’s Precinct #1 on November 27, 2020, that showed both of the security seals on the Dominion Voting machine were missing.  The second video was taken at a table where ballots were being counted in Helena Twp. The volunteers can be seen questioning why there were fewer ballots in the bin than the original number that was recorded in the previous recount? Shortly after asking the question, a male SOS official approached the table with a bag marked “spoiled ballots” and told them to count them. ATtorney Matt DePerno witnessed the unidentified male SOS rep pulling the “spoiled ballot bag out of the bin and delivering it to the volunteers who were “auditing” the ballots. DePerno also witnessed the SOS official telling them to add the “spoiled ballots” to the count.  The third video was taken at a table where the ballots from Central Lake Twp. were being counted. In the video, a male counter can be seen questioning “multiple ballots with the same signature.” According to Matthew DePerno, 138 ballots had write-in-votes where the penmanship was exactly the same.  In the video below, the SOS official can be seen demanding that the counters ignore what they believe is voter fraud and count the ballots.  “We need to do the counts because if we don’t have the counts, then we can’t move forward. And we understand that there is a concern with this precinct—but this is not a time for you to be investigating right now.”  “Did you find something else?” the male counter asks.  “No,” she replies, adding, “So, you need to move forward with the audit, so we can get the numbers, so we can see how many ballots are here.”  The female counter asks, “So when we’re done with the audit, there’s still the opportunity to challenge the fact that we have multiple ballots with the very same signature?” she asks.  “I don’t know if ‘challenge’ is the right word,” the SOS official says.  “But we’re challenging—” the volunteer says.  The male volunteer tells the SOS, “We’ll go ahead and count the ballots moving forward, but we will separate out, and count those— there’s going to be an asterisk, saying ‘these ballots have the same signature.'”  “And again, we know that you have a concern with this precinct,” she tells them, explaining, “That’s not your role at this very moment,” as she continues to push for them to ignore the multiple matching signatures and only count the ballots.  “What I need you to do right now is finish the audit,” she tells them again. Both of the volunteers explain that they are going to make a note of the ballots, to which the SOS official replies, “Again, that is not the process.”  The SOS official implores them to continue to count the presidential ballots.  At no point does the SOS official assure them that the issue of the multiple potentially fraudulent ballots will be addressed, but instead demands that they count them as if they were all legitimate ballots.  In this video, the SOS official can be seen telling the volunteers who are objecting to adding the ballots in question to the vote total, “This is not an investigation right now!”  On December 16, one day after Dominion Voting Systems CEO John Poulos testified in front of the MI Senate Oversight Committee, Mr. DePerno contacted us to say Poulos was incorrect in his statement that the ballots were securely stored. In fact, Mr. Derno provided us with photos showing seals were broken on one of the tabulators. DePerno explained, “In Central Lake, the lock that protects the side data port where you can insert a thumb drive in order to perform a software upgrade, that could change the program, was missing.” He explains, “The missing lock gives the ability of any person, including a voter to change the Dominion Voting machine program.”  Mr. DePerno explained to us that once the seals are broken, and the lock is removed, the integrity of the machines has been compromised. “It definitely showed that someone had accessed the inside of the tabulator, and it no longer represents a secure voting platform,” DePerno said.  The bin or box seen in the image below is where the ballots are stored. DePerno explained, “If you remove the tape, it gives you the ability to separate the tabulator from the box that contains the ballots.”  The photo below shows the stack of ballots in Central Lake that were cast for Joe Biden. The ballots that are pulled forward are all ballots that the counters pulled forward after objecting to the legitimacy of the ballots.  Mr. DePerno was stunned by the number of blank ballots that were mixed in with actual ballots, saying that he believes he observed more blank ballots in the recount than there are registered voters in Antrim County.  DePerno told us, “The guidelines from RLA were not followed. What they did yesterday was not an audit under those guidelines. It was a hand recount of the presidential race only and failed to address many of the problems with down-ballot races. Members of the public who assisted in the hand recount were not allowed to ask any questions or question any ballots. This hand recount also failed to address any of the glaring problems from the erroneous counts conducted on November 3 and November 6. Yesterday was nothing more than political theatre designed to allow the Secretary of State to again publish the same false narrative to the Michigan voters. Yesterday, when the people conducting the count dared ask questions, they were shut down.”  DePerno’s forensic and photographic evidence should be enough to call the entire Michigan election into question. Will the media or the courts care, or have we now entered a period in our nation’s history where we have officially become a Banana Republica after decades of Republicans ignoring the corruption of our media and our judicial system.",MI Sec of State Official Caught On Video Telling Volunteers To Count “Multiple Ballots with the very Same Signature” During “Audit” Of Votes In Antrim County,false,
,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s announcement Monday that it had granted “full approval” to the Covid shots being offered by Pfizer is riddled with deceptions meant to trick the American public into thinking they have no choice but to take the jab while at the same time protecting a major pharmaceutical company from legal liability.  What was actually given full approval was a separate Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine product which goes by the name Comirnaty.  But Comirnaty is not even currently available in the U.S.  This is part of a cynical plot to protect Pfizer from broad legal liability and also to snooker U.S. employers into mandating the vaccine for their employees.  Watch Dr. Robert Malone, inventer of the mRNA technology on which the Covid vaccines are based, explain the chicanery the FDA is using to fool the American people.  The FDA on Monday approved a biologics license application for the Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine. The Biden White House, with cover from its corporate media shills, immediately reported that vaccine mandates are now legal for military, healthcare workers, college students and employees of just about any business.  But as Children’s Health Defense reports, “there are several bizarre aspects to the FDA approval that will prove confusing to those not familiar with the pervasiveness of the FDA’s regulatory capture, or the depths of the agency’s cynicism.”  The FDA acknowledges that while Pfizer has insufficient supplies of the newly licensed Comirnaty vaccine actually available, there is “a significant amount” of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine — which has been produced under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and will continue to be offered under the same EUA status, CHD reports.  The FDA in its convoluted letter of approval for the Pfizer vaccine under the EUA should remain unlicensed but can be used “interchangeably” (page 2, footnote 8) with the newly licensed Comirnaty product [which is currently unavailable].  According to the FDA, the newly licensed Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine and the existing vaccine, while “legally distinct,” are not any different in terms of their “safety or effectiveness.”  Here is the pertinent quote from footnote 8 that proves we are talking about two separate shots and not just a “rebranding” of the same shot as the mainstream media is reporting:  “The licensed vaccine has the same formulation as the EUA-authorized vaccine and the products can be used interchangeably to provide the vaccination series without presenting any safety or effectiveness concerns. The products are legally distinct with certain differences that do not impact safety or effectiveness.”  The “certain differences” are not specified, but it is perfectly clear that the two jabs are legally distinct.  The below analysis by Children’s Health Defense explains the trickery in which the FDA has engaged — all for the legal benefit of the Big Pharma giant Pfizer and the detriment of American citizens.  There is a huge real-world difference between products under an EUA compared with those that FDA has fully licensed. EUA products are experimental under U.S law.  Both the Nuremberg Code and Federal Regulations provide that no one can force a human being to participate in this experiment. Under 21 U.S. Code Sec.360bbb-3(e)(1)(A)(ii)(III), “authorization for medical products for use in emergencies,” it is unlawful to deny someone a job or an education because they refuse to be an experimental subject. Instead, potential recipients have an absolute right to refuse EUA vaccines.  U.S. laws, however, permit employers and schools to require students and workers to take licensed vaccines.  EUA-licensed vaccines have an extraordinary liability shield under the 2005 Public Readiness and Preparedness Act. Vaccine manufacturers, distributors, providers and government planners are immune from liability. The only way an injured party can sue is if he or she can prove willful misconduct, and if the U.S. government has also brought an enforcement action against the party for willful misconduct. No such lawsuit has ever succeeded.  The government has created an extremely stingy compensation program, the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program, to redress injuries from all EUA products.  The program’s parsimonious administrators have compensated under 4% of petitioners to date — and not a single COVID vaccine injury — despite the fact that physicians, families and injured vaccine recipients have reported more than 600,000 COVID vaccine injuries.  At least for the moment, the Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine has no liability shield. Vials of the branded product, which say “Comirnaty” on the label, are subject to the same product liability laws as other U.S. products.  When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices places a vaccine on the mandatory schedule, a childhood vaccine benefits from an generous retinue of liability protections.  But licensed adult vaccines, including the new Comirnaty, do not enjoy any liability shield. Just as with Ford’s exploding Pinto, or Monsanto’s herbicide Roundup, people injured by the Comirnaty vaccine could potentially sue for damages.  And because adults injured by the vaccine will be able to show that the manufacturer knew of the problems with the product, jury awards could be astronomical.  Pfizer is therefore unlikely to allow any American to take a Comirnaty vaccine until it can somehow arrange immunity for this product.  Given this background, the FDA’s acknowledgement in its approval letter that there are insufficient stocks of the licensed Comirnaty, but an abundant supply of the EUA Pfizer BioNTech jab, exposes the “approval” as a cynical scheme to encourage businesses and schools to impose illegal jab mandates.  The FDA’s clear motivation is to enable Pfizer to quickly unload inventories of a vaccine that science and the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System have exposed as unreasonably dangerous, and that the Delta variant has rendered obsolete.  Americans, told that the Pfizer COVID vaccine is now licensed, will understandably assume that COVID vaccine mandates are lawful. But only EUA-authorized vaccines, for which no one has any real liability, will be available during the next few weeks when many school mandate deadlines occur.  The FDA appears to be purposefully tricking American citizens into giving up their right to refuse an experimental product.  While the media has trumpeted that the FDA has approved COVID vaccines, the FDA has not approved the Pfizer BioNTech vaccines, nor any COVID vaccines for the 12- to 15-year age group, nor any booster doses for anyone.  And FDA has not licensed any Moderna vaccine, nor any vaccine from Johnson & Johnson — so the vast majority of vaccines available in the U.S., if not all, remain unlicensed EUA products.  Here’s what you need to know when somebody orders you to get the vaccine:; Ask to see the vial. If it says “Comirnaty,” it’s a licensed product. If it says “Pfizer-BioNTech,” it’s an experimental product, and under 21 U.S. Code 360bbb, you have the right to refuse.  If it comes from Moderna or Johnson & Johnson (marketed as Janssen), you have the right to refuse.  The FDA is playing bait and switch with the American public — but we don’t have to play along. If it doesn’t say Comirnaty, you have not been offered an approved vaccine.

31d33510,"Though the whole world relies on RT-PCR to “diagnose” Sars-Cov-2 infection, the science is clear: they are not fit for purpose  Torsten Engelbrecht and Konstantin Demeter  Lockdowns and hygienic measures around the world are based on numbers of cases and mortality rates created by the so-called SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests used to identify “positive” patients, whereby “positive” is usually equated with “infected.”  But looking closely at the facts, the conclusion is that these PCR tests are meaningless as a diagnostic tool to determine an alleged infection by a supposedly new virus called SARS-CoV-2.  Unfounded “Test, test, test,…” mantra  At the media briefing on COVID-19 on March 16, 2020, the WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said:  We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test.”  The message was spread through headlines around the world, for instance by Reuters and the BBC.  Still on the 3 of May, the moderator of the heute journal — one of the most important news magazines on German television— was passing the mantra of the corona dogma on to his audience with the admonishing words:  Test, test, test—that is the credo at the moment, and it is the only way to really understand how much the coronavirus is spreading.”  This indicates that the belief in the validity of the PCR tests is so strong that it equals a religion that tolerates virtually no contradiction.  But it is well known that religions are about faith and not about scientific facts. And as Walter Lippmann, the two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and perhaps the most influential journalist of the 20th century said: “Where all think alike, no one thinks very much.”  So to start, it is very remarkable that Kary Mullis himself, the inventor of the Polymerase Chain Reaction PCR technology, did not think alike. His invention got him the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1993.  Unfortunately, Mullis passed away last year at the age of 74, but there is no doubt that the biochemist regarded the PCR as inappropriate to detect a viral infection.  The reason is that the intended use of the PCR was, and still is, to apply it as a manufacturing technique, being able to replicate DNA sequences millions and billions of times, and not as a diagnostic tool to detect viruses.  How declaring virus pandemics based on PCR tests can end in disaster was described by Gina Kolata in her 2007 New York Times article Faith in Quick Test Leads to Epidemic That Wasn’t.  Lack of a valid gold standard  Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the PCR tests used to identify so-called COVID-19 patients presumably infected by what is called SARS-CoV-2 do not have a valid gold standard to compare them with.  This is a fundamental point. Tests need to be evaluated to determine their preciseness — strictly speaking their “sensitivity”[1] and “specificity” — by comparison with a “gold standard,” meaning the most accurate method available.  As an example, for a pregnancy test the gold standard would be the pregnancy itself. But as Australian infectious diseases specialist Sanjaya Senanayake, for example, stated in an ABC TV interview in an answer to the question “How accurate is the [COVID-19] testing?”:  If we had a new test for picking up [the bacterium] golden staph in blood, we’ve already got blood cultures, that’s our gold standard we’ve been using for decades, and we could match this new test against that. But for COVID-19 we don’t have a gold standard test.”  Jessica C. Watson from Bristol University confirms this. In her paper “Interpreting a COVID-19 test result”, published recently in The British Medical Journal, she writes that there is a “lack of such a clear-cut ‘gold-standard’ for COVID-19 testing.”  But instead of classifying the tests as unsuitable for SARS-CoV-2 detection and COVID-19 diagnosis, or instead of pointing out that only a virus, proven through isolation and purification, can be a solid gold standard, Watson claims in all seriousness that, “pragmatically” COVID-19 diagnosis itself, remarkably including PCR testing itself, “may be the best available ‘gold standard’.” But this is not scientifically sound.  Apart from the fact that it is downright absurd to take the PCR test itself as part of the gold standard to evaluate the PCR test, there are no distinctive specific symptoms for COVID-19, as even people such as Thomas Löscher, former head of the Department of Infection and Tropical Medicine at the University of Munich and member of the Federal Association of German Internists, conceded to us[2].  And if there are no distinctive specific symptoms for COVID-19, COVID-19 diagnosis — contrary to Watson’s statement — cannot be suitable for serving as a valid gold standard.  In addition, “experts” such as Watson overlook the fact that only virus isolation, i.e. an unequivocal virus proof, can be the gold standard.  That is why I asked Watson how COVID-19 diagnosis “may be the best available gold standard,” if there are no distinctive specific symptoms for COVID-19, and also whether the virus itself, that is virus isolation, wouldn’t be the best available/possible gold standard. But she hasn’t answered these questions yet – despite multiple requests. And she has not yet responded to our rapid response post on her article in which we address exactly the same points, either, though she wrote us on June 2nd: “I will try to post a reply later this week when I have a chance.”  No proof for the RNA being of viral origin  Now the question is: What is required first for virus isolation/proof? We need to know where the RNA for which the PCR tests are calibrated comes from.  As textbooks e.g., White/Fenner. Medical Virology, 1986, p. 9 as well as leading virus researchers such as Luc Montagnier or Dominic Dwyer state, particle purification — i.e. the separation of an object from everything else that is not that object, as for instance Nobel laureate Marie Curie purified 100 mg of radium chloride in 1898 by extracting it from tons of pitchblende — is an essential pre-requisite for proving the existence of a virus, and thus to prove that the RNA from the particle in question comes from a new virus.  The reason for this is that PCR is extremely sensitive, which means it can detect even the smallest pieces of DNA or RNA — but it cannot determine where these particles came from. That has to be determined beforehand.  And because the PCR tests are calibrated for gene sequences in this case RNA sequences because SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be a RNA virus, we have to know that these gene snippets are part of the looked-for virus. And to know that, correct isolation and purification of the presumed virus has to be executed.  Hence, we have asked the science teams of the relevant papers which are referred to in the context of SARS-CoV-2 for proof whether the electron-microscopic shots depicted in their in vitro experiments show purified viruses.  But not a single team could answer that question with “yes” — and NB., nobody said purification was not a necessary step. We only got answers like “No, we did not obtain an electron micrograph showing the degree of purification” see below.  We asked several study authors “Do your electron micrographs show the purified virus?”, they gave the following responses:  Study 1: Leo L. M. Poon; Malik Peiris. “Emergence of a novel human coronavirus threatening human health” Nature Medicine, March 2020  Replying Author: Malik Peiris  Date: May 12, 2020  Answer: “The image is the virus budding from an infected cell. It is not purified virus.” Study 2: Myung-Guk Han et al. “Identification of Coronavirus Isolated from a Patient in Korea with COVID-19”, Osong Public Health and Research Perspectives, February 2020  Replying Author: Myung-Guk Han  Date: May 6, 2020  Answer: “We could not estimate the degree of purification because we do not purify and concentrate the virus cultured in cells.” Study 3: Wan Beom Park et al. “Virus Isolation from the First Patient with SARS-CoV-2 in Korea”, Journal of Korean Medical Science, February 24, 2020  Replying Author: Wan Beom Park  Date: March 19, 2020  Answer: “We did not obtain an electron micrograph showing the degree of purification.” Study 4: Na Zhu et al., “A Novel Coronavirus from Patients with Pneumonia in China”, 2019, New England Journal of Medicine, February 20, 2020  Replying Author: Wenjie Tan  Date: March 18, 2020  Answer: “[We show] an image of sedimented virus particles, not purified ones.”  Regarding the mentioned papers it is clear that what is shown in the electron micrographs EMs is the end result of the experiment, meaning there is no other result that they could have made EMs from.  That is to say, if the authors of these studies concede that their published EMs do not show purified particles, then they definitely do not possess purified particles claimed to be viral. In this context, it has to be remarked that some researchers use the term “isolation” in their papers, but the procedures described therein do not represent a proper isolation purification process. Consequently, in this context the term “isolation” is misused.  Thus, the authors of four of the principal, early 2020 papers claiming discovery of a new coronavirus concede they had no proof that the origin of the virus genome was viral-like particles or cellular debris, pure or impure, or particles of any kind. In other words, the existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is based on faith, not fact.  We have also contacted Dr Charles Calisher, who is a seasoned virologist. In 2001, Science published an “impassioned plea…to the younger generation” from several veteran virologists, among them Calisher, saying that:  [modern virus detection methods like] sleek polymerase chain reaction […] tell little or nothing about how a virus multiplies, which animals carry it, [or] how it makes people sick. [It is] like trying to say whether somebody has bad breath by looking at his fingerprint.”[3]  And that’s why we asked Dr Calisher whether he knows one single paper in which SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated and finally really purified. His answer:  I know of no such a publication. I have kept an eye out for one.”[4]  This actually means that one cannot conclude that the RNA gene sequences, which the scientists took from the tissue samples prepared in the mentioned in vitro trials and for which the PCR tests are finally being “calibrated,” belong to a specific virus — in this case SARS-CoV-2.  In addition, there is no scientific proof that those RNA sequences are the causative agent of what is called COVID-19.  In order to establish a causal connection, one way or the other, i.e. beyond virus isolation and purification, it would have been absolutely necessary to carry out an experiment that satisfies the four Koch’s postulates. But there is no such experiment, as Amory Devereux and Rosemary Frei recently revealed for OffGuardian.  The necessity to fulfill these postulates regarding SARS-CoV-2 is demonstrated not least by the fact that attempts have been made to fulfill them. But even researchers claiming they have done it, in reality, did not succeed.  One example is a study published in Nature on May 7. This trial, besides other procedures which render the study invalid, did not meet any of the postulates.  For instance, the alleged “infected” laboratory mice did not show any relevant clinical symptoms clearly attributable to pneumonia, which according to the third postulate should actually occur if a dangerous and potentially deadly virus was really at work there. And the slight bristles and weight loss, which were observed temporarily in the animals are negligible, not only because they could have been caused by the procedure itself, but also because the weight went back to normal again.  Also, no animal died except those they killed to perform the autopsies. And let’s not forget: These experiments should have been done before developing a test, which is not the case.  Revealingly, none of the leading German representatives of the official theory about SARS-Cov-2/COVID-19 — the Robert Koch-Institute RKI, Alexander S. Kekulé University of Halle, Hartmut Hengel and Ralf Bartenschlager German Society for Virology, the aforementioned Thomas Löscher, Ulrich Dirnagl Charité Berlin or Georg Bornkamm virologist and professor emeritus at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Munich — could answer the following question I have sent them:  If the particles that are claimed to be to be SARS-CoV-2 have not been purified, how do you want to be sure that the RNA gene sequences of these particles belong to a specific new virus?  Particularly, if there are studies showing that substances such as antibiotics that are added to the test tubes in the in vitro experiments carried out for virus detection can “stress” the cell culture in a way that new gene sequences are being formed that were not previously detectable — an aspect that Nobel laureate Barbara McClintock already drew attention to in her Nobel Lecture back in 1983.  It should not go unmentioned that we finally got the Charité – the employer of Christian Drosten, Germany’s most influential virologist in respect of COVID-19, advisor to the German government and co-developer of the PCR test which was the first to be “accepted” not validated! by the WHO worldwide – to answer questions on the topic.  But we didn’t get answers until June 18, 2020, after months of non-response. In the end, we achieved it only with the help of Berlin lawyer Viviane Fischer.  Regarding our question “Has the Charité convinced itself that appropriate particle purification was carried out?,” the Charité concedes that they didn’t use purified particles.  And although they claim “virologists at the Charité are sure that they are testing for the virus,” in their paper Corman et al. they state:  RNA was extracted from clinical samples with the MagNA Pure 96 system Roche, Penzberg, Germany and from cell culture supernatants with the viral RNA mini kit QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany,”  Which means they just assumed the RNA was viral.  Incidentally, the Corman et al. paper, published on January 23, 2020 didn’t even go through a proper peer review process, nor were the procedures outlined therein accompanied by controls — although it is only through these two things that scientific work becomes really solid.  Irrational test results  It is also certain that we cannot know the false positive rate of the PCR tests without widespread testing of people who certainly do not have the virus, proven by a method which is independent of the test having a solid gold standard.  Therefore, it is hardly surprising that there are several papers illustrating irrational test results.  For example, already in February the health authority in China’s Guangdong province reported that people have fully recovered from illness blamed on COVID-19, started to test “negative,” and then tested “positive” again.  A month later, a paper published in the Journal of Medical Virology showed that 29 out of 610 patients at a hospital in Wuhan had 3 to 6 test results that flipped between “negative”, “positive” and “dubious”.  A third example is a study from Singapore in which tests were carried out almost daily on 18 patients and the majority went from “positive” to “negative” back to “positive” at least once, and up to five times in one patient.  Even Wang Chen, president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, conceded in February that the PCR tests are “only 30 to 50 per cent accurate”; while Sin Hang Lee from the Milford Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory sent a letter to the WHO’s coronavirus response team and to Anthony S. Fauci on March 22, 2020, saying that:  It has been widely reported in the social media that the RT-qPCR [Reverse Transcriptase quantitative PCR] test kits used to detect SARSCoV-2 RNA in human specimens are generating many false positive results and are not sensitive enough to detect some real positive cases.”  In other words, even if we theoretically assume that these PCR tests can really detect a viral infection, the tests would be practically worthless, and would only cause an unfounded scare among the “positive” people tested.  This becomes also evident considering the positive predictive value PPV.  The PPV indicates the probability that a person with a positive test result is truly “positive” ie. has the supposed virus, and it depends on two factors: the prevalence of the virus in the general population and the specificity of the test, that is the percentage of people without disease in whom the test is correctly “negative” a test with a specificity of 95% incorrectly gives a positive result in 5 out of 100 non-infected people.  With the same specificity, the higher the prevalence, the higher the PPV.  In this context, on June 12 2020, the journal Deutsches Ärzteblatt published an article in which the PPV has been calculated with three different prevalence scenarios.  The results must, of course, be viewed very critically, first because it is not possible to calculate the specificity without a solid gold standard, as outlined, and second because the calculations in the article are based on the specificity determined in the study by Jessica Watson, which is potentially worthless, as also mentioned.  But if you abstract from it, assuming that the underlying specificity of 95% is correct and that we know the prevalence, even the mainstream medical journal Deutsches Ärzteblatt reports that the so-called SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests may have “a shockingly low” PPV.  In one of the three scenarios, figuring with an assumed prevalence of 3%, the PPV was only 30 percent, which means that 70 percent of the people tested “positive” are not “positive” at all. Yet “they are prescribed quarantine,” as even the Ärzteblatt notes critically.  In a second scenario of the journal’s article, a prevalence of rate of 20 percent is assumed. In this case they generate a PPV of 78 percent, meaning that 22 percent of the “positive” tests are false “positives.”  That would mean: If we take the around 9 million people who are currently considered “positive” worldwide — supposing that the true “positives” really have a viral infection — we would get almost 2 million false “positives.”  All this fits with the fact that the CDC and the FDA, for instance, concede in their files that the so-called “SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests” are not suitable for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.  In the “CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel“ file from March 30, 2020, for example, it says:  Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms”  And:  This test cannot rule out diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens.”  And the FDA admits that:  positive results […] do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.”  Remarkably, in the instruction manuals of PCR tests we can also read that they are not intended as a diagnostic test, as for instance in those by Altona Diagnostics and Creative Diagnostics[5].  To quote another one, in the product announcement of the LightMix Modular Assays produced by TIB Molbiol — which were developed using the Corman et al. protocol — and distributed by Roche we can read:  These assays are not intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of coronavirus infection”  And:  For research use only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.”  Where is the evidence that the tests can measure the “viral load”?  There is also reason to conclude that the PCR test from Roche and others cannot even detect the targeted genes.  Moreover, in the product descriptions of the RT-qPCR tests for SARS-COV-2 it says they are “qualitative” tests, contrary to the fact that the “q” in “qPCR” stands for “quantitative.” And if these tests are not “quantitative” tests, they don’t show how many viral particles are in the body.  That is crucial because, in order to even begin talking about actual illness in the real world not only in a laboratory, the patient would need to have millions and millions of viral particles actively replicating in their body.  That is to say, the CDC, the WHO, the FDA or the RKI may assert that the tests can measure the so-called “viral load,” i.e. how many viral particles are in the body. “But this has never been proven. That is an enormous scandal,” as the journalist Jon Rappoport points out.  This is not only because the term “viral load” is deception. If you put the question “what is viral load?” at a dinner party, people take it to mean viruses circulating in the bloodstream. They’re surprised to learn it’s actually RNA molecules.  Also, to prove beyond any doubt that the PCR can measure how much a person is “burdened” with a disease-causing virus, the following experiment would have had to be carried out which has not yet happened:  You take, let’s say, a few hundred or even thousand people and remove tissue samples from them. Make sure the people who take the samples do not perform the test.The testers will never know who the patients are and what condition they’re in. The testers run their PCR on the tissue samples. In each case, they say which virus they found and how much of it they found. Then, for example, in patients 29, 86, 199, 272, and 293 they found a great deal of what they claim is a virus. Now we un-blind those patients. They should all be sick, because they have so much virus replicating in their bodies. But are they really sick — or are they fit as a fiddle?  With the help of the aforementioned lawyer Viviane Fischer, I finally got the Charité to also answer the question of whether the test developed by Corman et al. — the so-called “Drosten PCR test” — is a quantitative test.  But the Charité was not willing to answer this question “yes”. Instead, the Charité wrote:  If real-time RT-PCR is involved, to the knowledge of the Charité in most cases these are […] limited to qualitative detection.”  Furthermore, the “Drosten PCR test” uses the unspecific E-gene assay as preliminary assay, while the Institut Pasteur uses the same assay as confirmatory assay.  According to Corman et al., the E-gene assay is likely to detect all Asian viruses, while the other assays in both tests are supposed to be more specific for sequences labelled “SARS-CoV-2”.  Besides the questionable purpose of having either a preliminary or a confirmatory test that is likely to detect all Asian viruses, at the beginning of April the WHO changed the algorithm, recommending that from then on a test can be regarded as “positive” even if just the E-gene assay which is likely to detect all Asian viruses! gives a “positive” result.  This means that a confirmed unspecific test result is officially sold as specific.  That change of algorithm increased the “case” numbers. Tests using the E-gene assay are produced for example by Roche, TIB Molbiol and R-Biopharm.  High Cq values make the test results even more meaningless  Another essential problem is that many PCR tests have a “cycle quantification” Cq value of over 35, and some, including the “Drosten PCR test”, even have a Cq of 45.  The Cq value specifies how many cycles of DNA replication are required to detect a real signal from biological samples.  “Cq values higher than 40 are suspect because of the implied low efficiency and generally should not be reported,” as it says in the MIQE guidelines.  MIQE stands for “Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments”, a set of guidelines that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating publications on Real-Time PCR, also called quantitative PCR, or qPCR.  The inventor himself, Kary Mullis, agreed, when he stated:  If you have to go more than 40 cycles to amplify a single-copy gene, there is something seriously wrong with your PCR.”  The MIQE guidelines have been developed under the aegis of Stephen A. Bustin, Professor of Molecular Medicine, a world-renowned expert on quantitative PCR and author of the book A-Z of Quantitative PCR which has been called “the bible of qPCR.”  In a recent podcast interview Bustin points out that “the use of such arbitrary Cq cut-offs is not ideal, because they may be either too low eliminating valid results or too high increasing false “positive” results.”  And, according to him, a Cq in the 20s to 30s should be aimed at and there is concern regarding the reliability of the results for any Cq over 35.  If the Cq value gets too high, it becomes difficult to distinguish real signal from background, for example due to reactions of primers and fluorescent probes, and hence there is a higher probability of false positives.  Moreover, among other factors that can alter the result, before starting with the actual PCR, in case you are looking for presumed RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, the RNA must be converted to complementary DNA cDNA with the enzyme Reverse Transcriptase—hence the “RT” at the beginning of “PCR” or “qPCR.”  But this transformation process is “widely recognized as inefficient and variable,” as Jessica Schwaber from the Centre for Commercialization of Regenerative Medicine in Toronto and two research colleagues pointed out in a 2019 paper.  Stephen A. Bustin acknowledges problems with PCR in a comparable way.  For example, he pointed to the problem that in the course of the conversion process RNA to cDNA the amount of DNA obtained with the same RNA base material can vary widely, even by a factor of 10 see above interview.  Considering that the DNA sequences get doubled at every cycle, even a slight variation becomes magnified and can thus alter the result, annihilating the test’s reliable informative value.  So how can it be that those who claim the PCR tests are highly meaningful for so-called COVID-19 diagnosis blind out the fundamental inadequacies of these tests—even if they are confronted with questions regarding their validity?  Certainly, the apologists of the novel coronavirus hypothesis should have dealt with these questions before throwing the tests on the market and putting basically the whole world under lockdown, not least because these are questions that come to mind immediately for anyone with even a spark of scientific understanding.  Thus, the thought inevitably emerges that financial and political interests play a decisive role for this ignorance about scientific obligations. NB, the WHO, for example has financial ties with drug companies, as the British Medical Journal showed in 2010.  And experts criticize “that the notorious corruption and conflicts of interest at WHO have continued, even grown“ since then. The CDC as well, to take another big player, is obviously no better off.  Finally, the reasons and possible motives remain speculative, and many involved surely act in good faith; but the science is clear: The numbers generated by these RT-PCR tests do not in the least justify frightening people who have been tested “positive” and imposing lockdown measures that plunge countless people into poverty and despair or even drive them to suicide.  And a “positive” result may have serious consequences for the patients as well, because then all non-viral factors are excluded from the diagnosis and the patients are treated with highly toxic drugs and invasive intubations. Especially for elderly people and patients with pre-existing conditions such a treatment can be fatal, as we have outlined in the article “Fatal Therapie.”  Without doubt eventual excess mortality rates are caused by the therapy and by the lockdown measures, while the “COVID-19” death statistics comprise also patients who died of a variety of diseases, redefined as COVID-19 only because of a “positive” test result whose value could not be more doubtful.  NOTES:- [1] Sensitivity is defined as the proportion of patients with disease in whom the test is positive; and specificity is defined as the proportion of patients without disease in whom the test is negative.

c3a1bd4e,"I hate science, evidently, because I’m woke to the manifest truth about what the leftist elite currently calls “climate change."" It is the second most staggering fraud ever perpetrated upon the American people after the media’s promotion of the unstoppable candidacy of Beto (who is a furry). Like some suckers still do, I once believed that “science” was a rigorous process where you tested theories and revised those theories in response to objective evidence. But in today’s shabby practice, “science” is just a package of self-serving lies buttressing the transnational liberal elite’s preferred narrative. Our alleged betters hope that labeling their propaganda “science” will science-shame you into silence about what everyone knows is a scam. Nah. “Climate change” is a hoax. Come arrest me for felony denial. Understand that the term “climate change” does not refer to actual meteorological phenomena but, rather, to the sordid rat-king of lies, scams and power grabs that we are commanded to accept as pagan gospel lest we burn to a crisp or drown or suffer...whatever the Armageddon du jour is. When you say “climate change is a grift,” and you should as often as possible, you are pointing out that this green-on-the-outside/red-on-the-inside fake frenzy is really just a set of intertwined grifts transparently designed to separate you from your freedom and your property in the name of somehow adjusting the weather. Observing that “climate change” is steaming garbage served in a dirty ashtray is not disputing that the climate changes. That the climate is not static, and never could be static, is one of the myriad reasons that this whole idea is ridiculous. The planet gets hotter, it gets colder, sometimes quickly, sometimes over eons, and there are a bunch of reasons why, like the sun and volcanos. Human-produced carbon might be one of the factors, but there’s simply no evidence that it is a significant one. Of course, if they really cared about carbon, they would be up in arms about China and India, which are upping their output while we are slashing ours. Yet the object of their ire is your New York strip. Gosh, does that seem consistent with 1) someone truly concerned about atmospheric carbon, or 2) someone who trembles with joy at the notion of bossing around you rubes out in gun/Jesusland? The underlying premise of their claims seems to be that there is a “right” temperature for the earth; watch them sputter when you enquire about that perfect setting for Earth’s thermostat. Remember, if you ask questions you hate “science.” If they did stop telling you how you hate “science” long enough to respond, they might explain that of course there’s no perfect temperature – it’s not like LA, where it’s always 72 degrees. But then, what are they comparing the present climate to in order to declare that our climate is “getting worse?” If you establish a climate baseline, then you can compare what’s actually happening to the baseline and that might demonstrate that the whole thing is baloney. That would be awkward. It happened after Katrina. Oh, Katrina’s proof positive that Gaia is really ticked off and…and…and…then we had a bunch of years without much hurricane action at all. You might think that this would be evidence that maybe the climate wasn’t in chaos, and that they would be happy to be proven wrong, but no, it doesn’t work that way. Every time the weather fits the narrative, you see, it’s proof that the climate kooks are right, and every time the weather fails to fit the narrative, well, weather’s not climate. At least until the next heat wave or storm; then weather will totally be climate again. Heads, you must give us all your freedom and money, and also tails, you must give us all your freedom and money. Now, we’re being told that we’re all going to die in…I guess we’re down to what? About 11.5 years this go ‘round? Of course, we’ve been told many times that we’re doomed and the deadlines have come and gone with the doomsdayers not missing a beat. They’re like old timey Elmer Gantrys promising the apocalypse over and over again, with their hardcore true believers regularly showing up for the rapture over and over again no matter how many times the Four Horseman fail to turn up. We haven’t even seen one horseman. Back in the 70s, I remember we were promised an ice age if we didn’t give liberals our money and freedom. Then in the 80s, we were promised death by ozone hole if we didn’t give liberals our money and freedom, and then doom by acid rain if we didn’t give liberals our money and freedom. By the time they started promising that we were all gonna die from global warming if we didn’t give liberals our money and freedom, I was still wanting my ice age. It would be nice to have a white Christmas in LA. So, where’s my damn ice age? Oh right, only a climate denier – Climate, I deny thee! – might wonder why we should hand over one, ten, a hundred trillion bucks to people who have never once been right about their predictions. You evidently hate “science” if you expect the “science” people to be correct at least one time in a half-century. And they’re not even good at short-term prognostication. Heck, for several days Hurricane Dorian was supposed to slam head on into Florida and then…it didn’t. The Obamas just bought a $15 million pad on the beach – what’s that say about their faith in “science?” But don’t worry, the guys batting .000 so far will definitely get the temperature in 2119 right if we only just write them a huge check and transform ourselves from citizens to serfs. That’s another big red flag – have you noticed how “science” always tells us that the only possible response to the climate hullabaloo is to give liberals exactly what they always wanted anyway? How lucky are the leftists to have had an existential problem drop in their laps where the only solution is to give them everything they could not otherwise convince us to give them? What a remarkable coincidence! And what’s also weird is how nothing that we must do right now no time to debate it’s a crisis think o’ the children in any way inconveniences or calls for sacrifices from our climate crisis-pushing elite. Boy, they really scored with climate change – if they were going to manufacture a crisis in order to get the power and money they craved, how would they do it any differently? Now, they might claim that they too will have to sacrifice to the Angry Weather Demon, but it’s unclear how. I suppose they might stop flying across the globe to climate finger-wagging festivals in private jets, but call me jaded for thinking that if it’s such a crisis today and they have not stopped doing it yet, they won’t stop jetting about down the road. Oh, but you will. You most definitely will stop flying and driving the vehicles you choose and eating cheeseburgers and using straws that don’t disintegrate into gummy sludge in your Dr. Pepper. But them? Pete Buttigieg explained away his zipping around in Gulfstreams as necessary because it is important for him to be pestering people in Des Moines. Bet you that pretty much everything our betters want to do will turn out to be “important.” And I’ll bet that nothing what you peasants want to do will. One might think that if stopping carbon was important, you might want to explore nuclear power. But you would think wrong. After all, if there’s plenty of electrical power, the elite loses the political power that comes from divvying up a scarce resource. If they control the power, they control you. Cheap, plentiful power makes you freer, which is a bug, not a feature. Oh, and those many millions of people in Middle America who directly or indirectly rely on fracking and the rest of the fossil fuel industry? Even bloody-eyed, Gaffe-atronic Joe 3000 wants to shaft you. Better learn to code or something, because your good job is history. Weird how all the sacrifice once again falls on those out in the hinterlands and not on the blue coastal city swells, huh? But you’ll be able to rest easy knowing that our moral superiors in Brooklyn and Alexandria and Santa Monica enjoyed showing you sweaty rubes who’s really the boss by impoverishing you. Because that, and not the weather in a century, is and always has been what the “climate change” hoax is really all about.

People you despise for being cruise-shilling grifter dweebs called these tomes “appalling.” Can there be a greater endorsement?","The Liberal Democrats have devoted a great deal of time at their party conference to attacking my predecessor as Witney MP, David Cameron, over his decision to call the EU referendum. These attacks are an attempt to sanitise their own role in campaigning for – and to airbrush their contribution to securing – that very referendum.

Let’s get some of the basics clear first. The Conservative manifesto promise to hold an in/out referendum was endorsed by the British people in 2015, being crucial to the party’s majority at that year’s general election. The very fact that the British public voted to Leave a year later demonstrates how wide and deep was discontent in Britain at the country’s EU membership, at least without fundamental reform. Ever since the advent of the euro, and the further integration required to sustain it, Britain and the EU were on different paths requiring at the very least a fundamentally reformed relationship. Cameron is correct that a referendum was, at some point, probably inevitable in any event.

We should not forget: the referendum was not called by Cameron alone. Even as Prime Minister, he did not have the authority to simply call the referendum. That required an Act of Parliament, which passed by an overwhelming majority with 544 MPs in favour and just 53 against at Second Reading. As it happened, seven of the Lib Dems’ then eight MPs voted for the EU Referendum Bill in 2015.

But the Lib Dems’ hypocrisy does not end there. For all the vitriol they pour on Cameron for holding the referendum, the Lib Dems neglect to mention that they were calling for an in/out referendum on the EU many years before the Conservative Party. Indeed, we have all seen the infamous 2008 Lib Dem campaign leaflet circulating on Twitter – very familiar to those of us who were Conservative activists at the time – featuring a fresh-faced Nick Clegg demanding “a real referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union.” The leaflet observed that:

“It’s been over thirty years since the British people last had a vote on Britain’s membership of the European Union. That’s why the Liberal Democrats want a real referendum on Europe. Only a real referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU will let the people decide our country’s future.”

2008 was also the year that Clegg infamously stormed out of the House of Commons when the then speaker, Michael Martin, refused to call a Lib Dem amendment in his name demanding an in/out EU referendum.

Following Ed Davey’s expulsion from the chamber, Clegg said:

“I share the dismay of [Ed Davey]. What guidance can [the Deputy Speaker] give me on how we can secure – if not today, at some point during the remaining stages of the Bill – the opportunity to debate the issue that many members want debated and many members of the public want debated: our future membership of the EU?”

Davey (then the Lib Dems’ foreign affairs spokesman) had struck an even more forceful tone, remarking:

“Will the Chair reconsider the decision not to select the Liberal Democrat amendment for a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU? That is the question that goes to the heart of the debate before the House. That is the debate that people want to hear. We are being gagged, Sir.”

The current Lib Dem Leader, Jo Swinson, also contributed to this debate, and her speech is fascinating when compared with the comments she made at the weekend. Swinson repeated that:

“The Liberal Democrats would like to have a referendum on the major issue of whether we are in or out of Europe.”

On an in/out EU referendum, she noted:

“We support such a referendum; we will continue to campaign for it and hope that it will find favour in this House.”

Furthermore, she described being denied a vote on Clegg’s referendum amendment as “incredibly disappointing” and something she felt “very passionately” about.

Swinson’s eurosceptic side – mysteriously neglected of late – was also on display, as she noted:

“For too long, power in the EU has been concentrated among those who are appointed, not elected. The structures of the EU have often proved cumbersome to say the least, at times even making this House look modern and streamlined by comparison.”

The Lib Dems remained proponents of an in/out referendum at the 2010 General Election which saw them enter into a Coalition Government with the Conservatives, with a carefully caveated manifesto promise to hold a referendum “the next time a British government signs up for fundamental change in the relationship between the UK and the EU”.

The fact that the Lib Dems long advocated giving the British people a say on our membership of the EU, and indeed were the first mainstream party to call for an in/out referendum on the matter, makes their new pledge to cancel Brexit without even a second referendum all the more extraordinary. And that, itself, being an evolution from a position that a second referendum result would only be respected if it resulted in a Remain vote.

Seemingly without a hint of self-awareness, Lib Dem party policy is now to ignore the result of a referendum for which they themselves were the first to call. This wildly divisive policy shows the Lib Dems to be utterly disinterested in bringing the country together, their uncompromising approach only serving to fuel further discord and division. There is nothing inherently wrong with regretting a referendum result, but it is deluded to think that pretending it didn’t happen is going to lead to anything other than bitter polarisation.

It is therefore no surprise that Lib Dem grandee Sir Norman Lamb has warned that the party is “playing with fire”, describing the new policy as “a threat to the social contract” that risks dividing an already fractured country further.

Let’s be clear: nullifying a referendum for which the Lib Dems were the first to call, which was overwhelmingly endorsed by Parliament and which was the largest democratic exercise in our nation’s history, is not a moderate position. Neither liberal, nor democrats, this party has become the truly extremist force in British politics.",false,

They have undocumented citizens cast votes for them, they have dead people vote for them, have people of color vote for them, and the list goes on and on.  No, they have sunk to a new low. Nancy Pelosi and her cronies seek to disrespect our troops even more than they have thus far through defunding and constant criticism of heroic acts. Pelosi announced today that she intends to bring forth a new bill that would disqualify members of the military who serve overseas from voting in the coming presidential election.  Most people automatically assumed that this was being proposed in response to Trump’s opposition to mail-in voting. A tit-for-tat situation. Pelosi knows that 95 percent of military personnel support Trump and saw an opportunity to eliminate those votes. The truth is actually much more sinister.  The announcement was met with snark and outrage from her Republican counterparts who called Pelosi an unAmerican fascist communist totalitarian Russian trader. The Speaker of the House was quick to respond:  “Voting is a privilege for Americans who will be affected by the decisions of the elected. Republicans have pointed this out to us many times. So I’m just playing along. Some of these young men and women have been out of country for years. Why should they get to vote? They don’t even live here. We need to strengthen our elections, not weaken them by allowing foreigners to participate. That’s essentially what these soldiers have become- foreigners.

3c2b01de,"Earlier today, the Trump administration released its plans to vaccine everyone in a short time. Three potential vaccines are currently in Stage 3 trials in the United States and could be ready in weeks, President Donald Trump said Tuesday.  Time is running out. And Trump has the military lined up and ready to distribute this vaccine to the public, whether you want it or not. The plan is to distribute the vaccine first to health care and other vital workers, as well as those most vulnerable likely the older populations. After production ramps up, it will be made available to all Americans who want it. If you decide you don’t want it, don’t worry, the military will help convince you.  The Department of Defense and federal health agencies have outlined plans for a coronavirus vaccine, which includes having them available for free for all Americans. We have warned that the DoD is about to become the enemy of the public. Instead of committing terrorism abroad, they will be going that here. Prepare yourself.  The Pentagon & CDC Will Join Together To Mass Distribute The COVID Vaccine  This toxic concoction will also be “free.” The government says they will foot the bill borrow money from the Federal Reserve to get everyone vaccinated, according to the Watauga Democrat.  “Preparing for the implementation of the safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccine programs is a critical next step in the efforts to protect Americans and reduce the impact of COVID-19 and restore our normal way of life,” Centers for Disease Control and Director Dr. Robert Redfield said Wednesday, according to CNN.  The plans came in the form of a report to Congress and a “playbook” for states and local governments, according to the Associated Press and Fox News. The agencies are looking at January for a potential beginning of a vaccination campaign, although it remains possible that this could come later this year.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s playbook, the vaccination campaign will be “much larger in scope and complexity than seasonal influenza or other previous outbreak-related vaccination responses.”  President Trump said in a “Fox & Friends” interview Tuesday that a vaccine could be approved “in a matter of weeks.”  Time is almost up. Once this vaccine gets into your bloodstream, you cannot take it back out. This one is different from every other vaccine made, and it’s going to be necessary if you want to get groceries or leave your house.

,"On Monday afternoon, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo learned his fate, having been held responsible for the needless deaths of thousands of senior citizens who perished during the first wave of a largely manufactured global plandemic. He was sentenced to death after a 3-officer panel at Guantanamo Bay heard testimony from former members of Cuomo’s staff, nursing home and hospice employees, and the worker of a freight company who claimed Cuomo had threatened to bankrupt the company unless it converted 18-wheelers into a fleet of roving freezers and crematoriums.  From the moment he entered the courtroom, Cuomo was combative, belligerent, and argumentative, hurling obscenities at both Rear Adm. Darse E. Crandall and the panel chosen to weigh the merits of the military’s case against him. He admonished the Office of Military Commissions, calling it an affront to the criminal justice system and the “American way of life.”  “Never in my gubernatorial career or my years as a lawyer have I seen such a fucking miscarriage of justice. You people are really pieces of shit,” Cuomo said during a brief opening statement.  The brevity of his argument was not by choice. Had he the chance, Cuomo would have castigated the court until his voice went hoarse. But Rear Adm. Crandall quickly put an end to Cuomo’s theatrics and shenanigans by instructing GITMO security to gag his mouth and shackle his ankles to a chair.  “We have zero tolerance for staginess and theatricality in this chamber,” Rear Adm. Crandall said. “The witnesses will be heard.”  The first witness to appear on ZOOM was a woman named Michelle Steiger, a former administrator at the Cobble Hill Health Center in Brooklyn. She testified that on March 26, 2020, the facility received a sudden influx of alleged Covid-19 patients, 65 in all, from area hospitals, even though the senior living facility had enough beds to accommodate less than half that amount.  Ms. Steiger: We were told the patients had Covid-19 and ordered to take them into our facility  Rear Adm. Crandall: Ordered how?  Ms. Steiger: We received documents signed by Andrew Cuomo and the health commissioner, Howard Zucker, saying that they’d pull state funding unless we accepted all Covid-19 patients sent to us. Few of our existing patients had tested positive, and of the first 65 they sent us, only 7 were positive for Covid-19. But we were told to say they all had Covid-19, because we’d be better financially compensated, even in the absence of a positive PCR test. We were told to falsify medical records, to say people who didn’t have Covid-19 had it. And to expect a new group of patients every week.  Rear Adm. Crandall: But Cobble Hill Health had no room for that many more patients?  Ms. Steiger: That’s correct. In another correspondence, we were told not to worry about that because a pickup was to be arranged each week to remove existing Covid patients and replace them with new ones.  Rear Adm. Crandall: Replace them? Had they died—of Covid-19?  Ms. Steiger: I’m unaware of any patient dying from or with Covid-19. In our environment, people die, yes, of heart attacks and non-Covid respiratory ailments. But we were told to code all deaths as Covid fatalities.  Rear Adm. Crandall: I see. Certainly not all patients in your ward suddenly dropped dead. What happened to the ones who were alive to make room for new patients the hospitals sent to you?  Ms. Steiger: For the live ones, trucks, like the ones that haul frozen goods across the country, arrived every other week or so, and the patients were taken and placed in the trucks. I don’t know where they went or what happened after that, but these were old and frail people, and there’s no way they survived long in refrigerated trucks.  Rear Adm. Crandall: And the patients who had expired, for whatever reason.  Ms. Steiger: Different kinds of trucks, fitted with furnaces. The bodies were hurled into them.  Rear Adm. Crandall: Didn’t you realize the criminality of your actions and participation, Ms. Steiger?”  Ms. Steiger: Of course. But I—we—were afraid, afraid of losing our jobs and of other things. One staff member who threatened to go to the press was told CPS would take her children if she didn’t keep quiet and follow instructions.  Rear Adm. Crandall: One last question. Why transport people from hospitals to nursing homes at all? Why wouldn’t he just have had these alleged Covid patients picked up at the hospitals?  Ms. Steiger: I could only speculate.  Rear Adm. Crandall: The tribunal will indulge your speculation given that you’ve spent 25 years working in the facilities, but the officers are instructed to not consider your statement as evidence.  Ms. Steiger: Hospitals are enormous institutions with thousands of people, most of them pretty healthy. If someone did have Covid, there’d be a risk of the infection spreading across all the staff and patients. Hospital acquired infection is a leading cause of death in hospitals. The infirmed at nursing homes are very old and very sick and don’t have much life left in them. I guess it was no big deal if they died.”  Rear Adm. Crandall: Finally, did you receive any compensation for going along with this agenda?  Ms. Steiger: I did not.  Rear Adm. Crandall excused the witness and slid documents onto the table behind which the 3-officer panel was seated. The papers bore the signatures of Andrew Cuomo and Howard Zucker. One, which Cuomo had sent to 8 nursing homes in lower New York State, instructed staff to “assume patients were Covid-19 positive regardless of test results if they exhibited even a single symptom of the illness,” such as coughing, sneezing, wheezing, or shortness of breath.  “We cannot jeopardize the health of the general population. All patients exhibiting symptoms of Covid-19 should presumptively be considered to have it unless directed otherwise by New York State Health and Human Services,” Cuomo or Zucker had written.  After a brief recess, Rear Adm. Crandall introduced the next witness, Marco Miranda, a former driver for Brooklyn-based freight carrier BZC. He said he had been employed with BZC for 15 years and had spent most of that time hauling produce between the United States in Canada. In March of 2020, however, the company had given him new instructions.  Rear Adm Crandall: Mr. Miranda, in your deposition you said you were one of several drivers who picked up patients at Cobble Hill Health Center, is that correct?  Mr. Miranda: Cobble Hill and other places.  Rear Adm. Crandall: And that operating on instructions given by BZC, you moved patients from those facilities into refrigerated tract—”  Mr. Miranda: I didn’t move nobody. The staff at those places moved them and put’em in the truck. Me and my partner just did the driving, that’s all.”  Rear Adm. Crandall: But you can confirm they were alive when placed in the vehicle?”  Mr. Miranda: Oh, yeah, they were breathing all right. Some of them even flailed their arms and the nursing home people sedated them for transport.  Rear Adm. Crandall: How were they stored?  Mr. Miranda: Bunks, cots, 3-high were installed on either side of the trailer. They were put there and strapped down.  Rear Adm. Crandall: What is the temperature inside a refrigerated trailer?  Mr. Miranda: Oh, it’s like your fridge at home, we can dial up or dial down the temp, anywhere from 65 to -20 Fahrenheit. We were told to bottom out the thermostat.  Rear Adm. Crandall: Did you know that the persons inside, who were alive, would not survive long in those temperatures?  Mr. Miranda: Wasn’t my business. I did what I was told. Look, man, you didn’t cross the Cuomo brothers—if you did, bad shit would happen to you and your family. I have a wife and 3 kids to think about.  Rear Adm. Crandall: So you’re saying with certitude that Cuomo was behind the orders?  Mr. Miranda: We knew who was calling the shots.  Rear Adm. Crandall: Where were the patients taken?  Mr. Miranda: There was a mass grave site dug on Hart Island. We drove to City Island, and people was waiting to unload the bodies and put’em on a ferry to Hart. I never touched a single one of them. All I did was drive.  Rear Adm. Crandall: In your deposition, you said you saw Cuomo at the unloading site, is that correct?  Mr. Miranda. I saw the bastard. Even snapped a pic on my phone.  Rear Adm. Crandall entered into evidence a photograph of Andrew Cuomo standing beside six men in HAZMAT suits who were unloading frozen corpses from the trailer and moving them onto the ferry.  Rear Adm. Crandall: Just a few more questions. Ballpark figure, how many persons did you transport between March and September of 2020.  Mr. Miranda: Thousands. And we wasn’t the only one. We had five trucks going all the time.  Rear Adm. Crandall: And were you promised anything in return for your testimony today?  Mr. Miranda: No. I know what we did was wrong. But we were scared. Like I said, you don’t fuck with the Cuomo brothers. I just pray God forgives me.  The last witness to appear was none other than Melissa DeRosa, who had been Cuomo’s principal ally, aide, and mouthpiece. She resigned her position after many women accused the former governor of sexual harassment. She provided to the Office of Military Commissions countless papers and electronic files that corroborated the testimony of earlier witnesses.  Rear Adm. Crandall: Mrs. DeRosa, we know you’re reluctant to speak here today, but can you say as fact that your former employer, Andrew Cuomo, seated before us here today, did indeed profit from the actions he’s alleged to have taken and that he did so to foster an agenda—that agenda being to artificially amplify the threat Covid-19?  Mrs. DeRosa: Yes, I can testify to that. The documents I’ve provided spell it all out.  Rear Adm. Crandall: And do you know as fact that Andrew Cuomo is responsible for the murders of thousands of senior citizens who might otherwise be alive today were it not for his actions?  Mrs. DeRosa: Tens of thousands.  Rear Adm. Crandall: Were you afraid of Cuomo?  Mrs. DeRosa: Terrified.  After excusing the witness, Rear Adm. Crandall instructed the tribunal to carefully read the documents and to thoroughly consider the testimony it had heard. The panel sequestered itself in an antechamber and deliberated for three hours before returning a verdict of guilty on all counts, recommending that Andrew Cuomo be hanged for his crimes.  An execution date is pending.  (Visited 225,573 times, 8 visits today)",Military Convicts Andrew Cuomo,false,54688712778267922348610211453294770038

“I have invoked the Insurrection Act of 1807 (Section 10 U.S. Code 13 251-255) to address the treasonous rebellion conducted by Democrat and Republican lawmakers, CCP Agents (Chinese Communist Party), FBI, Department of Justice, CIA and others to dismantle the United States of America and it’s Constitution,” President Trump declared on Thursday 14 Jan. “These entities pose a direct threat to national security. I will remain President indefinitely until all domestic enemies are arrested.” President Trump invoked the Insurrection Act after another assassination attempt on him last Sat. morning 9 Jan. According to his Intel, Chinese Communist Party Agents, the FBI, Department of Justice, CIA and others of the Deep State have – with the help of the Main Stream Media – long been planning to dismantle the US and it’s Constitution. Of course, none of these treasonous acts have been reported by the corrupt Main Stream Media. Trump had evidence that the MSM was “embedded with CIA and Chinese Communist Party agents whose sole purpose was to direct public opinion toward a Deep State agenda.” President Trump invoked the Insurrection Act after another assassination attempt on him last Sat. morning 9 Jan.

Of course, none of these treasonous acts have been reported by the corrupt Main Stream Media. Trump had evidence that the MSM was “embedded with CIA and Chinese Communist Party agents whose sole purpose was to direct public opinion toward a Deep State agenda.” By law with the Insurrection Act in effect, Trump would remain President indefinitely until all domestic enemies were arrested. He would soon take down the Main Stream Media. “I’m drafting an Executive Order to take the following propaganda media outlets off the airwaves: ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC. I am also working with the FCC to pull their licenses. We have evidence that all of these media organizations employ agents of the Chinese Communist Party as well as embedded CIA Agents whose sole purpose is to brainwash, hypnotize and direct public opinion toward certain agendas that support the Left and Deep State. These organizations are a threat to national security and virtually nothing they report is actual news.” It’s no small task to take down the Cabal. Military and Special Forces units have been deploying all over the US in 400+ cities. Right now there were over 15,000 troops in DC according to Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy. Special Forces units have covertly infiltrated Antifa and Black Lives Matter and made silent covert arrests. That same Sat. 9 Jan. POTUS and the Department of Defense postponed the 20 Jan. Presidential Inauguration. Intel sources claimed that if Joe Biden was not inaugurated there were corrupt-FBI plans to help stage Antifa and BLM violence in DC and at the 50 state capitols from Sat 16 Jan. through Wed. 20 Jan. Biden couldn’t be inaugurated anyway because of the Insurrection Act that demanded Trump remain in office “until all domestic enemies were arrested.” HENX - Light Years Beyond Colloidal Silver! Protect Your Family! A corrupt Mass Media has refused to report anything but their Left Wing agenda believed paid for by the CCP. Thus, the President has announced he would soon activate the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS). This was expected during what has been referred to as Ten Days of Darkness, or media outage. With the EBS everyone would get alerts on their phones, TV, radio and Internet that would override other broadcasts for several hours at a time. The broadcasts would explain the silent war happening across the globe between the Cabal and Alliance.This week Trump Intel providers Robert David Steele and Juan OSavin explained, “This may not be settled until April 1. Anyone including Fox, who refuses to broadcast the President of the US faces loss of their FCC licenses as well as criminal punitive actions, perhaps a military takeover.” On Wed. 13 Jan. in an urgent message to the American people President Trump called for peace. Intel sources were reporting that riots were planned in DC and across the nation. He condemned the rioters at the state capitol, as well as a recent assault by Social Media on our Freedom of Speech and then activated military forces to quell unrest. The recent violation of Social Media platforms to censor Freedom of Speech was of concern. Donald Trump Jr. to the rescue. Trump Jr. announced that a new social media platform was coming soon called the Freedom Social Network. More important, President Trump had officially shut down the Cabal’s USA Inc. and re-started a restored Republic on 4 July 2020. It was all a part of the Alliance’s Plan to free the globe of the Communist Parties /Cabal’s suppression of The People. “The Plan To Save The World”: As part of that plan President Trump’s Space Force has been involved in worldwide blackouts in multiple countries as Alliance Special Force units made arrests. Overnight to Sun. 10 Jan. multiple arrests were conducted, including in Frankfurt Germany – home of the CIA office where Dominion Voting machines illegally changed Trump votes to Biden in the 2020 Election. Over last weekend French and Russia Alliance military leaders’ Special Force units took out Deep Staters in Italy, Pakistan, Berlin and Paris. By the first of the week they had moved to Iran where they caused Blackouts in order to target global and regional terrorism. By Tues. 12 Jan. the White House had launched the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office. This officially activated Space Force and it’s Quantum Computer that would put us and the world on the Gold Standard, provide a transparent and instantaneous Quantum Voting System for our first Restored Republic Election in March 2021, plus provided the platform for a top secret Global Broadcast Satellite Program that could override all TV screens for President Trump’s worldwide addresses.

,"Tensions mounted Friday morning between the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps and attorneys scheduled to represent former President George W. Bush, with the latter requesting a continuance to gather exculpatory evidence.  Counselors of the law firm Williams & Conolly arrived at Guantanamo Bay Friday, five days ahead of Bush’s tribunal date, arguing that the military had given them inadequate time to prepare a defense. Senior Counsel David D. Aufhauser asserted Bush’s innocence but demanded an additional 90 days to prepare a rebuttal to, what he called, the military’s specious allegations. Moreover, they said JAG’s seizure of documents and electronic devices from Bush’s Crawford ranch violated his 4th Amendment rights, and, therefore, ought to be inadmissible in courts of law.  Lt. Dawn Cusumano, a junior member of JAG’s National Security Litigation team, noted that Bush’s arrest took place on 11 November, giving his legal team nearly a month to mount a defense, and asked why, if Bush were innocent, they needed three more months.  “Because your office has fabricated flagrantly bogus charges on our client,” Aufhauser said.  “Mr. Aufhauser, if you’re prepared to accuse our offices of manufacturing evidence to wrongfully prosecute your client, well, those are serious allegations, ones you should be prepared to back up. Rear Adm. Crandall is patient, but he doesn’t tolerate foolery,” Lt. Cusumano said.  Aufhauser wanted to know why JAG hadn’t shared its discovery file with the defense team.  “This is not a civilian court; it’s a military commission. We’re not obligated to, and what we have shared, we’ve done for professional courtesy,” Lt. Cusumano replied.  Aufhauser then asked to speak with Rear Adm. Crandall, saying he felt personally slighted because JAG had sent “only a lieutenant” to evaluate his request.  Lt. Cusumano excused herself from the conference room, telling Aufhauser she’d make a phone call, only to return a minute later with Rear Adm. Crandall’s response.  Request denied.  “This is outrageous,” Aufhauser barked, “we’ll see him in court.”  Bush’s tribunal will commence at GITMO on Wednesday morning.  (Visited 3 times, 3 visits today)",George W.

,"Footage has emerged of Dr Tedros, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, claiming countries are intentionally giving booster shots of the Covid-19 vaccine to children to kill them.  Tedros was speaking at the hybrid press conference with Geneva based Palais des Nations journalists held on Monday 20th December 2021 when he made the following remarks –  “So if it’s going to be used (the Covid-19 vaccine) it’s better to focus on those groups of severe disease and death, rather as we see some countries are using to give boosters to kill children, this is not right.”  The strange slip comes after Dr Tedros was recorded speaking with Brazil’s President, Jair Bolsonaro, at the G20 summit in Rome in which he confirmed that the Covid-19 vaccines are incapable of preventing infection and transmission of the virus, that the WHO does not support the use of Vaccine Passports as they are discriminatory, and the WHO does not recommend children are giving the experimental jab.  It is unclear whether Tedros meant to state that countries are deliberately killing children with booster shots of the Covid-19 vaccines, or whether it was just a slip of the tongue. But the Director-General of the WHO did not correct himself, and there is plenty of evidence that the Covid-19 injections are causing life threatening events, permanent disabilities, and deaths among children.  An investigation of data found in the USA’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), found that up to November 5th 2021, the Pfizer Covid-19 injection had caused 16,880 adverse events, 5,161 emergency room visits, 1,365 hospitalisations, 264 life threatening events, 120 permanent disabilities, and 29 deaths among children between the ages of 6 and 17.  Here are a few examples of the specific reports of deaths among children occurring due to the Covid-19 vaccine –  A 16-year-old female received the Pfizer vaccine on the 19th March 2021. Nine days later the same female went into cardiac arrest at home. By the 30th March 2021 she had sadly died.  A 15-year-old female suffered cardiac arrest and ended up in intensive care four days after having the Moderna mRNA jab. She also sadly died.  A 15-year-old female received her second dose of the Pfizer jab on the 6th June 2021. Sadly one day later she died suddenly without reason.  A 15-year-old male had the Pfizer mRNA jab. One day later he suffered heart failure and sadly died.  Evidence from data published by the Office for National Statistics on deaths in England and Wales, also shows that since all children over the age of 12 were offered the Covid-19 vaccine deaths among kids have increased significantly against the five-year-average.  The following chart shows the cumulative number of deaths per week, between week 38 and week 45, among all children aged 10-14 in England and Wales in 2021, and the 2015-2019 5-year-average dataset.  Between week 38 and week 45 in the five-year-average dataset, a total of 41 deaths among children aged 10-14 occurred. But during the same time frame this year a total of 59 deaths have occurred among children according to the 2021 dataset. This represents a 44% increase on the five-year-average since they were offered a Covid-19 injection.  There can be no doubt that after two years the official data proves that children do not suffer serious disease due to Covid-19, let alone die with it.  So whether Tedros meant to state that countries are intentionally killing children with Booster shots of the Covid jabs, or it was a slip of the tongue, he is still quite correct that if they are going to administer the injections to anybody at all then it should be the most vulnerable and not children.  “So if it’s going to be used (the Covid-19 vaccine) it’s better to focus on those groups of severe disease and death, rather as we see some countries are using to give boosters to kill children, this is not right.”","BREAKING – Director-General of the WHO claims “Countries are giving Boosters to kill children, this is not right”",false,17061664237497551788510926774046859803

Experts looked at data on 22,332 confirmed deaths in England since March 31, when pre-existing conditions began to be reported, and found 5,873 were suffering from diabetes. Dementia was the second most common condition linked with COVID mortality, affecting 18 percent of confirmed cases. But just seven percent of patients who died from the respiratory disease had asthma.  The breakdown comes as coronavirus fatalities in the UK rose to 33,614 after 428 more deaths were recorded in the last 24 hours. A total of 233,151 people have now tested positive for the bug across Britain - up 3,446 from yesterday. The death toll refers to those who have died in all settings – including hospitals, care homes, hospices and the community. Around four million Britons are affected by diabetes.  People with the illness have been told they are at higher risk from the pandemic and are being urged to stay indoors as much as possible. Professor Partha Kar, a national speciality advisor for diabetes for the NHS, said: “It is clear that people with diabetes are more at risk of dying from COVID-19 and more detailed analysis is currently underway to understand the link between the two. Initial findings indicate that the threat in people under 40 continues to be very low. “The NHS has put extra measures in place so that people living with diabetes can manage their condition better during the pandemic.  It includes a range of online services, video consultations with your local clinical team and a dedicated helpline for those who need advice.” A separate government survey revealed yesterday that up to 222,000 people in England may be infected with the coronavirus right now. The first round of random tests of 10,000 members of the public has identified only 33 positive cases of COVID-19 and estimated a national infection level of 0.27 percent – one in every 370 people. This suggests that 148,000 people had the virus at any given time between April 27 and May 10, with the official estimate ranging from 94,000 to 222,000. During that time 66,343 people were officially diagnosed.  And the rate of infection is six times higher in healthcare workers and carers than it is in the general population, the survey found. While 1.33 percent of people who worked in patient-facing roles in hospitals or homes tested positive for the virus, only 0.22 percent of those with other jobs did so. The numbers did not include anyone who was tested in a care home or a hospital, where the statisticians said rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be higher. The 33 people who tested positive came from 30 different households, suggesting they either lived alone or most had managed not to infect the people they lived with.",Diabetes warning: More than THIRD of COVID-19 hospital deaths had disease,false,

Experts say this renders the scheme technically useless as it is designed for those who are struggling to find the initial outlay involved in buying a home and means they will still be reliant on loans from their parents, if available.","Help to Buy Isa scandal: 500,000 first-time buyers told scheme cannot be used for initial deposit on homes",false,
97b3e15c,"Denying 2000 years of the Medieval Warm Period, Little Ice Age on every continent Here we go again. For five or so years believers didn’t really mention the Medieval Warm Period. Too bruised by the embarrassment of Hockey Stick Zombie failures. But it’s an inconvenient era they have to rub out because none of the expert models can explain what caused it, and it’s hard to panic about same temperatures that Edward the Confessor survived with oxen and carts. And it’s hard to call the modern warmth “man-made” if nature created something just like it 1,000 years ago. By Michael Collett, ABC, Environmental Copy and Paste Promoter Climate scientists writing in the journal Nature have found there is no evidence for “globally coherent warm and cold periods” over the past 2,000 years prior to industrialisation. That’s significant, because climate change deniers have sometimes pointed to epochs like the so-called “Little Ice Age” or “Medieval Warm Period” to argue that the current global warming is one among multiple similar global climate events. But what the research actually shows is that other “peak warming and cooling events” over the past two millennia appear to have been localised, whereas the human-caused global warming observed over the past 150 years is unparalleled in its global scale (not to mention its absolute temperatures). Who’s denying a million raw data points? This new global temperature reconstruction by The Pages Consortium miraculously agrees with the models yet disagrees with hundreds of stalagmites, corals, ice cores, trees, lake sediments, mud from the ocean floor, pollen dust and 6,000 boreholes. It disagrees with the history of peoples like the Vikings. It disagrees with plants that grew and with trees that survived “above the snowline” that shouldn’t. This map shows just some temperature estimates from all around the world during medieval times relative to today. Many of these papers come from Craig Idso at CO2Science.org who maintains the Medieval Warm Period Project. Back in 2009 when I did this map for the Skeptics Handbook II it was a first. Even then, there were already 442 separate research institutes from 41 countries which had published papers showing the MWP.* Also thanks to Luning and Vahrenholt, and the team at NoTricksZone. The latest paper is trying to claim that all these temperatures were not recorded at the same time and that it wasn’t global. But when proxies are combined it’s obvious it was. Even in our modern warm period, there are still warm and cold records being set at the same time. Medieval times were no different. It’s only by collating and combining many proxies that we can see “the average”. 18 proxies tell us the world was the same or warmer 1,000 years ago Craig Loehle in 2008 used 18 non-tree-ring proxies which included Greenland borehole data, Conroy lake pollen, isotopes from Chesapeake Bay, Sargasso Sea, Caribbean Sea, results from caves in South Africa, the Swiss Alps, Sea Surface reconstructions from Norway, the northern Pacific and the South Atlantic and other proxies too. Temperatures were higher 1000 years ago, and cooler 300 years ago. We started warming long before cars and powerstations were invented. There’s little correlation with CO2 levels. Here’s what 120 proxies from the Northern Hemisphere tell us Ljungqvist et al combined 120 proxies of all different kinds and found this pattern for the last 12 centuries across the Northern Hemisphere. Then there’s Christiansen et al 2012 who followed 32 proxies from the Northern Hemisphere back to the year 0 AD. Here’s the Medieval Warm Period in China Here’s the Medieval Warm Period in Antarctica, and the Little Ice Age: Just in case you thought there wasn’t enough from the Southern Hemisphere. Rosenthal et al 2013 put out quite the zinger of a paper. They’ve reconstructed the temperature of the water flowing out of the Pacific to the Indian Ocean over the last 10,000 years and as deep as 900m. The Indonesian Throughflow is pretty significant in global ocean currents. Clearly that water was warmer 1000 years ago than it was circa 1970. It was even warmer again in the Holocene. 3000 hot and cold years in a South African cave South African Cave last 3000 years Source: Holmgren 2001. See also here and here in African reconstructions. The Southern Ocean 7000 year record also shows long term cooling as well as the Roman Warm Period. Then there’s 10,000 mostly hotter years in Greenland No paleoclimate discussion is complete without GISP: 6,000 Boreholes show it was global Just some of the places these boreholes have been dug. They stick a thermometer down a hole, and all over the world there is a pattern that repeats as temperature changes on the surface travel gradually down through the rocks. Sure, the resolution is bare bones. The data is “smoothed”. We can’t use boreholes to know if things were warmer than today and we can’t tell how long ago that big last surge in warmth was, but where boreholes come into their own is in showing us just how global that last big warm spell was. Below is the latest iteration of a graph that went through a savage evolution from 1997 – 2008. What stayed constant was that boreholes always showed a medieval warm period and a little ice age, that is, except for the time Huang et al “lost” nearly 20,000 years of data. In the graph above, if the assumption about the speed of heat flow is shifted to line up the coolest point with other proxies in 1680 and the warmest point to somewhere around 1000 – 1200 the amplitude would increase (see the jaw dropping 1997 original paper which claimed it was much warmer in medieval times). These papers are by no means the only important ones. There are so many others… So go tell the world — everywhere we look the world was hotter and colder in the last 1000 years, the last 10,000 years and the last billion. h/t George, David B, Original Steve, Peter Fitzroy.

More people have died from the COVID-19 vaccine than from all other vaccines over the last 20 years… COMBINED.  That’s right: the vaccine that is supposed to “protect” you from COVID is now responsible for killing more people than all the other vaccines put together.  Does that make you feel safe yet?  This isn’t our calculation.  This number has been confirmed by the CDC itself.  More details on this alarming new figure below:  ""There have been nearly as many deaths from complications following inoculation with the so-called Covid-19 “vaccines” as there have been for all previous vaccines total since Jan. 1, 2001.""https://t.co/gIrHPDMiwq — Proud Neanderthal.

We’ve also been told to trust the science and to trust the experts.  Well… now the scientific experts at the CDC are telling us the vaccine is deadlier than all the other vaccines!  WND has a breakdown of the CDC’s revealing statement on their website:  There have been nearly as many deaths from complications following inoculation with the so-called Covid-19 “vaccines” as there have been for all previous vaccines total since Jan. 1, 2001. In fact, the data are five days old so the gap, which was at four on May 3, has almost certainly been bridged. According to the CDC website: “Over 245 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from Dec. 14, 2020, through May 3, 2021. During this time, VAERS received 4,178 reports of death (0.0017%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. CDC and FDA physicians review each case report of death as soon as notified and CDC requests medical records to further assess reports.” The website went on to boldly proclaim that a “review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines.” This is important medical editorializing so as not to scare people. The CDC has a vested interest in getting as many people vaccinated as possible, so even when burying the important data about deaths at the bottom of a page intended to assuage concerns over these experimental drugs, they did so with every intention of making people take it.  Of course, the concern over the vaccine is nothing new.  Fox News’ Tucker Carlson has been raising legitimate questions.  However, after a segment last week questioning the vaccine, Carlson’s segment was BANNED from YouTube.  Fortunately, people have been ripping the segment and sharing it online.  Watch it below before Big Tech takes it down again:  On this occasion, full marks to Fox News, but it is obviously an exception.  Carlson makes the point that in 4 months of Covid ""vaccines"", the 3,000+ deaths is greater than with all other vaccines in the previous 15 years.

As they should.  But similar to the 2020 presidential election, rather than answering these questions with transparency and integrity, people are refusing to talk about the numbers.  Fortunately for us, the numbers speak for themselves.  Conservative commentator David J. Harris, Jr. had this to say:  On Wednesday night’s episode of Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” host Tucker Carlson asked a very important question: “How many Americans have died after taking the COVID vaccines? Not Americans who’ve been killed by the virus, that’s a huge number, but how many Americans have died after getting the vaccines designed to prevent the virus? Do you know the answer to that question? Do you know anything about the downside? We know a lot about the upside of the vaccine. We’ve been completely in favor of vulnerable people taking vaccines.” With our federal government teetering on the edge of going full authoritarian concerning getting the COVID vaccine, do you know all the risks involved? President Joe Biden was on television Tuesday talking about vaccines, about how he wants us all to get one. In fact, everyone with authority wants you to get the COVID vaccine and they are starting to apply enormous pressure for people like me who have been holding out to get the shot. The Biden administration has said that they won’t force COVID vaccine passports or anything like that but when he said that Dr. Fauci also indicated, or was it a dog whistle, to institutions and corporations that they would start using some form of a COVID vaccine passport to let you into the building or use their services. You may not be able to fly on an airplane or go to work or even educate your children if you don’t get the vaccine. Friends and family members may tell you that you’re not welcome at their homes or events if you have not yet been vaccinated. Okay, so a lot of you are contemplating on getting the vaccine because you don’t want to have to deal with the immense pressure being applied on you, but before you get that shot, do you know anything at all about the possible risks of getting the shot? You probably don’t know what I’m about to tell you, and you should know because it’s your life we’re talking about. People don’t normally associate vaccines with causing serious problems, even fatalities, because vaccines for the most part are not dangerous, at least according to the numbers. About 160 million Americans get the flu shot each year, as do I, proving that I am not an anti-vaxxer. I just have questions about the COVID vaccine that I can’t really find too many people to answer. Tucker said, “Every year, a relatively small number of people seem to die after getting those shots. To be precise, in 2019, that number was 203 people. The year before, it was 119. In 2017, a total of 85 people died from the flu shot.” Out of 160 million people who get the flu shot, those numbers of people who died, every one of them being tragic to their loved ones, aren’t significant enough for the rest of us to consider not getting the flu shot. Carlson wanted to know how many people have died from getting the COVID vaccine: “We checked today. Here’s the answer, which comes from the same set of government numbers that we just listed: Between late December of 2020, and last month, a total of 3,362 people apparently died after getting the COVID vaccines in the United States. Three thousand, three hundred and sixty-two — that’s an average of 30 people every day. So, what does that add up to? By the way, that reporting period ended on April 23. We don’t have numbers past that, we’re not quite up to date. But we can assume that another 360 people have died in the 12 days since. That is a total of 3,722 deaths. Almost four thousand people died after getting the COVID vaccines. The actual number is almost certainly much higher than that — perhaps vastly higher.” [emphasis added] 99.9% Fine Silver MAGA Collector Coins! How come no one is talking about that? Do doctors and other medical personnel now instinctively know that you’re not supposed to talk about anything that violates the Woke Supremacy’s stance on COVID?

,"COVID-19 vaccination causes a more predictable immune response than infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine gives most people a high level of protection against COVID-19 and can provide added protection for people who already had COVID-19. One study showed that, for people who already had COVID-19, those who do not get vaccinated after their recovery are more than 2 times as likely to get COVID-19 again than those who get fully vaccinated after their recovery.  All COVID-19 vaccines currently available in the United States are effective at preventing COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can offer some protection from future illness, sometimes called “natural immunity,” but the level of protection people get from having COVID-19 may vary depending on how mild or severe their illness was, the time since their infection, and their age.  Getting a COVID-19 vaccination is also a safer way to build protection than getting sick with COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you by creating an antibody response without you having to experience sickness. Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can cause severe illness or death, and we can’t reliably predict who will have mild or severe illness. If you get sick, you can spread COVID-19 to others. You can also continue to have long-term health issues after COVID-19 infection.

,"Correction Appended  About two weeks ago, a security team spotted scorch marks on a basement doorway below 4 World Trade Center, on the east side of the ruined complex, according to officials.  Even in a place of mass devastation and death, those scorch marks got fast attention. They had not been noticed by a patrol team a few hours earlier, and behind the damaged -- but intact -- door were nearly a thousand tons of gold and silver. To security officials, it looked as if someone had tried to break in.  Within hours, a video surveillance system was installed to keep at least an electronic eye on the precious metals until their custodian, the Bank of Nova Scotia, had a chance to remove them. That work began this week.  A team of 30 firefighters and police officers are helping to move the metals, a task that can be measured practically down to the flake but that has been rounded off at 379,036 ounces of gold and 29,942,619 ounces of silver.  As layers of debris are peeled away, recovery workers are opening gangways to intact portions of a 16-acre basement that was largely unseen but was a place of spectacular scope in its own right. Just the basement area of the World Trade Center enclosed twice as much space as the entire Empire State Building.  Nearly a quarter of a mile below the spectacular vistas from the towers was their upside-down attic dropping 70 feet below the ground, a strange world with enough room for fortunes in gold and silver, for Godiva chocolates, assault weapons, old furniture, bricks of cocaine, phony taxicabs and Central Intelligence Agency files. With so many people still lost, the owners of this stuff have maintained a discreet silence during the recovery operations. But that doesn't mean they're not interested.  Beneath the Customs House -- 6 World Trade Center -- was an armada of government vehicles, including dozens owned by the Secret Service, in a fenced-off area. Within that area was a garage where a single armored limousine was parked under the tightest security.  The limousine was so long that it needed straight-line access to the street, because it could not clear tight corners in the basement.  That car had been used to carry heads of state visiting the city, said Tony Ball, a spokesman for the Secret Service. (The president's limousines are stored in Washington and flown everywhere he visits.)  In the 1993 trade center bombing, an armored Secret Service limousine was parked about 100 feet from a truck bomb. Although the bomb crashed through five stories of concrete and the concussion destroyed cars all over that floor, the Secret Service limousine ''did not even have a broken windshield,'' according to a government official on the scene that day. The condition of the limousine after September's attack was not known yesterday. ''We haven't gotten anything back yet,'' Mr. Ball said.  Asked about reports that his agency also kept what looked like ordinary taxis and telephone company trucks in the basement, Mr. Ball laughed. ''What I would say is that it is not unusual for law enforcement agencies to have these kinds of things,'' he said.  Besides the Secret Service, the building named for the United States Customs Service also housed an office of the C.I.A.  That building is now partly collapsed, with a rubble pit 30 feet deep. Somewhere in there are drugs, weapons and contraband seized by the Customs Service at the region's airports. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms also lost two evidence vaults, according to a spokesman for that agency, Joseph Green. They have not yet been recovered.  ''There could be several hundred weapons -- somewhere between 200 and 400, ranging from small-caliber semiautomatic pistols to assault rifles,'' Mr. Green said, adding that a few of the guns had been found. Agents plan to be on the scene when the remains of the building are demolished sometime in the next two weeks, he said.  ''After that, we'll be working at the landfill to search for any important items that are still missing.''  For people who have seen the surface destruction, either in pictures or in person, it may be hard to imagine that anything is intact below ground. But engineers and recovery officials say that large parts of the underground perimeter are undamaged, even though the buildings above them are partly collapsed.  One area is below 4 World Trade Center, where more than two decades ago, Swiss Bank built a huge vault and storage area. The vault was reached from the Swiss Bank offices by a private elevator.  To reach the vaults, armored trucks would drive through what had once been the tunnels for the Hudson and Manhattan railroad, the predecessor of the PATH system. These tunnels had run as far east as Church Street, but were not needed when the trade center was built and the PATH terminal was set closer to the river.  The western stubs of the original tunnels, ringed with cast iron, were converted into roadways. These roads ran directly to a roll-down door in front of the Swiss Bank vault area. Inside was a loading dock.  By the time of the 1993 bombing, Swiss Bank no longer was using the vault, and shortly afterward, the bank relocated its remaining operations.  The next tenant of the vault space was the Bank of Nova Scotia, which estimated the value of the metals at $200 million.  ''We are in the process of relocating the contents of our vault at World Trade Center building No. 4 to another secure location, because authorities need to demolish the building,'' Pam Agnew, a spokeswoman for the bank, said yesterday by phone from Toronto.  Some of the metal is owned by the bank, and some by its customers, she said. She declined to say where the metals were being taken.  ''The contents remain safe and intact,'' Ms. Agnew said. ''The contents are fully insured. We're working very closely with local authorities to ensure a safe and secure relocation effort.  ''The removal of the contents was not a priority for us because we've always known it was safe and secure,'' Ms. Agnew said.  Asked about what appeared to be an attempted break-in two weeks ago, Ms. Agnew said that she was unaware of it. Later, she called to reiterate that the metals were safe: ''It would be factually incorrect to say there had been any attempt to steal the contents of our vault.''  However, a government official involved in the recovery efforts said that there had clearly been an attempt within the last two weeks to enter the vault area. ''It looked like they used a blowtorch, a crowbar,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition that neither his name nor his position be identified. ''The Port Authority police began periodic patrols, and then a closed-circuit television system was put in.''  The bank also engaged Kroll Inc., a security business based in New York, to supervise the relocation of the gold and silver, a process that began this week, The Daily News reported yesterday.  Michael Cherkasky, the president of Kroll, declined to comment on his company's involvement.  Anyone trying to make off with the gold would not be able to run very fast: each ingot weighs 70 pounds.

,"Biden urges Covid booster to counter waning vaccine efficacy A pharmacist prepares a dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine at a clinic in New Orleans, Louisiana in August 2021  US President Joe Biden said Wednesday he will make Covid-19 booster shots available to all American adults beginning next month, as his administration warned that vaccines are showing a declining effectiveness against infection.  The move comes as scientists and health experts grapple with how to beat back the surging Delta variant of the coronavirus, and follows extensive debate over whether a third injection of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines would be appropriate.  Stressing this was ""no time to let our guard down,"" Biden urged every American 18 and older to get a booster eight months after becoming fully vaccinated.  ""This will boost your immune response, it will increase your protection from Covid-19, and it's the best way to protect ourselves from new variants that could arise,"" Biden said in an address from the White House.  ""It will make you safer, and for longer -- and it will help us end the pandemic faster.""  According to the plan, which is still pending a final evaluation by the Food and Drug Administration, the boosters would become available beginning the week of September 20.  Biden also unveiled a new facet in the push to increase vaccination rates: mandating nursing homes to require all workers be fully vaccinated as a condition for receiving federal funding for social safety net programs like Medicare.  The president highlighted how vaccination rates of the nation's 1.3 million nursing home workers ""significantly trail"" the rest of the country.  Earlier in the day the nation's top health authorities described how ""waning immunity"" after receiving vaccinations and the strength of the widespread Delta variant were necessitating a booster for most Americans.  ""We are concerned that this pattern of decline we are seeing will continue in the months ahead, which could lead to reduced protection against severe disease, hospitalization and death,"" US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said in a video press conference.  Story continues  Murthy and other members of the White House Covid-19 response team said that while vaccines remain remarkably effective, the best way to shore up protection is through a booster.  They said they also anticipate booster shots will be needed eventually for people who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which rolled out in March.  - Waning immunity -  More than 620,000 people have died in the United States from Covid-19, with case numbers increasing sharply in recent months due to the spread of the Delta variant.  Just over 50 percent of Americans are fully vaccinated, as the country's mass immunization program faces resistance in politically conservative regions in the South and Midwest and among some racial minorities.  Anthony Fauci, the country's leading infectious disease expert, pointed to studies showing significant drops in vaccine protection over time.  For instance, figures released by the Mayo Clinic showed that the effectiveness against the Delta variant slid from 76 to 42 percent with Pfizer's vaccine, and from 86 to 76 percent with Moderna's.  But a booster dose would increase the antibody levels in Covid vaccines tenfold, according to Fauci.  ""Higher levels of antibodies are associated with higher levels of vaccine efficacy,"" he told reporters.  Biden also addressed the concerns recently expressed by foreign leaders that a massive booster effort for Americans would come at the expense of billions of people worldwide who have yet to receive any coronavirus vaccine.  ""I disagree,"" the president said. ""We can take care of America and help the world at the same time.""

9ae080ef,"PM to set out his vision for a “truly twenty-first century” prison system, while calling for prison reform to be one of the “great progressive causes” of British politics Six new ‘reform prisons’ to be created this year, with full autonomy over how they operate and spend their budget Prison education system will also be completely transformed with full control being given to ‘reform prison’ governors, while protecting the £130m per year budget The Prime Minister is expected to slam the ‘scandalous failure’ of the prisons sector later today as he outlines his vision for a modern, more effective, truly twenty-first century prison system. Giving the first speech purely focused on prisons by a British PM in more than 2 decades, he will outline plans to give prison governors complete control over the way they run their prisons, which will empower staff, drive up standards and cut reoffending. He will promise 6 of these new ‘reform prisons’ by the end of the year and through a new Prisons Bill in the next session, has vowed to unleash these principles across the prisons system. The Prime Minister is expected to say: It can be easy for us all – when prisons are closed off by high walls and barbed wire – to adopt an “out of sight, out of mind” attitude. I want this government to be different. When I say we will tackle our deepest social problems and extend life chances, I want there to be no no-go areas. And that includes the 121 prisons in our country, where our social problems are most acute and people’s life chances are most absent. So I want to explain why I believe prison reform should be a great progressive cause in British politics and to set out my vision for a modern, more effective, truly twenty-first century prison system. My starting point is this: we need prisons. Some people – including, of course, rapists, murderers, child abusers, gang leaders – belong in them. For me, punishment – that deprivation of liberty – is not a dirty word. I never want us to forget that it is the victims of crime who should always be our principal priority. And I am not unrealistic or starry-eyed about what prisons can achieve. Not everyone shows remorse and not everyone seeks redemption. But I also strongly believe that we must offer chances to change; that for those trying hard to turn themselves around, we should offer hope; that in a compassionate country, we should help those who’ve made mistakes to find their way back onto the right path. In short: we need a prison system that doesn’t see prisoners as simply liabilities to be managed, but instead as potential assets to be harnessed. But the failure of our system today is scandalous. 46% of all prisoners will re-offend within a year of release. 60% of short-sentenced prisoners will reoffend within the same period. And current levels of prison violence, drug-taking and self-harm should shame us all. In a typical week, there will be almost 600 incidents of self-harm; at least one suicide; and 350 assaults, including 90 on staff. This failure really matters. It matters to the public purse: this cycle of reoffending costs up to £13 billion a year. It matters to you: because in the end, who are the victims of this re-offending? It’s the mother who gets burgled or the young boy who gets mugged. It matters to the prison staff – some of the most deeply committed public servants in our country – who have to work in dangerous and intimidating conditions. And yes, it matters to the prisoners themselves, who mustn’t feel like society has totally given up on them. I’m clear: we need wholesale reform. And I am convinced that with the right agenda, we can be world leaders in change just like we have been in welfare, just like in education we can demonstrate that with the right reforms, we can make a lasting difference to people in our society. The PM will also announce a drive to make our prisons more transparent in terms of how they operate, by developing proper data and meaningful metrics so we can easily compare prison performance. This could include measuring individual institutions’ reoffending levels, employment outcomes after release, place of residence following release and progress made on basic literacy and key skills. Alongside this, the PM will also confirm that the government will soon be publishing Dame Sally Coates’ review of prison education, where she will recommend the end to regional contracts and instead advises giving much greater control of education to prison governors. The recommendation, which has been accepted in full by the government, will be backed further by the government promising to protect prison education budgets in cash terms, with £130 million per year. And David Laws has agreed to chair a new social enterprise and work with Dame Sally Coates and organisations such as Teach First to develop a new scheme that will recruit high quality graduates who will transform prisons into places of rehabilitation and learning. David Laws said: I am a firm believer in the power of education and have seen first-hand the difference great teachers can make. I look forward to working with Dame Sally Coates to establish a graduate scheme that will help to support our vision of placing high quality education at the heart of the prison regime. Brett Wigdortz OBE, Founder & CEO of Teach First said: Over the last 13 years Teach First has, with our school and university partners, developed expertise in attracting and mobilising talented leaders to support and inspire the least advantaged in society. Like so many, we know that too often there is a link between low achievement at school and the prison population. I am therefore delighted to be able to share our knowledge of attracting talented individuals to key professions that transform the lives of those facing the greatest barriers.

,"For the past seven months, misinformation and false claims of fraud in Fulton County have dominated certain corners of the Internet and the Republican Party, with many refusing to accept results that showed three separate times that Donald Trump lost Georgia.  Georgia's most populous county is home to the heavily Democratic city of Atlanta — and a history of problems and shortcomings with election administration.  But ever since November's presidential race saw President Joe Biden flip Georgia by about 12,000 votes, some pro-Trump media outlets and politicians have zeroed in on Fulton in search of a smoking gun that would prove massive fraud cost the former president a victory. Those calls have come even after a full hand count risk-limiting audit (RLA) confirmed Biden's victory and a Trump campaign-ordered recount validated victory once more.  In recent weeks: A Newsmax personality launched a weekend of fantastical speculation about an alarm at a building that included Fulton's ballot warehouse; a Constitution Party officer who's espoused fringe views about 9/11, presidential assassinations and elections for years has advanced a lawsuit seeking to find ""counterfeit absentee ballots;"" and prominent lawmakers have suggested that evidence would emerge that could result in decertification of the election — all as election workers continue to face death threats for doing their jobs.  Ahead of a hearing on the lawsuit seeking to inspect images of Fulton's absentee ballots for fraud, a pair of pro-Trump media outlets have pushed false and misleading stories about the county's absentee drop box documentation and risk-limiting audit forms, implying or outright stating — but without real evidence — that the already-certified election should be overturned.    Fulton County drop box forms  One claim is that Fulton County is missing hundreds of transfer records for thousands of absentee ballots deposited in 38 drop boxes ahead of November's election, with an implication that the missing paperwork could or should invalidate more ballots than the margin of Biden's victory.  Earlier this week, a pro-Trump media outlet that has amplified calls for a so-called ""forensic audit"" of the election kicked off a firestorm of criticism, asserting the county was missing 385 absentee ballot transfer forms used to document how many ballots were retrieved from drop boxes daily and suggesting the provenance of nearly 19,000 ballots were questionable.  This comes from an ongoing open records request that the Georgia Star News made to Fulton for all transfer forms from the Nov. 3 election. The media outlet only received a portion of Fulton's forms.  According to Georgia Star News, an elections worker emailed the outlet stating that ""a few forms are missing"" and that ""some procedural paperwork may have been misplaced"" and the county disputed that 19,000 ballots were unaccounted for.  Then, the story published and rocketed across the pro-Trump mediasphere, prompting Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (who faces his own pro-Trump primary challenge from election denier Rep. Jody Hice) to announce an investigation in the county's actions and further fanning the flames.  But after GPB News asked the county Monday about the forms not included in the Georgia Star's records request, elections staff located all but eight of the more than 1,500 forms, sent them to state investigators and provided them to GPB News on a flash drive.  According to an analysis of the scanned transfer forms and a spreadsheet from Fulton elections, nearly 79,000 ballots were deposited in the county's 38 drop boxes — or more than half of mail-in ballots cast in the election.  Jessica Corbitt, a Fulton spokeswoman, said that the county followed proper procedures in collecting the drop box ballots and the county was continuing to research the few remaining. Fulton elections director Rick Barron said in an elections board meeting Thursday that staff spent more than 200 hours this week locating the forms, to counter the claims of ""missing"" forms.  Absentee drop boxes were authorized by an emergency State Election Board rule last year, which included the requirement of 24/7 video surveillance of the boxes as well as the transfer forms filled out by a two-person collection team. While the forms are required by rule, they are not part of the verification process to determine if an absentee ballot is legally cast and counted.  Some of the transfer forms show ballots returned without envelopes, making them ineligible to be counted. Others were from different counties or even different states — also not counted.  If Fulton County is unable to find the handful of transfer forms, they could be sent to the State Election Board for investigation, just as in Coffee, Grady and Taylor counties — and the forms have no effect on the authenticity of ballots or count of the election. Every ballot that is returned is tied to a voter, matched with an application for a ballot, and authenticated by poll workers before counting.  GPB News has obtained records for all 123 counties that used drop boxes, countering claims among some pro-Trump media outlets that there are more than 300,000 ballots' worth of forms ""missing"" statewide.  Grady County's registrar sent an email to the state saying there are no forms because ""I am the only one in my office, and I was the only one who emptied the drop box every day."" Taylor County's registrar said she did not keep track and asked ""How am I going to be able to do these forms?""  Those investigations are ongoing.  Fulton County risk-limiting audit  Thursday morning, a report by Just The News used selectively edited notes from a state-appointed monitor and a misunderstanding of elections and the risk-limiting audit process to claim that ballots ""may be missing.""  The article notes that in the tally sheet documents uploaded on the state's website, Fulton has several data entry errors — appearing to duplicate batches, missing some batch numbers and failing to check boxes about unsealing the container before counting.  But there are more human explanations to the paperwork — as well as a reminder that the results of that audit were not certified and did not affect the initial or final counts of the election.  After the first results of the election, Georgia's 159 counties conducted a full hand-count risk-limiting audit: a post-election audit that is designed to determine if the correct winner won, not verify the precise margin. Typically, an RLA would use a smaller, statistically significant random sampling of ballots that are hand counted and compared to the results. But because the margin in the presidential contest was narrow and attention was so high, the state ordered all the ballots to be hand counted.  During the RLA process, some counties discovered ballots that were not included in the original tally, but the results of the RLA did not change the results of the election. Any mistakes were incorporated into a machine recount requested by the Trump campaign after the RLA.  As for the missing batch numbers and duplicate batches, Georgia's RLA used a software called Arlo from a company called VotingWorks, who helped the state conduct the audit. Once the audit teams counted their batches and filled out the tally sheets, the batches were entered into the system. Fulton officials said it was not easy to see previous batches entered to ensure there was not duplication.  There are 1,927 tally sheets on the Fulton documents section of the state's RLA results, and 1,916 rows of batches on the state's Excel spreadsheet. Additionally, Fulton's election results saw Joe Biden get 381,144 votes and Donald Trump get 137,240 votes. The RLA tallies show 381,179 votes for Biden and 137,620 votes for Trump, confirming Biden won and coming within 0.1% of the ballots cast the first time.  As for the notes from Seven Hills Strategies that suggest fraudulent activity, according to copies of the reports obtained by GPB News, the monitor found plenty of parts of the process that need improvement, but no evidence of fraud.  It is also important to remember the context for these claims as well as the messengers: All of this comes days before a hearing to potentially dismiss a case seeking to inspect higher resolution scans of Fulton's absentee ballots that many in the pro-Trump sphere are heralding as the doorway to somehow ""forensically audit"" Georgia's votes — a fantasy that is undermining trust in the Republican-picked and Republican-controlled election system ahead of a contentious 2022 statewide election.",Fact Check: Fulton County Is Not Missing Ballots Or Hundreds Of Drop Box Custody Forms,true,138675248850509860949526610093702868912
,"Washington (AFP) –  Advertising Read more  Despite a century of medical advances, more Americans have now died from Covid-19 than the number who succumbed to the 1918 flu pandemic, according to new data.  The latest grim milestone comes as the country is experiencing a fourth-wave driven by the highly contagious Delta variant, with low vaccination uptake in many regions the main cause of death.  Johns Hopkins University tracker showed 675,722 US coronavirus deaths as of Friday, which surpasses the 675,000 US deaths during the influenza outbreak that began in the last year of World War I.  All told, some 50 million died worldwide in the flu pandemic -- sometimes inaccurately referred to as the ""Spanish flu"" -- making it the deadliest event in human history, according to epidemiologists.  That far exceeds global Covid deaths so far -- around 4.7 million.  But the United States has borne a disproportionate 14 percent of those fatalities, despite making up only five percent of the world's population.  The American population in 1918 was less than a third of what it is now, meaning the flu deaths would be equivalent to some 2.2 million in today's terms.  Unlike today's influenzas, which impact children and the elderly the most, the 1918 flu caused unusually high mortality among young adults.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with no vaccines and no antibiotics for secondary bacterial complications, control efforts were limited in the 1918-19 to non-pharmaceutical measures.  These included ""isolation, quarantine, good personal hygiene, use of disinfectants, and limitations of public gatherings,"" it said.  Many of the same measures, including face masks, were recommended when the Covid pandemic began.  Now, however, there are also multiple safe and highly effective vaccines that were developed and tested in record-time -- but 24 percent of US adults, or almost 60 million, haven't yet gotten their first dose.  Uptake has been hit by a polarized political climate and what experts call an epistemological crisis, with misinformation supercharging vaccine hesitancy to historically new heights.  Beyond vaccines, effective treatments have been developed such as monoclonal antibodies, corticosteroids to dial down hyperactive immune responses in patients with severe Covid, and advanced ventilators.

The criteria for diagnosis -- through clinical means or a lab test -- has varied from country-to-country.

,"WSTA scores historic win as Government announce scrapping of arduous and unnecessary wine paperwork  The Wine and Spirit Trade Association has won a significant post-Brexit victory, for its members and consumers, after government has agreed to scrap wine-specific paperwork on imports from across the globe.  Following the referendum, the WSTA started a campaign calling for Government to do away with the time consuming and costly VI-1 forms on imported wine.  The historic removal of this unnecessary red tape will mean the UK’s 33 million wine consumers will be able to continue to enjoy the vast range of imported wines without additional costs.  After leaving the EU the WSTA warned that the introduction of the new forms and laboratory test demands would have brought wine imports from the EU to a standstill and cost the industry approximately £70 million. Today’s decision to scrap all wine import certificates, not just those for EU wine, will see even greater savings – approximately £100m.  Defra’s announcement that wine-specific VI-1 forms will now not be required for imports from the EU and beyond, is a huge boost for producers, importers and consumers – 99% of wine consumed in the UK is imported, with 55% of that coming from the EU.  The UK wine industry contributes around £11 billion every year in economic activity and employs 130,000 people across the supply chain. The scrapping of these non-tariff barriers, championed by the WSTA will prevent the price of a bottle of wine increasing by around 13p.  If the plans to introduce VI-1s to wine coming in from the EU had come into play, imports would have required laboratory analysis – a process the WSTA estimates would have cost about £330 per shipment and may well have put off smaller producers from sending their wines to the UK reducing consumer choice.  Miles Beale, Chief Executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, said:  “This is a truly historic moment for the UK’s world-leading wine trade. We have spent more than two years campaigning relentlessly to avoid the introduction of new import certificates for EU wine imports on the one hand and scrapping the unnecessary and costly VI-1 wine paperwork for on-EU wine imports on the other. The first would have cost the UK wine industry some £70m [annually], reduced consumer choice and bumped up prices. The second will increase those savings to over £100 million. It’s a truly fantastic outcome.  “It is heartening to know that Government trust the WSTA’s advice and are listening to the concerns of business, particularly SMEs. This is a major win for wine lovers and the UK wine industry. I am sure corks will be popping across the globe in celebration of this most welcome news.”  James Miles, Chairman and Managing Director (Co-Founder) at Liv-ex Ltd said:  “I cannot overstate how important today’s announcement is to the UK wine industry. The WSTA and its members have been campaigning hard to stop UK officials from imposing unnecessary import regulations on the wine trade.  “Government has shown it is in tune with business by taking this once in a lifetime opportunity. By removing these unnecessary and costly non-tariff barriers to trade it has re-set our trading arrangements with the rest of the world in a way that that will enhance the UK’s leading position in the global wine trade.”",WSTA scores historic win as Government announce scrapping of arduous and unnecessary wine paperwork,true,269437094777859855526235773701930631244
,"A promising Australian candidate for a coronavirus vaccine has been abandoned after trial participants returned false HIV positive results. Australia had previously agreed to buy 51 million doses of the vaccine being developed by Australian firm CSL and the University of Queensland (UQ). The government said orders of other vaccines would now fill the shortfall. CSL and UQ stressed that the positive results were false - meaning trial participants' health was not at risk. The Australian government said it had now entered an agreement for the Novavax vaccine, and upped its existing order of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. The UK was the first to begin rolling out a vaccine from Pfizer this week.What happened with the UQ/CSL vaccine? The vaccine had been in stage one of trials, and proving to be effective in making antibodies. But it also generated HIV antibodies in some recipients - which meant it showed false positives for HIV. Further testing proved the HIV wasn't there. CSL and UQ said fixing the flaw would take about a year, prompting a decision to abandon the trial. ""It was likely to work. But we knew that we didn't want to have any issues with confidence, and this false-positive test may have caused some confusion and lack of confidence,"" said Brendan Murphy, secretary of Australia's Department of Health.Vaccine co-lead Paul Young described the decision as ""devastating"" after 11 months of ""living and breathing this project"". ""While this is a tough decision to take, the urgent need for a vaccine has to be everyone's priority,"" he said. Other medical experts have also praised the ""realistic"" decision to abandon the UQ vaccine, saying it reflects the reality of vaccine development. ""In general, about 90% of vaccines never make it to market. As a global community, we have been spoilt with the unprecedented swiftness and success with which the development of Covid-19 vaccines have taken place,"" said infectious diseases expert Sanjaya Senanayake from the Australian National University. What does it mean for Australia? Australia has all but eliminated community transmission of the virus, after getting on top of outbreaks in recent months. Prof Murphy said the nation was in a ""wonderful position"" at present, but there would be ""full population coverage"" from two vaccines in 2021. ""We don't need emergency approval - we're in a good position because we've controlled the virus,"" he said on Friday. ""So I'm very confident about the successful vaccination strategy that we'll be facing next year."" The government said it had prepared for this sort of situation and as such had ""spread the risk"" with multiple deals for vaccines. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said focusing Australia's manufacturing efforts on the other vaccines would mean ""we are more likely to have the entire population vaccinated earlier rather than later"". The Oxford vaccine has been found to be ""safe and effective"", according to researchers, but is awaiting approval from regulators around the world. Early 2021 is still listed as when the first vaccines - most likely from Oxford/AstraZeneca - are scheduled to be given to Australians. Australia has a population of 25 million people. It recorded just one case of local transmission in the past week. The nation has reported 908 deaths and 28,000 cases so far during the pandemic - far fewer than many nations. It has been praised for responding quickly to the pandemic with border shutdowns, lockdown measures and aggressive contract-tracing efforts. Some failures, however, have been blamed for deaths.

,"“The greenhouse effect is here.”  – Jim Hansen, 23rd June 1988, Senate Testimony  The first transient climate projections using GCMs are 30 years old this year, and they have stood up remarkably well.  We’ve looked at the skill in the Hansen et al (1988) (pdf) simulations before (back in 2008), and we said at the time that the simulations were skillful and that differences from observations would be clearer with a decade or two’s more data. Well, another decade has passed!        How should we go about assessing past projections? There have been updates to historical data (what we think really happened to concentrations, emissions etc.), none of the future scenarios (A, B, and C) were (of course) an exact match to what happened, and we now understand (and simulate) more of the complex drivers of change which were not included originally.  The easiest assessment is the crudest. What were the temperature trends predicted and what were the trends observed? The simulations were run in 1984 or so, and that seems a reasonable beginning date for a trend calculation through to the last full year available, 2017. The modeled changes were as follows:  Scenario A: 0.33±0.03ºC/decade (95% CI)  Scenario B: 0.28±0.03ºC/decade (95% CI)  Scenario C: 0.16±0.03ºC/decade (95% CI)  The observed changes 1984-2017 are 0.19±0.03ºC/decade (GISTEMP), or 0.21±0.03ºC/decade (Cowtan and Way), lying between Scenario B and C, and notably smaller than Scenario A. Compared to 10 years ago, the uncertainties on the trends have halved, and so the different scenarios are more clearly distinguished. By this measure it is clear that the scenarios bracketed the reality (as they were designed to), but did not match it exactly. Can we say more by looking at the details of what was in the scenarios more specifically? Yes, we can.  This is what the inputs into the climate model were (CO 2 , N 2 O, CH 4 and CFC amounts) compared to observations (through to 2014):  Estimates of CO 2 growth in Scenarios A and B were quite good, but estimates of N 2 O and CH 4 overshot what happened (estimates of global CH 4 have been revised down since the 1980s). CFCs were similarly overestimated (except in scenario C which was surprisingly prescient!). Note that when scenarios were designed and started (in 1983), the Montreal Protocol had yet to be signed, and so anticipated growth in CFCs in Scenarios A and B was pessimistic. The additional CFC changes in Scenario A compared to Scenario B were intended to produce a maximum estimate of what other forcings (ozone pollution, other CFCs etc.) might have done.  But the model sees the net effect of all the trace gases (and whatever other effects are included, which in this case is mainly volcanoes). So what was the net forcing since 1984 in each scenario?  There are multiple ways of defining the forcings, and the exact value in any specific model is a function of the radiative transfer code and background climatology. Additionally, knowing exactly what the forcings in the real world have been is hard to do precisely. Nonetheless, these subtleties are small compared to the signal, and it’s clear that the forcings in Scenario A and B will have overshot the real world.        If we compare the H88 forcings since 1984 to an estimate of the total anthropogenic forcings calculated for the CMIP5 experiments (1984 through to 2012), the main conclusion is very clear – forcing in scenario A is almost a factor of two larger (and growing) than our best estimate of what happened, and scenario B overshoots by about 20-30%. By contrast, scenario C undershoots by about 40% (which gets worse over time). The slight differences because of the forcing definition, whether you take forcing efficacy into account and independent estimates of the effects of aerosols etc. are small effects. We can also ignore the natural forcings here (mostly volcanic), which is also a small effect over the longer term (Scenarios B and C had an “El Chichon”-like volcano go off in 1995).  The amount that scenario B overshoots the CMIP5 forcing is almost equal to the over-estimate of the CFC trends. Without that, it would have been spot on (the over-estimates of CH 4 and N 2 O are balanced by missing anthropogenic forcings).  The model predictions were skillful  Predictive skill is defined as the whether the model projection is better than you would have got assuming some reasonable null hypothesis. With respect to these projections, this was looked at by Hargreaves (2010) and can be updated here. The appropriate null hypothesis (which at the time would have been the most skillful over the historical record) would be a prediction of persistence of the 20 year mean, ie. the 1964-1983 mean anomaly. Whether you look at the trends or annual mean data, this gives positive skill for all the model projections regardless of the observational dataset used. i.e. all scenarios gave better predictions than a forecast based on persistence.        What do these projections tell us about the real world?  Can we make an estimate of what the model would have done with the correct forcing? Yes. The trends don’t completely scale with the forcing but a reduction of 20-30% in the trends of Scenario B to match the estimated forcings from the real world would give a trend of 0.20-0.22ºC/decade – remarkably close to the observations. One might even ask how would the sensitivity of the model need to be changed to get the observed trend? The equilibrium climate sensitivity of the Hansen model was 4.2ºC for doubled CO 2 , and so you could infer that a model with a sensitivity of say, 3.6ºC, would likely have had a better match (assuming that the transient climate response scales with the equilibrium value which isn’t quite valid).  Hansen was correct to claim that greenhouse warming had been detected  In June 1988, at the Senate hearing linked above, Hansen stated clearly that he was 99% sure that we were already seeing the effects of anthropogenic global warming. This is a statement about the detection of climate change – had the predicted effect ‘come out of the noise’ of internal variability and other factors? And with what confidence?  In retrospect, we can examine this issue more carefully. By estimating the response we would see in the global means from just natural forcings, and including a measure of internal variability, we should be able to see when the global warming signal emerged.        The shading in the figure (showing results from the CMIP5 GISS ModelE2), is a 95% confidence interval around the “all natural forcings” simulations. From this it’s easy to see that temperatures in 1988 (and indeed, since about 1978) fall easily outside the uncertainty bands. 99% confidence is associated with data more than ~2.6 standard deviations outside of the expected range, and even if you think that the internal variability is underestimated in this figure (double it to be conservative), the temperatures in any year past 1985 are more than 3 s.d. above the “natural” expectation. That is surely enough clarity to retrospectively support Hansen’s claim.  At the time however, the claim was more controversial; modeling was in it’s early stages, and estimates of internal variability and the relevant forcings were poorer, and so Hansen was going out on a little bit of a limb based on his understanding and insight into the problem. But he was right.  Misrepresentations and lies  Over the years, many people have misrepresented what was predicted and what could have been expected. Most (in)famously, Pat Michaels testified in Congress about climate changes and claimed that the predictions were wrong by 300% (!) – but his conclusion was drawn from a doctored graph (Cato Institute version) of the predictions where he erased the lower two scenarios:  Undoubtedly there will be claims this week that Scenario A was the most accurate projection of the forcings [Narrator: It was not]. Or they will show only the CO 2 projection (and ignore the other factors). Similarly, someone will claim that the projections have been “falsified” because the temperature trends in Scenario B are statistically distinguishable from those in the real world. But this sleight of hand is trying to conflate a very specific set of hypotheses (the forcings combined with the model used) which no-one expects (or expected) to perfectly match reality, with the much more robust and valid prediction that the trajectory of greenhouse gases would lead to substantive warming by now – as indeed it has.

4852bd38,"After Category 5 Cyclone Pam tore his country apart, prompting a humanitarian emergency, Vanuatu's President Baldwin Lonsdale pinned at least part of the blame for the islands' predicament on manmade global warming.  The storm, which struck with a ferocity the country had not experienced before in modern history, had sustained winds of 165 miles per hour, with gusts exceeding 200 miles per hour when it roared through the tiny country. It leveled homes and businesses, and stripped trees bare on the most populated island of Efate, including the capital of Port Vila. The death toll stood at 24 on Tuesday, but it is expected to rise as more information begins streaming in from outlying islands that have been cut off from the outside world.  “This is a very devastating cyclone … I term it a monster that has hit Vanuatu,” Lonsdale said at a U.N. disaster summit in Japan, according to The Guardian. “It is a setback for the government and for the people of Vanuatu. … All the development that has taken place has been wiped out.”  He said the cyclone seasons that the nation had experienced were the result of climate change. “We see the level of sea rise … the cyclone seasons, the warm, the rain, all this is affected,” he said.  So, is the president correct to link the devastating cyclone to global warming? Or is the tie so tenuous that it's almost nonexistent? The answer, as it often is in climate science, is far more nuanced than Vanuatu's president portrays it.  Scientists say unusually mild sea surface temperatures and added atmospheric water vapor helped the storm intensify before slamming into Vanuatu. At the same time, rising sea levels likely made the storm more damaging than it would have been just a few decades ago.  Here are the main factors to consider when analyzing the potential ties between Cyclone Pam and the warming climate.  Ocean temperatures are the main suspect  Scientists Mashable contacted said the storm intensified rapidly before hitting Vanuatu, aided by an area of unusually mild ocean waters and favorable atmospheric conditions. Ocean temperatures in the area where the cyclone intensified were up to 2 degrees Celsius above average for this time of year (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).  Some — but not all — of the sea surface temperature anomalies in the Southwest Pacific Ocean are likely related to global warming, according to Kevin Trenberth, a climate researcher with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, as well as other experts.  Global sea surface temperatures, showing an area of extremely warm water near Vanuatu and Australia. Image: NOAA/ESRL  According to Trenberth, about about 0.6 degrees Celsius, or 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit, of the ocean temperature anomalies ""can be blamed on human-induced global warming"" while the rest is ""natural"" and associated with an ongoing El Niño event in the tropical Pacific Ocean.  El Niño is a climate phenomenon that features warmer than average ocean temperatures in much of the tropical Pacific Ocean. It can alter worldwide weather patterns, including tropical cyclone seasons in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.  Whatever the cause, though, the warm ocean waters can supercharge storms like Cyclone Pam, as more evaporation takes place and moisture is added to the air.  ""The atmosphere all around there has some 10 to 20% more moisture in it than a comparable storm in the 1970s would have had. The high sea surface temperatures and the water vapor fueled the storm and undoubtedly increased its intensity and size,"" Trenberth said in an email conversation. ""The winds are stronger, the storm surge is greater on higher sea levels.""  El Niño ""has played a role here on top of global warming. But strong storms can certainly occur in that region anyway (but not this strong). The sea surface temperatures are over 86 degrees Fahrenheit for heaven's sake,"" he said.  An analysis of long-term trends in sea surface temperatures in the region where Cyclone Pam rapidly intensified into a Category 5 monster shows that there has been a warming trend since 1948, although there are considerable uncertainties in this data, says Michael Ventrice, an operational meteorologist at WSI Corporation in Massachusetts. He said it is not clear from the data whether the higher temperatures were a result of natural variations or human effects.  Sea surface temperature departures from average in the vicinity of Vanuatu and Australia as of March 16, 2015. Image: WeatherbellAnalytics  ""The bottom line point is that there has been a long-term warming trend observed in the location where Pam intensified,"" Ventrice said.  Madden and Julian...  Ventrice says Cyclone Pam ""thrived"" in an environment that was well-suited to explosive intensification. These environmental factors included the warm ocean waters that extended deep into the ocean, as well as a natural weather cycle known as the Madden Julian Oscillation, or MJO.  In certain instances, the MJO can encourage the air to rise, forming thunderstorms as well as tropical cyclones. Think of the MJO as a helping hand that likely aided the storm's rapid intensification.  ""The MJO acts to moisten the middle and upper-levels of the atmosphere and reduce vertical wind shear, both are which parameters that are musts for intensification,"" Ventrice said.  Few robust trends in tropical cyclones near Vanuatu  Climate research has shown that tropical cyclones in many ocean basins are becoming stronger and lasting longer than they used to. However, the Southwest Pacific, where Cyclone Pam occurred, is not one of these areas, possibly due to the relative paucity of data there.  Kerry Emanuel, a meteorologist at MIT who is a prominent researcher examining global warming-related trends in tropical storms and hurricanes, told Mashable that not much can be said about trends in the vicinity of Vanuatu.  ""Ironically, this is a part of the world where we do not observe any significant upward trends in tropical cyclone metrics, and few models predict upward trends there as a consequence of global warming,"" he said in an email.  In a post for the blog Realclimate on March 18, Emanuel wrote that there are signs that some parameters of severe tropical cyclones are changing, even in areas like the Southwest Pacific basin where data is relatively sparse.  ""While Pam and Haiyan, as well as other recent tropical cyclone disasters, cannot be uniquely pinned on global warming, they have no doubt been influenced by natural and anthropogenic climate change and they do remind us of our continuing vulnerability to such storms,"" Emanuel said.  Tom Knutson, a researcher with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, says that of the six ocean basins that give rise to tropical cyclones, the Southwest Pacific basin is an area that shows the least tendency for an increase in storm activity by the end of the century. In fact, there may be a decrease in cyclone frequency or intensity there, based on the most recent computer model simulations, Knutson says.  James Elsner, a professor at Florida State University who has been investigating how global warming may be altering the strongest storms on Earth, says he would be surprised if South Pacific storms were not growing stronger, like storms elsewhere. But the data is not yet there to prove it.  ""We have a pretty solid basis (physical & empirical) for our understanding that ocean heat makes the strongest tropical cyclones stronger,"" he said. ""Empirically it has been shown for the global as a whole and for the North Atlantic. But the signal is hard to see in noisy data, and especially where confounded by a trend toward fewer cyclones.""  Although global warming signals may not be present yet, multiple studies have shown that manmade global warming is likely to cause tropical cyclones (including hurricanes and typhoons) to be more intense, on average, than they are today, which means these storms will be more destructive. Manmade warming is also likely to lead to an uptick in the number of extremely intense tropical cyclones in some ocean basins during the next several decades, according to peer reviewed research.  Since sea-level rise is already making cyclones more destructive by giving them a higher launching pad for storm surge flooding, this means that future storms may be an order of magnitude more damaging than what we typically experience today.  As a small, low-lying island nation, Vanuatu is acutely aware of rising sea levels due to global warming. Along with other small island countries, some of which were affected by the same cyclone, Vanuatu has lobbied the U.N. in favor of steep greenhouse gas emissions cuts to reduce the severity of climate change, seeing it as a matter of its very survival as a nation.",Vanuatu's president makes a leap in tying Cyclone Pam to climate change,true,
34855333,"Ever since 2012, scientists have been debating a complex and frankly explosive idea about how a warming planet will alter our weather — one that, if it’s correct, would have profound implications across the Northern Hemisphere and especially in its middle latitudes, where hundreds of millions of people live. The idea is that climate change doesn’t merely increase the overall likelihood of heat waves, say, or the volume of rainfall — it also changes the flow of weather itself. By altering massive planet-scale air patterns like the jet stream (pictured above), which flows in waves from west to east in the Northern Hemisphere, a warming planet causes our weather to become more stuck in place. This means that a given weather pattern, whatever it may be, may persist for longer, thus driving extreme droughts, heat waves, downpours and more. This basic idea has sparked half a decade of criticism and debate, and at the cutting edge of research, scientists continue to grapple with it. And now, a new study once again reinforces one of its core aspects. ublishing in Nature Scientific Reports, Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University and a group of colleagues at research institutes in the United States, Germany and the Netherlands find that at least in the spring and summer, the large scale flow of the atmosphere is indeed changing in such a way as to cause weather to get stuck more often.  The study, its authors write, “adds to the weight of evidence for a human influence on the occurrence of devastating events such as the 2003 European heat wave, the 2010 Pakistan flood and Russian heat wave, the 2011 Texas heat wave and recent floods in Europe.” But what does it mean for global warming to alter the jet stream? The basic ideas at play here get complicated fast. The study itself, for instance, refers to “quasi-resonant amplification (QRA) of synoptic-scale waves” as the key mechanism for how researchers believe this is happening — terminology sure to impart terror in nonscientists worldwide.  On the other hand, some of this isn’t all that complicated. The Northern Hemisphere jet stream flows in a wavy pattern from west to east, driven by the rotation of the Earth and the difference in temperature between the equator and the North Pole. The flow is stronger when that temperature difference is large. But when the Arctic warms up faster than the equator does — which is part of the fundamental definition of global warming, and which is already happening — the jet stream’s flow can become weakened and elongated. That’s when you can get the resultant weather extremes. “It’s sort of like if you confine an electromagnetic wave to a coaxial cable, then you’re not losing energy, it’s being tightly contained in that cable and sent to your television,” said Mann. “These waves aren’t losing energy, so they grow and get larger and get stuck in place as well.” What the new study is saying is that in summer, in particular, this can occur. Moreover, it finds that a particular temperature pattern is linked to that behavior — and this temperature pattern, featuring an extra warm Arctic, is becoming more frequent over time, based on both observations and also a review of the outputs of high powered climate change models that the researchers conducted.  “We think that the signal has emerged from the noise over the last decade,” said Mann. One researcher who co-wrote an influential 2012 study suggesting that changes in the Arctic could be driving mid-latitude weather extremes, Stephen Vavrus of the University of Wisconsin, praised the new research in an emailed comment Monday. “This study goes beyond statistical correlations and explores a specific process that can plausibly explain how enhanced high-latitude warming trends may trigger remote weather impacts,” he said. But other scientific authors have expressed considerable skepticism of these kinds of ideas in the past. A recent study in Nature GeosciOne author of that study, John Fyfe of the Canadian Center for Climate Modeling and Analysis at Environment and Climate Change Canada, remarked of the Mann paper by email: “It is well established that there has been a human influence on the large-scale atmospheric circulation and temperature of the Northern Hemisphere. Mann et al. advance a theory that attempts to link those changes to changes in the spectrum of shorter-scale waves in the atmosphere, which are our weathermakers. I do not believe that this theory is fully developed or that the implications have been fully explored, but I do think that Mann et al.  study is a very good start.” The current study really only covers weather extremes in the spring and summer. For extremes occurring in winter, Mann said, we need to look to other mechanisms for odd atmospheric behavior. Nonetheless, the work represents yet another suggestion that a changing climate is leading to a changing pattern of atmospheric flow, with major implications for the weather felt by a massive swath of the global population. Mann, who testifies before Congress this week in a session that is expected to feature a rip-roaring debate about the severity of climate change, commented, “That’s going to be a fake debate. But this stuff is where the real debate is now.”ence, for instance, called into question whether the Arctic’s melting, and in particular its sea ice loss, has been causing winter cooling over Eurasia, another idea that has been swept up in the debate over the jet stream and weather extremes.",One of the most troubling ideas about climate change just found new evidence in its favor,true,

Thousands never get the support they need, and suicide is a leading cause of death in expectant and new mothers. After years of insufficient funding, NHS England has finally agreed to act, pledging £365million over the next five years. Officials today launch a £5million development fund for health boards to tackle the problem, which they hope will treat 30,000 new or expectant mothers a year. Experts have long warned that post-natal depression had gone ignored. Yet the cost of treating the problem is minimal, adding an estimated £83 to the £2,800 average cost of maternity care. Left untreated, however, the cost rises to an average of £10,000 per woman. Vicki Nash, of mental health charity Mind, welcomed the new funding, but added: ‘Too many simply don’t get the right support in these vital months. This can lead to catastrophic consequences. ‘It is vitally important now that NHS England and clinical commissioning groups take this opportunity to work together and ensure that this money gets to the frontline fast.’ Consultant psychiatrist Dr Alain Gregoire, chairman of the Maternal Mental Health Alliance, said: ‘In many parts of the country there are no services at all, not even someone who can give some advice.

The foundation, formed in honor of the president’s late son and former Delware Attorney General, focuses on childrens issues.  Advertisement  Golf partners were Ron Olivere and Steve Ricchett. Olivere is the father of Beau Biden’s widow Hallie.  Biden is a member of the club located near his home in the Greenville area.  Pool reporters shouted out questions to Biden about the refugee situation.  It was the president’s first golf outing since taking office in January. In the past, Biden was known as one of the better golfers on the Washington, D.C. political scene.  On Sunday, Joe and Jill Biden attended the confirmation of his grandson Hunter Biden II at St. Joseph on the Brandywine II and visited a residence in Greenville.  The Cape Gazette reported Saturday that the First Lady had been staying at the family’s second home near Rehoboth Beach after undergoing a medical procedure that went well. It did not appear that the president had traveled to Rehoboth.  Ocean City, MD business owners have been concerned about being able to tow banner advertisng due to possible flight bans over beach areas should the Bidens stay at the residence during the summer.  The Cape Gazette earlier reported that a landing pad is available for the president at a nearby state park’s parking lot.  Joe Biden has been criticized for frequent weekend trips from the White House to Delaware from some motorists who get caught up in the delays, those who believe he should not travel during the pandemic, or some who see such travel as too costly.  The sentiments surface on Facebook pages of news sites and also include supporters chiming in. Biden supporters point to the frequent trips of his predecessor Donald Trump to his golf resort on the Florida coast as well as golfing in Washington, D.C. area and at his New Jersey country club.  Perhaps out of concern about traffic tie-ups that have been featured in the News Journal, Biden departed to Washington, D.C. Sunday night, arriving at the White House at around 9:30 p.m. via Marine One. He departed the White House early Friday night, arriving at New Castle Airport, with a small motorcade taking him to his residence.  The Delaware route to and from his home was recently in the news when the Coast Guard asked for a security designation for the Christina River. A crossing over the river is on the motorcade route.  The visits do have a modest economic impact on Wilmington, thanks to a small press corps that travels with the president. The visits continue to raise the profile of Wilmington as reporters use the city as a backdrop.  Recently the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised that travel is a low-risk activity for vaccinated Americans.

0192a5cc,"The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown is an awful tragedy that continues to send shockwaves through the community of Ferguson, Missouri and across the nation. If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off. But, I wouldn’t have expected to be shot. The outrage in Ferguson is understandable—though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response. The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action. Glenn Reynolds, in Popular Mechanics, recognized the increasing militarization of the police five years ago. In 2009 he wrote: Soldiers and police are supposed to be different. … Police look inward. They’re supposed to protect their fellow citizens from criminals, and to maintain order with a minimum of force. It’s the difference between Audie Murphy and Andy Griffith. But nowadays, police are looking, and acting, more like soldiers than cops, with bad consequences. And those who suffer the consequences are usually innocent civilians. The Cato Institute’s Walter Olson observed this week how the rising militarization of law enforcement is currently playing out in Ferguson: Why armored vehicles in a Midwestern inner suburb? Why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors? Why are the authorities in Ferguson, Mo. so given to quasi-martial crowd control methods (such as bans on walking on the street) and, per the reporting of Riverfront Times, the firing of tear gas at people in their own yards? (“‘This my property!’ he shouted, prompting police to fire a tear gas canister directly at his face.”) Why would someone identifying himself as an 82nd Airborne Army veteran, observing the Ferguson police scene, comment that “We rolled lighter than that in an actual warzone”? Olson added, “the dominant visual aspect of the story, however, has been the sight of overpowering police forces confronting unarmed protesters who are seen waving signs or just their hands.” How did this happen? Most police officers are good cops and good people. It is an unquestionably difficult job, especially in the current circumstances. There is a systemic problem with today’s law enforcement. Not surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies—where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement. This is usually done in the name of fighting the war on drugs or terrorism. The Heritage Foundation’s Evan Bernick wrote in 2013 that, “the Department of Homeland Security has handed out anti-terrorism grants to cities and towns across the country, enabling them to buy armored vehicles, guns, armor, aircraft, and other equipment.” Bernick continued, “federal agencies of all stripes, as well as local police departments in towns with populations less than 14,000, come equipped with SWAT teams and heavy artillery.” Bernick noted the cartoonish imbalance between the equipment some police departments possess and the constituents they serve, “today, Bossier Parish, Louisiana, has a .50 caliber gun mounted on an armored vehicle. The Pentagon gives away millions of pieces of military equipment to police departments across the country—tanks included.” When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury—national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture—we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands. Given these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them. This is part of the anguish we are seeing in the tragic events outside of St. Louis, Missouri. It is what the citizens of Ferguson feel when there is an unfortunate and heartbreaking shooting like the incident with Michael Brown. Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth. The militarization of our law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm. It is one thing for federal officials to work in conjunction with local authorities to reduce or solve crime. It is quite another for them to subsidize it. Americans must never sacrifice their liberty for an illusive and dangerous, or false, security. This has been a cause I have championed for years, and one that is at a near-crisis point in our country. Let us continue to pray for Michael Brown’s family, the people of Ferguson, police, and citizens alike. Paul is the junior U.S. Senator for Kentucky.",Rand Paul: We Must Demilitarize the Police,true,
46479a5c,"A West Michigan woman says she raised more than $11,000 this past weekend to afford a heart transplant after Spectrum Health rejected her from its transplant list. 60-year-old Hedda Martin says Spectrum Health sent her a letter last week recommending she fundraise $10,000 for immunosuppressive drugs. Martin’s son started a GoFundMe campaign, and the campaign went viral after newly elected Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York tweeted about it over the holiday weekend. According to a Facebook post from Martin that has since been removed, she has raised enough money for the surgery. “I was given a challenge and I met it, so now there should be no reason to keep me off of the heart transplant list,” Martin wrote. Spectrum Health sent this statement to Michigan Radio: While we do not comment on specific patient situations to protect their privacy, Spectrum Health cares deeply about every patient that enters its doors and provides each of them the highest quality of care possible. While it is always upsetting when we cannot provide a transplant, we have an obligation to ensure that transplants are successful and that donor organs will remain viable. We thoughtfully review candidates for heart and lung transplant procedures with care and compassion, and these are often highly complex, difficult decisions. While our primary focus is the medical needs of the patient, the fact is that transplants require lifelong care and immunosuppression drugs, and therefore costs are sometimes a regrettable and unavoidable factor in the decision making process. We partner with our patients throughout their care and work closely with them to identify opportunities for financial assistance. Our clinical team has an ongoing dialogue with patients about their eligibility, holding frequent in-person meetings and informing patients in person to ensure they fully understand their specific situation. The hospital has not said how often it recommends that patients fundraise in order to receive transplants. Martin is still waiting to see if she will be eligible for a transplant, but she says if she gets one, it could extend her life expectancy up to 20 years.",Rep.

81ea2def,"In the scramble to make sense of the post-inauguration world, Amazon has been forced to restock a few key titles: Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four hit No 1 at the end of last week, after Trump’s adviser Kellyanne Conway used the phrase “alternative facts” in place of “some bullshit I just made up”. But the surprise hit – being long, complex and demanding or, as the online magazine Jezebel described it, “extremely metal” – is Hannah Arendt’s The Origins of Totalitarianism, first published in 1951. Commentators have been referencing the work since Donald Trump’s election in November but rarely has this spurred so many people to actually buy a copy. In it, the political theorist (she always explicitly rejected the term “philosopher”) details the trajectory: “antisemitism (not merely hatred of Jews), imperialism (not merely conquest), totalitarianism (not merely dictatorship)” are considered in their interrelation. Against the necessary background of imperialism, “antisemitism became the catalytic agent first for the rise of the Nazi movement … then for a world war of unparalleled ferocity and, finally, for the emergence of the unprecedented crime of genocide”. That much is well established; the chill is in the detail. When she describes the rise of the dictator, which requires a mass not a mob, you could be reading a sociologist’s thesis about Trump supporters. “The term masses applies only where we deal with people who either because of sheer numbers, or indifference, or a combination of both, cannot be integrated into any organisation based on common interest, into political parties or municipal governments or professional organisations or trade unions. Potentially, they exist in every country and form the majority of those large numbers of neutral, politically indifferent people who never join a party and hardly ever go to the polls.” She describes, quite brusquely, antisemitism at its incipience: “Whereas anti-Jewish sentiments were widespread among the educated classes of Europe throughout the 19th century, antisemitism as an ideology remained, with very few exceptions, the prerogative of crackpots in general and the lunatic fringes in particular.” Yet however you dismissed their mental capacity, this hardcore created the ideological infrastructure on which a mass movement could be built. It is strikingly reminiscent of John Naughton’s description on David Runciman’s interesting Talking Politics podcast about the “alt-right”: “People who belonged loosely to this side of the political system were essentially excluded from public discourse. But it just so happened, they didn’t go quiet. They went to the net. So, for the best part of 20 years, a network of rightwing echo chambers has been established, upon which was built the infrastructure of Trump’s campaign.” Demonstrators on Washington’s Pennsylvania Avenue during the Women’s March in January. Photograph: Joshua Lott/AFP/Getty Images Two points come out of that. First, that we can see from the comparison that the net isn’t responsible for everything. Antisemites found ways to keep their ideas alive and generative without any such advantage, and with all the same forces of conservatism and common sense ranged against them. Second, as Runciman asks, what happened to the leftwing networks? Why don’t we have effective echo chambers? It is a question that all of us have been asking, one way or another; there is no shortage of radicalism on the left. Here, Arendt brings some liberating insight, described in precis by Professor Griselda Pollock, an expert in Arendt. “She talks of the creation of pan movements, these widespread ideas that overarch national, political and ethnic elements – the two big pan movements she talks about are bolshevism and nazism. There is a single explanation for everything, and before the single explanation, everything else falls away. She gives a portrait of how you produce these isolated people, who then become susceptible to pan ideologies, which give them a place in something. But the place they have is ultimately sacrificial; they don’t count for anything; all that counts is the big idea.” The left, in other words, isn’t necessarily unequal to the task of creating a pan-ideology; but anyone who believed in pluralism or complexity would have no currency on this terrain. We should be glad not to have been effective in this space, even if it feels like a failure. Arendt was born in Germany in 1906 and was an academic until 1933, when she embarked on charity work, securing passage to Palestine for Jewish children and teenagers. The decision was not based on any sudden realisation of Hitler’s menace. “For goodness sake,” she said, laughing, in a television interview in 1964, “we didn’t need [him] to know that the Nazis were our enemies. We also knew that a large number of Germans were behind him. That could not shock us in 1933.” Rather, she had been alienated from the intellectual milieu by their “coordinated” exclusion of their Jewish colleagues (Arendt came from a family of secular Jewish lefties). “The personal problem did not lie in what our enemies did but in what our friends did,” she said. “[They were] not yet under the pressure of terror, [but] it was as if a vacuum formed around one.” She conducted the refugee work from Paris. Stripped of her German citizenship in 1937, she escaped to New York in 1941 with her husband and mother, via the Gurs internment camp in the Vichy-held south of France. She was never unclear about the magnitude of the Holocaust, saying, in the same interview: “The decisive day was when we heard about Auschwitz. Before that, we said: ‘Well, one has enemies. That is natural. Why shouldn’t people have enemies?’ But this was different. It was as if an abyss had opened. Amends can be made for almost anything, at some point in politics, but not for this.” Arendt in New York in 1972. Photograph: New York Times Co/Getty Images However, she was a controversial figure by the 1960s, following the publication of Eichmann in Jerusalem, a consideration of Adolf Eichmann’s trial and what it revealed about the nature of the Final Solution and all those who were complicit in it. Opponents accused her of making the Jews complicit in their fate. She rejected that outright – “Nowhere in this book did I accuse the Jews of failing to resist” – but said, “that the tone is predominantly ironic is completely true. [Reading Eichmann’s trial] I laughed countless times, I laughed out loud. I’d probably still laugh three minutes before my certain death.” This is the book that coined the phrase “banality of evil”, which has ramifications for both totalitarianism as a project and the pathways of resistance. But it is also a useful thumbnail of the primacy of language to her understanding of politics; cliches in the service of control, their mundanity, their mendacity, cannot but amuse her. There is also the matter of Martin Heidegger, the philosopher with whom she had a turbulent relationship in the 20s, and some other contact – its extent unclear – after the war, despite his links with the Nazi party, even justifying them (it reads like the darkest imaginable romcom – “But I love him! But he’s a Nazi. But I love him!”). Pollock guards against drawing too many of the obvious parallels between The Origins of Totalitarianism and the US’s situation today: “Islamophobia is not elaborated with the same complexity of tropes and myths as antisemitism and one shouldn’t equate them.” The work of Arendt’s that she refers to most often is the one that came directly after Origins, 1958’s The Human Condition. In the Holocaust, “we have seen the abolition of the human,” Pollock explains, “and then she has to write what would actually be an account of the human as a political creature”. Arendt has two core beliefs about the human condition (not to be confused with human nature). First, Pollock explains: “Every human life is the potential beginning of something new. Unlike animals, which are predictable – each will behave as its parents behaved – something has begun in a human that could be completely different. This is ‘natality’. As a result of that, the human condition is plural.” The consequences of this are vast: as we communicate and use language, we show ourselves to one another in our difference, and it’s in this disclosure that action is generated: we can do something to change the world. Then comes a really important dichotomy, taking its roots from Greek philosophy: the difference between this action and labour, which is what we do to survive. Work is the economic, “which comes from the Greek word oikos, which is the household. But they imagined this other source, the political, the source of speech and action.” This is what constituted, for the Greeks, the human, and through Arendt’s prism, natality and plurality are the spurs of that political self; that is, the political recognises the infinite potential of each human life, while the economic recognises only that element of the human that works, that produces. As Pollock says: “What she was afraid of was the tendency to devalue action, for the economic to overtake the political.” Taken to its logical end, the economic overtaking the political results not in the extermination camp but in the concentration camp; the difference is crucial, Pollock explains. The concentration camp exists not to extinguish life but to extinguish the human. “You are removed from moral action, you become a number and, finally, you are reduced physiologically to a bundle of reactions, as the body struggles to survive extreme emaciation.” If politics is only a set of economic decisions, then the person is no more than the work they do and the infinite preciousness of every person’s potential cascades into a brutal homogeneity, one person indivisible from the next. To put this in a modern context, “official political reality is now being enacted by the modern capitalist businessman”. Politics and economics are, in Trump, indivisible. “And although it looks wonderful that people are demonstrating, it’s actually rather frightening, because it’s generating a crisis situation in which, ultimately, the protection of law and order justifies the government in extreme measures. For some of us, it’s repeating the proto-fascist scenario.” It’s an old Leninist stunt, the generation of civil unrest in order to attack civic society. In that sense, we are all playing into Trump’s tiny hands. Mark Davis, director of the Bauman Institute in Leeds, points us towards another text, On Violence (1970). “I think that gets us closer to what’s going on at the moment,” he says. “She said in that book that violence and power are actually opposites. When institutions, particularly those of government, start to break down and lose their legitimacy, they lose their power over the everyday conduct of citizens. So what they do as a response to the loss of power is incite violence. Violence floods in to the loss of power rather than being an expression of it.” A placard at the demonstration at Downing Street in January. Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images Pollock brings us back to demonstrations and what they do to language, the slogan being a flattening out of complexity, an echo of exactly the same one-idea pan-ideology of the oversimplified worldview they protest against. I’m not sure. You can pack quite a lot into a slogan – I particularly like: “First they came for the Muslims, and we said, not today, motherfucker.” Yet I see the sense of these arguments, and wonder, what would Hannah Arendt do? Would she have marched on Downing Street? Davis is conflicted. “Certainly, I think there is a lot to be gained from people gathering together to show solidarity. But in a world where the institutions that we’re protesting in front of are losing their legitimacy and their power, I’m not sure that this has the impact that it once did. If we think of evil as this one person, this one big event, then we tend to want to match that with one big display of resistance. But actually, if evil is banal – a set of ordinary, mundane decisions day by day – then maybe we have to start living differently day by day.” I still see the point in protesting as a concrete expression of solidarity. I’d take more, if under attack, from a person who went outside than a person who signed a petition. Tangentially, I have a sudden new faith in the feminist framing of recent demonstrations as women’s marches, which does something to allay the intimation of public violence that is always used as the justification of suppression. It seems clear, nonetheless, that it isn’t enough: that perhaps Arendt’s most profound legacy is in establishing that one has to consider oneself political as part of the human condition.

,"Vaccines work. They have played a critical role in breaking the link between infection and severe outcomes, and we should express our gratitude to the scientists who developed life-saving vaccines against COVID-19 and to those who work tirelessly every day to roll out the vaccine programme at pace, across the country.  In this blog I would like to explain how we use different data sets to look at the impact of vaccination in the population.  The UK Health Security Agency is committed to openness around data and has been at the forefront of publishing evidence to show the effectiveness of the UK vaccination programme. We were first to show that COVID-19 vaccines offer high protection against the Delta variant of the virus and this data has been regularly shared with policymakers and the public.  As well as this, the UKHSA publishes rates of cases, hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status, and the data in our report shows that the rates of hospitalisation and deaths are substantially lower in fully vaccinated people, across all age groups. It is clear therefore that COVID-19 vaccines provide a high level of protection against severe outcomes.  To make our data less susceptible to misinterpretation, the UK Health Security Agency has worked with the UK Statistics Authority to update some of the data tables and descriptions in the report, specifically around rates of infection in vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. In our commitment to transparent and clear data, we regularly review our publications to ensure they reflect the current situation within the pandemic, and we will continue to work with our partners at the statistics bodies, to ensure our reporting is as scientifically robust as possible.  Case rates in vaccinated versus unvaccinated people  UKHSA publishes vaccine effectiveness by vaccine and has done for many months. This is the source that should be used to understand how effective vaccines are in the population as there is a well-established method for calculating this.  We separately publish the rates of COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths in vaccinated and unvaccinated groups by age. This is important to understand the implications of the pandemic to the NHS and to help understand where to prioritise vaccination delivery.  A simple comparison of COVID-19 case rates in those who are vaccinated and unvaccinated should not be used to assess how effective a vaccine is in preventing serious health outcomes. This is because these figures are susceptible to a number of differences between the groups, other than the vaccine itself, and these biases mean that you cannot use the rates to determine how well the vaccines work.  If we look at the numbers of cases in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated people, the rate of cases in the vaccinated people appears higher for many age groups. This is because there are key differences in the characteristics and behaviour of individuals who are vaccinated compared to those who are unvaccinated. The rates therefore reflect this population's behaviour and exposure to COVID-19, not how well the vaccines work. We also know that, as infection rates have been high over the summer, many people were previously infected, and this has had an impact on the rate of infection in recent weeks.  Several important factors can affect the rates of diagnosed COVID-19 cases and this may result in a lower rate in unvaccinated than in vaccinated people. For example:  People who are fully vaccinated may be more health conscious and therefore more likely to get tested for COVID-19 and so more likely to be identified as a case (based on the data provided by the NHS Test and Trace).  Many of those who were at the head of the queue for vaccination are those at higher risk from COVID-19 due to their age, their occupation, their family circumstances or because of underlying health issues.  People who are fully vaccinated and people who are unvaccinated may behave differently, particularly with regard to social interactions and therefore may have differing levels of exposure to COVID-19.  People who have never been vaccinated are more likely to have caught COVID-19 in the weeks or months before the period of the cases covered in the report. This gives them some natural immunity to the virus for a few months which may have contributed to a lower case rate in the past few weeks.  These factors are all accounted for in our published analyses of vaccine effectiveness which uses the test-negative case control approach. This is a recommended method of assessing vaccine effectiveness that compares the vaccination status of people who test positive for COVID-19, with those who test negative.  This method helps to control for different propensity to have a test and we are able to exclude those known to have been previously infected with COVID-19. We also control for important factors including geography, time period, ethnicity, clinical risk group, living in a care home and being a health or social care worker.  We calculate the rate of cases in people who are vaccinated by taking the number of people who have tested positive and who have been vaccinated, and comparing to the total number of people who have been vaccinated in each age group.  The denominator  To calculate the percentage of people who have been vaccinated, we need to know how many people are eligible to receive the vaccination, this is called the denominator. Although it would seem straightforward, there is a degree of uncertainty about the true denominator. The two sources that are most commonly used to derive a denominator are:  The NHS national register (called NIMS) includes everyone who registered with the NHS and is therefore eligible to be called forward for a vaccine. Although NIMS is not perfect, it represents each unique individual who is being targeted for the vaccination programme and provides the only comparable information on key criteria for those who are targeted and those who are vaccinated. One of the basic problems with NIMS is that it contains some people who were registered with the NHS but may have moved – for example overseas – but these people have not yet been removed from the database – these are often called “ghosts”. Because vaccine uptake has been so high, even a small number of additional people included in the database will inflate the number recorded as unvaccinated – so this makes the rate of COVID-19 cases in some of the younger unvaccinated groups appear lower than it should be.  The second main denominator is the Office of National Statistics (ONS) which provides an estimate of the total number of people in each age group in the middle of each year. This is based on the 2011 census, and it updates the estimates each year using other surveys and sources of data. Using this population estimate as a denominator would potentially avoid some of the “ghost” people in the younger age groups – but it would also give rise to other issues. As the ONS data is not based on a list of unique individuals, it does not allow linking of a COVID-19 case to an individual’s vaccination status. This limits any analysis of uptake by some key criteria. As well as this, the current estimates seem to be undercounting in some older age groups. As rates of COVID-19 in older people are those we need to be most concerned about, because these age groups are at highest risk of hospitalisation and death – using the ONS denominator gives some inconsistent age-specific rates for these more severe outcomes.  Neither is perfect, however for estimating rates of cases by vaccination status we consider that using NIMS to identify those who are vaccinated and those who are unvaccinated is the best way to provide stable and comparable data, even though we accept that the infection rates in unvaccinated younger groups may seem lower than the true figure. These figures are useful for planning, for example in understanding workload in hospitals, but should not be used for assessing how effective the vaccine is. Vaccine effectiveness analysis of routine data is only possible by using the variables coded in NIMS and available at an individual level for all people who come forward for a test.  What data should we be looking at?  Data on COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths is much less prone to bias, as testing is more complete, and so it is more valid to compare rates for these severe outcomes. But even so a properly conducted analysis is much more reliable, as explained above.  Our publication of COVID-19 vaccine surveillance data is consistent with all the other vaccine surveillance data we publish and this consistency is important for understanding the patterns we see across all of our surveillance data sources. We have consistently published the data in this way, aligned to other vaccine surveillance data, since early in the year.  We believe that transparency - coupled with explanation – remains the best way to deal with misinformation. UKHSA has been committed to regular publishing of our vaccine effectiveness data and sharing this evidence promptly with others – this has played a huge role in increasing vaccine confidence in this country and worldwide.",Transparency and data – UKHSA’s vaccines report,true,75714273335803486870707476272699141063

Researchers, led by University of Colorado-Boulder professor of aerospace engineering sciences Steve Nerem, used satellite data dating to 1993 to observe the levels of the world's oceans.  Changes in sea level observed between 1992 and 2014. Orange/red colors represent higher sea levels, while blue colors show where sea levels are lower.  Using satellite data rather than tide-gauge data that is normally used to measure sea levels allows for more precise estimates of global sea level, since it provides measurements of the open ocean.  The team observed a total rise in the ocean of 7 centimeters (2.8 inches) in 25 years of data, which aligns with the generally accepted current rate of sea level rise of about 3 millimeters (0.1 inches) per year.

,"The flag of the Interior Department's deputy secretary, bottom, flew last week above the headquarters building in downtown Washington. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)  At the Interior Department’s headquarters in downtown Washington, Secretary Ryan Zinke has revived an arcane military ritual that no one can remember ever happening in the federal government.  A security staffer takes the elevator to the seventh floor, climbs the stairs to the roof and hoists a special secretarial flag whenever Zinke enters the building. When the secretary goes home for the day or travels, the flag — a blue banner emblazoned with the agency’s bison seal flanked by seven white stars representing the Interior bureaus — comes down.  In Zinke’s absence, the ritual is repeated to raise an equally obscure flag for Deputy Secretary David Bernhardt.  Responding this week to questions from The Washington Post, a spokeswoman for Zinke, a former Navy SEAL commander, defended the Navy flag-flying tradition as “a major sign of transparency.”  “Ryan Zinke is proud and honored to lead the Department of the Interior, and is restoring honor and tradition to the department, whether it’s flying the flag when he is in garrison or restoring traditional access to public lands,” press secretary Heather Swift said in an email.    Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke speaks at the Heritage Foundation in Washington last month. At right is his special secretarial flag. (Zach Gibson/Bloomberg News)  Zinke, a Stetson-wearing former Montana congressman who has cultivated an image as a rugged outdoorsman, has come under a harsh spotlight in recent weeks for behavior criticized as extravagant for a public official. The agency’s inspector general opened an investigation after he ran up bills for travel on chartered jets and mixed business with political appearances, sometimes accompanied by his wife, Lola. It’s one of five probes underway of Cabinet secretaries’ travel.  Zinke upset some of the 70,000 employees at the agency that manages public lands by stating that 30 percent of the workers are “not loyal to the flag” in a speech to oil and gas executives. It is unclear whether the reference was literal or figurative.  Zinke rode to work on horseback on his first day in office and displays animal heads on his wood-paneled office walls. For a while, he kept a glass-case display of hunting knives but was asked to remove them because of security risks, according to people familiar with the decision.  He has commissioned commemorative coins with his name on them to give to staff and visitors, but the cost to taxpayers is unclear. Zinke’s predecessors and some other Cabinet secretaries have coins bearing agency seals, but not personalized ones.  The flag ritual is unique in President Trump’s administration. The White House does not raise the presidential flag when Trump alights at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. There is no defense secretary’s flag atop the Pentagon.  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, like his predecessors, has a personal flag that flies beside the U.S. flag in front of the department’s Foggy Bottom headquarters. But it’s there whether Tillerson is in the building or not.  “We’re talking about Cabinet members and federal buildings, not the Queen of England and Buckingham Palace,” said Chris Lu, deputy labor secretary in the Obama administration, referring to the British tradition of announcing the queen’s presence by raising her personal heraldic flag.    Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke commissioned commemorative coins with his name on them to give to staff and visitors. (Obtained by The Washington Post)  “If we had a secretarial flag at the Obama Labor Department, we never bothered to locate it or use it,” Lu said.  Retired Army Col. Steven Warren, who ran the Pentagon’s press operation before retiring this year, could not recall the place in Washington hierarchy represented by the raising of a federal official’s personal flag.  “Is he trying to send a message?” Warren wondered.  “Is he big on pomp and circumstance, or is this a case of ‘Look at me?’ ”  Personal flags for federal government officials have a proud, if arcane, history that originated with the secretary of the Navy in 1866, to help sailing ships in the fleet recognize which one carried the naval commander. The Coast Guard and secretary of war wanted one, too.  By the early 20th century, the civilian heads of the Treasury, Commerce and Labor departments had flags.  The first one for Interior was adopted in 1917.  “If you were the secretary of agriculture, you asked yourself, ‘Hey, the secretary of war has a flag, how come I don’t have one?’ ” said Joseph McMillan, a retired Defense Department official and student of flag history from Alexandria who is president of the American Heraldry Society.  The flags proliferated by World War II, with banners for subordinate officials from undersecretaries to assistant attorneys general.  Back when security was not a concern, official government vehicles would display a high-ranking official’s personal flag on its left front fender, with the American flag flanking the right. They were considered pretentious, McMillan said, and eventually went out of fashion.  At Lady Liberty Flag and Flagpole in Austin, one of the largest flag vendors for federal offices, Sandra Dee Merritt said she sells 300 to 500 department flags a year to various Interior offices.  Secretarial flags are no longer in demand. “I haven’t sold any of those individual secretarial flags to any agency in forever,” Merritt said.  Raising a personal flag to mark an official’s presence remains a custom in the military. Field commanders often display their unit’s flag when they are at headquarters to signify that the boss is in.  But the personal flag, whether belonging to a general or a Cabinet secretary, stays behind the desk, if it’s there at all.  By flying his flag, Zinke is doing exactly what the flag was designed for, McMillan said. Yet he’s skeptical. The Interior Department is not the Navy.  “I’m all about tradition,” McMillan said. “But I kind of have an aversion to militarizing everything in our government. The world doesn’t need to know the secretary of the Interior is in the building.”",Where’s Zinke? The interior secretary’s special flag offers clues.,true,203655781341374058380057958672027257278
,"What are the Covid variants and do vaccines still work? By Michelle Roberts  Health editor, BBC News online Published 11 March  Image source, Getty Images  The Omicron variant has become the dominant type of coronavirus circulating in many countries, overtaking previous variants, such as Delta.  It can be contagious, even if you have been vaccinated. But current vaccines are still providing good protection against severe illness.  What is Omicron?  A variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world, which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.  Omicron is strikingly different from some other Covid variants, and the one that started the pandemic, because of the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone.  In particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.  This could make it better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infections with Covid. Omicron does appear to be highly spreadable, even in those who have been fully jabbed.  There are several types or sublineages of Omicron - including BA.1.1.529 and BA.2 - that have slightly different mutations from each other.  The World Health Organization says mounting evidence suggests BA.2 is proving to be a bit more transmissible than the others.  Is it worse than other variants?  The evidence shows Omicron infections tend to be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.  That is largely down to the amount of protection or immunity that people have built against Covid from past infections and vaccination, rather than changes to the virus itself.  Even so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.  Are current vaccines good enough?  Preliminary lab studies found two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough, which is why some countries, including the UK, are giving people extra doses to boost their immunity.  UK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.  As with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or who have significant underlying health conditions.  Although current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron, they are still the best line of defence against Covid.  They have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma.  Doctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants.  How quickly could we get new vaccines against variants?  Updated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.  Manufacturers could scale up production quickly too, and regulators have already discussed how to fast-track the approval process.  Moderna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March, although lab tests in animals suggest they may offer little advantage over standard shots.  What about the other variants?  The most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern.  Why do variants occur?  Viruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce, but they aren't perfect at it. Errors creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus.  If this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive.  The more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur.",What are the Covid variants and do vaccines still work?,true,172682222853544419301558447842241904950
,"The US Food and Drug Administration on Monday fully approved the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid shot, triggering a new wave of vaccine mandates as the Delta variant batters the country.  Around 52 percent of the American population is fully vaccinated, but health authorities have hit a wall of vaccine hesitant people, impeding the national campaign.  In a televised address, President Joe Biden called FDA approval the ""gold standard"" in evidence.  ""Today I'm calling on... more companies in the private sector to step up with vaccine requirements that will reach millions more people,"" he said.  Pfizer's vaccine, which will now be marketed under its brand name Comirnaty, is the first to receive full approval.  More than 200 million Pfizer shots have already been administered under an emergency use authorization (EUA) that was granted on December 11, 2020.  The decision to fully approve it among people aged 16 and up was based on updated data from the drug's clinical trial involving more than 40,000 people, which found the vaccine 91 percent effective in preventing Covid.  The FDA tracked data from 12,000 vaccine recipients six months out from their vaccine series.  Most commonly reported side effects were mild and included pain and swelling at the injection site as well as headache, chills and fever.  The agency is continuing to investigate safety data regarding the highly rare but more worrisome condition myocarditis (heart inflammation), particularly within seven days after the second dose.  The highest risk has been detected in boys aged 12 through 17, with available data suggesting most individuals recover but some require intensive care.  - Military, NYC announce mandates -  The US military said shortly after the announcement that it would mandate the vaccine, and a slew of private businesses and universities are expected to follow.  New York City also said it would require all its department of education employees to receive at least one dose of vaccine by September 27, without the option for regular testing instead.  Story continues  The vaccine remains available under emergency use authorization to children aged 12 to 15, but because it has now been fully approved, physicians may prescribe it to children under 12 if they believe it will be beneficial.  But Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock recommended against so called ""off-label"" use in younger children until clinical trials report their data, which is expected later this year.  ""We need to get the information and data on usage in younger children -- they are not just small adults,"" she told reporters, emphasizing that knowing the correct dosage for this group was key.  - Boost for vaccination campaign -  Experts hailed the development, which many had been urging for months.  Amesh Adalja of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security hailed the development as ""good news"" that may sway people still on the fence.  ""One of the talking points of the anti-vaccine movement which has falsely claimed that this was an 'experimental vaccine' has been removed,"" he told AFP.  Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, added he expected to see ""tens of millions more Americans vaccinated"" as a result of new mandates.  A recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found 30 percent of adults said full approval would make them more likely to get vaccinated.  The approval came as the ultra-contagious Delta variant pummels the country, with around 80,000 Americans hospitalized with Covid and more than 700 dying every day.  The hardest hit regions include southern states Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.  The vaccination rate has risen in these states in recent weeks, but the national rate is still well below its peak from spring.  Some 628,000 people have died from coronavirus infection in the United States, making it officially the hardest hit country in the world -- though experts say it is possible that India may in fact hold the record.  Vaccines are less effective against the Delta variant than they were against previous strains, particularly against infection, making the goal of high population level vaccination critical.  The Biden administration announced last week plans to make a booster shot immediately available for immuno-compromised people, and recommended all vaccinated people get a third shot eight months after their second.  ia/dw","US grants Pfizer Covid vaccine full approval, triggering new mandates",true,32290698902611132987502018405415492570
dfb72ca1,"A U.S. ambassador on Wednesday explicitly linked President Trump, Vice President Pence and other senior officials to what he came to believe was a campaign to pressure a foreign government to investigate Trump’s political rival in exchange for a coveted White House meeting and hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid. The potentially historic, if hotly disputed, testimony from U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland is the most damaging yet for Trump in Congress’s intensifying inquiry into whether the president should be impeached. More forcefully than he has before, Sondland declared that the Trump administration would not give Ukraine’s newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, a chance to visit the White House — unless Zelensky agreed to announce investigations that could help the president politically. “I know that members of this committee frequently frame these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a ‘quid pro quo’?” Sondland said. “. . . With regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes.” Sondland came to Capitol Hill as perhaps the most anticipated witness of the Democrats’ inquiry — a longtime Republican donor and Trump loyalist whose shifting accounts made it unclear which side of the political aisle his testimony might benefit more. He said after the hearing that he intended to stay in his post. But nearly from the moment his testimony began, it was clear he was ready to cast aspersions not just on the president, but also on the highest-ranking officials in his government. Sondland acknowledged that he and others were the ones pushing Ukrainians to announce investigations, but asserted they had merely “followed the president’s orders,” communicated through Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. Sondland testified that top-level officials — including Pence, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — were made aware at various points of what was happening, and he provided emails to back up his assertions.","Wisconsin ACT scores plummet Newly released information from the Department of Instruction shows a dramatic decline in student ACT results in the past year. Test scores dropped Wisconsin from 2nd in the country to 41st in the nation among states where more than half the students took the exam. “The latest information released today is another glaring failure of the Walker Administration to make sound, smart policy decisions to improve education in our state,” Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Martha Laning said on Thursday. “As a parent with children who have recently graduated from high school I’ve had a front row seat to the destructive changes that have short-changed our children and their futures. When budget cuts force schools to do more with less it’s no surprise that the quality of the education our children receive inevitably declines.” In last year’s State of the State address, Governor Scott Walker claimed his education policies were working, boasting that “ACT scores are up and Wisconsin now ranks second in the country.” Now, five days away from Walker’s next State of the State it’s clear that the policies of the last six years have failed schools, students, and parents. Out of a top score of 36, the average test score in the state dropped from 22.0 to 20.0, which pulls Wisconsin to dead last in the Midwest and tied with Kentucky for 41st in the entire country. Due to funding cuts, damage has been made to Wisconsin’s traditionally high-quality education system and now our kids, businesses and communities will suffer. Nationally, Wisconsin saw the fourth largest cut to K-12 general school aid funding in 2015-16 according to the nonpartisan research policy institute, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. While Wisconsin has traditionally ranked above average in terms of ACT scores, these latest numbers place Wisconsin dead last in the Midwest and among the bottom ten states nationally. “I can only empathize with the parents across the state who see this news and grow ever more concerned with the direction of our state. Our kids deserve the same high-quality education we had as kids and the choices the legislature has made is stealing that from them..” said Laning. “The state of education in Wisconsin is not strong. The newest numbers should be a wake-up call to the governor and the Republican legislature that their misguided priorities are hurting our education system and, therefore, our kids, businesses and communities.”",true,
4ace902e,"Dan Jarvis: Winter death toll should shame coldest of hearts THE Office for National Statistics has released figures showing that a staggering 24,300 people died from mostly preventable causes over the course of winter last year. Fuel poverty must be tackled before more elderly people die needlessly, says Barnsley MP Dan Jarvis. Over the last five years, more than 152,000 of the most vulnerable people up and down the country have died over the winter months. That’s like losing a city the size of York in just five short years. In a modern Britain that’s completely unacceptable. Yet – to a greater or lesser degree – both Labour and Tory governments have seemed to simply accept that thousands of older, vulnerable people will die every winter because they can’t properly heat their homes, or get the care and support they need. That has to be a source of great shame for us all. So-called excess winter deaths are calculated by measuring the number of people who die during the period between November and March every year, and comparing that figure against the summer months. In common with most countries, in Britain more people die over winter than summer. However, our record compared with much colder countries like Germany and Norway is poor. Even across the UK there are huge differences in the numbers affected, with people in the South West much more likely to die during winter than in the East of England. All too many deaths over the winter are preventable; better heating, health and housing are the key to reducing excess winter deaths. It’s time to address this quiet crisis. Some of the stories from those most at risk over the winter months are heartbreaking, like 83-year-old William - a low income pensioner struggling to get by, having to choose between heating and eating. William has served in the Royal Navy, but he is now reduced to living in a home he describes as a ‘shack’ – which the local hospital warns may kill him. He suffers with respiratory problems and has to keep his flat warm to protect his health, but the money he spends on heating often stop him from putting a decent meal on the table. The mark of a civilised society is how we treat people like William. This is a problem we can – and must – solve, but it’s also a problem that no government has paid enough attention to. That’s why I’m calling on Theresa May and Jeremy Hunt to come up with a credible, ambitious, cross-government strategy that helps people stay safe over winter. While the Government has responded to my criticisms by pointing to their ‘Cold Weather Plan’, that ‘Plan’ fails to direct all of the many resources of government to addressing this problem. If their Cold Weather Plan was effective we would not have seen so many thousands of unnecessary deaths since it was introduced in 2011. Solving the excess winter deaths crisis is not just the responsibility of the NHS. All too often our Health Service is called in to help older or vulnerable people only when their situations have become life threatening. If we are to take the pressure off the NHS, Government ministers must take action to deal with the cold homes and fuel poverty that drive so many people to need medical help over winter. Neither, as the Government may have you believe, can this problem simply be left up to the energy companies to fix. Of course energy companies must offer a fair deal for customers, particularly those living in fuel poverty, but it is the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, and the energy regulator – Ofgem – that have the ability to properly regulate the energy market. No one claims that all of the solutions to the excess winter deaths crisis are easy. Yet many of those solutions are within reach of government ministers if they had the political will to grasp them: better insulation for colder homes, more help for those living in fuel poverty, and support for lonely or isolated people to connect with their local communities. Yet in the face of 152,000 older, vulnerable people dying from largely preventable causes over just five years, this Government is still failing to offer real or meaningful action. They must take excess winter deaths seriously but their response so far has been nothing short of complacent and irresponsible. And it’s costing lives. That’s why I’m engaging with the major energy companies, housing providers and charities to address this problem and challenging them to do more this winter to reduce excess winter months and protect our most vulnerable friends and neighbours. If we want to save lives this winter, we need action now. And I, for one, am determined to make sure we get it.",Bonfire of the Insanities,true,

,"Health workers with previous Covid-19 infections had six times the immune response to one dose of the Pfizer jab than those who hadn't had the virus. The researchers said this emphasised the importance of people having their second dose to provide the same ""booster"" effect. Those who have had Covid should still have a second jab, though, to ensure ""longer-lasting"" protection. Giving the previously-infected one dose would not be efficient, experts say. Having two jabs gives the best chance of activating all parts of the immune system and potentially protecting against new variants. The study, funded by the Department of Health and Social Care, was an extension of Public Health England's Siren study of healthcare workers.While a second dose was ""vital"" for long-term cover, the Department of Health and Social Care said the findings showed even a single dose gave strong protection in 99% of the 237 health workers studied. Prof Eleanor Riley, at the University of Edinburgh, said this provided ""considerable reassurance that the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation's somewhat controversial decision to recommend a 12-week interval between Covid-19 vaccine doses is a safe, effective and pragmatic approach to maximising public health given current constraints"". T-cell protection Most studies just look at people's antibody response, but this research also measured participants' T-cells. This harder-to-measure part of our immune system tends to respond to lots of different parts of the virus's ""spike"", making it important for protecting against mutations.The vaccine is designed to help your body recognise the virus if it encounters it in the wild, but as the virus mutates it begins to look subtly different, making it harder for the body to recognise. For people who have not had Covid, the first dose of the vaccine provided protection equivalent to having had the virus. But for people who had had Covid in the past, the first dose gave them six times the T-cell response and almost seven times the antibody response, compared with so-called Covid ""naive"" people who had never been infected. And their antibodies were better at neutralising the virus completely, making it much less likely these individuals would be able to pass the virus on to others. Single dose only? These findings ""inevitably"" lead to debate about ""whether vaccine supplies could be stretched further by offering only a single dose to those known to have been previously infected,"" said Prof Danny Altmann at Imperial College, London. ""For most of the world, including the UK, there may be sufficient diagnostic uncertainty as to who was definitely infected to make this approach hard to implement efficiently."" Prof Susanna Dunachie, one of the study leaders from the University of Oxford, said the team also found that vaccination ""improves the breadth of T-cell responses generated in a previously infected individual"". In other words, even if you've had Covid, the vaccine will make you more likely to maintain protection against new mutations of the virus. ""It's still important that everyone follows NHS guidelines to get two doses of the vaccine, even if you think you may have previously had Covid-19,"" she said. The researchers pitted cells from participants' blood against different variants of the virus in the lab. Vaccinated healthcare workers were less able to fight off variants, particularly the South African strain, than the original strain the vaccine is based on. But this effect was less in people with infection-acquired immunity plus a single dose of the vaccine. This implies a second booster dose could work in the same way, providing better protection against the virus as it mutates - although this is yet to be proven.",Covid: Past infection increases vaccine response six-fold,true,282119882302258498031836624049095603395

,"AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford today announced an agreement for the global development and distribution of the University’s potential recombinant adenovirus vaccine aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection from SARS-CoV-2.  The collaboration aims to bring to patients the potential vaccine known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, being developed by the Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group, at the University of Oxford. Under the agreement, AstraZeneca would be responsible for development and worldwide manufacturing and distribution of the vaccine.  Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, AstraZeneca, said: “As COVID-19 continues its grip on the world, the need for a vaccine to defeat the virus is urgent. This collaboration brings together the University of Oxford’s world-class expertise in vaccinology and AstraZeneca’s global development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities. Our hope is that, by joining forces, we can accelerate the globalisation of a vaccine to combat the virus and protect people from the deadliest pandemic in a generation.”  Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, AstraZeneca, said: “The University of Oxford and AstraZeneca have a longstanding relationship to advance basic research and we are hugely excited to be working with them on advancing a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 around the world. We are looking forward to working with the University of Oxford and innovative companies such as Vaccitech, as part of our new partnership.”  Alok Sharma, UK Business Secretary, said: “This collaboration between Oxford University and AstraZeneca is a vital step that could help rapidly advance the manufacture of a coronavirus vaccine. It will also ensure that, should the vaccine being developed by Oxford University’s Jenner Institute work, it will be available as early as possible, helping to protect thousands of lives from this disease.”  Professor Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University, said: “Our partnership with AstraZeneca will be a major force in the struggle against pandemics for many years to come. We believe that together we will be in a strong position to start immunising against coronavirus once we have an effective approved vaccine. Sadly, the risk of new pandemics will always be with us and the new research centre will enhance the world’s preparedness and our speed of reaction the next time we face such a challenge.”  Professor Louise Richardson, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, said: “Like my colleagues all across Oxford, I am deeply proud of the work of our extraordinarily talented team of academics in the Jenner Institute and the Oxford Vaccine Group. They represent the best tradition of research, teaching and contributing to the world around us, that has been the driving mission of the University of Oxford for centuries. Like people all across the country, we are wishing them success in developing an effective vaccine. If they are successful, our partnership with AstraZeneca will ensure that the British people and people across the world, especially in low and middle income countries, will be protected from this terrible virus as quickly as possible.”  The potential vaccine entered Phase I clinical trials last week to study safety and efficacy in healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years, across five trial centres in Southern England. Data from the Phase I trial could be available next month. Advancement to late-stage trials should take place by the middle of this year.  ChAdOx1 nCoV-19  Developed at the University of Oxford’s Jenner Institute, and working with the Oxford Vaccine Group, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 uses a viral vector based on a weakened version of the common cold (adenovirus) containing the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, which primes the immune system to attack COVID-19 if it later infects the body.

We begin tonight with breaking news. President Trump has just said for the first time that he will likely not let former White House counsel Don McGahn comply with the subpoena to testify before the House Judiciary Committee as part of its obstruction of justice investigation.    (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)    DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, I've had him testifying already for 30 hours.    INTERVIEWER: So is the answer no?    TRUMP: It's really -- I don't think I could let him and then tell everybody else you can't but especially him because he was a counsel. So they testified for many hours, all of them. Many, many, many people.    INTERVIEWER: So, as far as you're concerned it's kind of done, it's done?    (CROSSTALK)    TRUMP: And the others can't.    INTERVIEWER: So, is it done?    TRUMP: I would say it's done. We've been through this. Nobody has ever done what I've done. I've given total transparency. It's never happened before like this.    INTERVIEWER: So Congress should be --    TRUMP: They shouldn't be looking anymore. This is all -- it's done.    (END VIDEO CLIP)    COOPER: Hasn't given total transparency, but that's obvious.    It's done, he says. The president all but saying he'll exert executive privilege to block the testimony, although it remains an open question if he can claim executive privilege at this point given that McGahn has already testified, we'll ask Senator Mazie Hirono about that coming up, as well as our legal team.    All of this comes after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and some heated words directed at another man who did testify on Capitol Hill yesterday.    (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)    REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): The attorney general of the United States of America was not telling the truth to the Congress of the United States. That's a crime.    (END VIDEO CLIP)    COOPER: A crime, which is quite an accusation. A Justice Department spokeswoman called Pelosi's comments reckless and false. Her tough talk as Barr refusing to show up today before the same committee that wants to talk to McGahn, the House Judiciary Committee. Instead, there was an empty chair. There were no questions, no answers and a chicken.    That's right, chicken. One Democrat on the committee call the attorney general chicken Barr for not showing up and chowed down on some KFC.    It has been that kind of a day and it's that kind of a night.    Let's go to Kaitlan Collins at the White House.    So, what else did the president say, Kaitlan?    KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Anderson, we saw the president tonight draw the clearest line between not letting McGahn testify and not letting really anyone testify. In the last few weeks as he talked about this tactic of fighting all these subpoenas, he hasn't brought up his former White House counsel specifically, but he did so tonight.    But, Anderson, one thing we didn't hear from the president was this criticism that he has been saying privately about Don McGahn, especially after the Mueller report came out and McGahn was a central figure in it when he said that essentially the president had told him to fire the special counsel, something that the president and the attorney general are both now disputing.    COOPER: Do we know if the White House plans to block any other presidential adviser or executive branch officials from testifying? It sounds like they're going to block them all if they can.    COLLINS: That's what the president seemed to be getting there. Essentially, if he lets McGahn testify, then other cabinet officials or West Wing officials, he's going to have to let them testify, too.    Now the president seemed to get out ahead a little bit of his legal team here, because they've been discussing privately what they're going to do about the subpoena for Don McGahn, how they can block him from testifying at all or block certain parts of it, but the president seemed to go farther than they have, what they have even been saying privately about not letting McGahn testify at all. Whether or not he can actually do that, it doesn't seem to be a conclusion that the White House has come to yet.    COOPER: All right. Kaitlan Collins, thanks very much.    I want to get reaction to all this now from a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono joins us now.    Senator Hirono, you hear --    SEN. MAZIE HIRONO (D-HI): Good evening.    COOPER: Good evening.    You hear the president saying he doesn't plan or he doesn't think it likely to let Don McGahn testify before Congress. He already let him testify for 30 hours before the special counsel. The whole thing is done.    What do you say to that?    HIRONO: What I say is we should always remember that there are two things that the president cares most about. One is protecting himself. The second is money.    So he is in the process of protecting himself. You can explain a lot of what the president does by knowing that he will do anything to protect himself.    COOPER: So is there -- what is the option? If he exerts executive privilege, what, it just goes to the courts?    HIRONO: I think that's one of the modus operandi of Trump when he was in business, that he would delay things. He would file lawsuits, or he will file for bankruptcy, leaving everybody holding the bag. He treats the presidency like he is still running a business in the kind of ways that he ran his business, which are very questionable tactics.    So I think, yes, I don't think it bothers him very much if he asserts executive privilege over somebody who has already testified and have them that go to the courts and hope that it gets strung up through the election. He does not care about that sort of thing.    COOPER: Speaker Pelosi said today that Attorney General Barr lied in his testimony and committed a crime in front of you and the rest of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I'm wondering if you agree with her. And if so, is there anything to do about it? Because Senate Democrats obviously don't have the majority to force any kind of recourse.    HIRONO: Well, that's a sad thing. And if we had Republicans in the Senate who have cared about truth as much as I would hope they would, then we'd be able to get somewhere. [20:05:05] But thankfully, the House is in Democratic hands, and as    Speaker Pelosi said, he -- Barr lied regarding his answer to the question from Charlie Crist and also on the Senate side, in his response to Chris Van Hollen.    COOPER: I want to play your answers you had in response to the attorney general yesterday. I just want to play this.    (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)    HIRONO: From the beginning, you were addressing an audience of one, that person being Donald Trump.    But now we know more about your deep involvement in trying to cover up for Donald Trump. Being attorney general of the United States is a sacred trust. You have betrayed that trust. America deserves better.    You should resign. I think you know what I'm talking about. Please, please, Mr. Attorney General. Give us some credit for knowing what the hell is going on around here with you.    SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Not really -- to this line of questioning. Listen, you slandered this man --    BARR: What I sort of want to know is, how do we get to this point?    HIRONO: I do not think I'm slandering anyone.    GRAHAM: All I would say --    HIRONO: Mr. Chairman, I am done. Thank you very much.    GRAHAM: And you slandered this man from top to bottom. So if you want more of this, you're not going to get it. If you want to ask him questions, you can.    HIRONO: Certainly have your opinion.    UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    (END VIDEO CLIP)    COOPER: Were you surprised to hear senator graham saying you slandered the attorney general?    HIRONO: Well, truth is a defense of slander and opinion is not slander. So, but we saw the chairman going off and he did that.    But the only person who can sue me for that, not to mention as legislators, we have some protections as to what we say, but the only person who can sue me is Barr. So there you go.    It was very disheartening yesterday to watch and listen to the attorney general of the United States act like he is a defense attorney for the president. He did that very well. What he didn't do very well was be honest with the people of our country. And that is why he's not the only time he's very good at obfuscating and skirting questions. He couldn't even answer my questions whether it was OK for the White House counsel to be told to fire Mueller and then to lie about it, whether it was OK to dangle pardons before witnesses and all of that.    He wouldn't answer that. He kept going back to the criminality aspects of it. So, I call this -- there is a moral dead zone in the Trump White House.    COOPER: You know, the Republicans will push back and say, well, look, you know, you and others have said the attorney general is acting like the president's lawyer, not the attorney general for the people of the United States and for the United States. Republicans pushed back and that and said, look, Bobby Kennedy was the attorney general under JFK. He was clearly aligned with JFK. They say Eric Holder was close to President Obama, was clearly in their opinion watching out for President Obama.    The idea being that what Barr is doing, whatever you may think of it, is not that dissimilar from what past attorneys general have done.    HIRONO: That's what they'd like everybody to think. But you have an attorney general who auditioned for the job by writing a totally unasked for 19-page document that said a sitting president cannot be charged with obstruction of justice. That's about half of the Mueller report, part two, basically.    And guess what? When the Mueller report comes out and Mueller says there are these indicators and factors relating to an obstruction of justice charge, he couldn't come to a decision on that, but leaving it as it was and Barr jumps in and says, oh, well, there is no obstruction there. Very much like his 19-pager.    And then you have the attorney general who puts out a four-page -- first, he called ate summary, then it's really not a sum risks and then we find out in a bombshell that just a few days that we find out that Mueller had contacted and written to Barr saying you have not characterized our work accurately. And then you have the attorney general before all this comes out regarding the Mueller letter, you have the attorney general having a press conference.    COOPER: Yes.    HIRONO: -- to make the president look good.    What is that? Let's talk about what we're confronted with in the here and now. We have an attorney general who is acting like the defense attorney for the president. He should have taken that job as defense attorney when the president offered it to him.    COOPER: Justice Department will allow Mueller to testify? I mean, obviously, not to the Senate, because Lindsey Graham has made it clear he won't ask Mueller to testify, but at the house.    HIRONO: I think when Barr was asked that, I think he said he doesn't see why not, but I think there will be why-nots because maybe the president will put some pressure on his attorney general to say he doesn't want anybody testifying.    [20:10:06] As far as the president and Lindsey Graham are concerned, it's all over.    It is not all over because we need to get to the bottom of what's going on here. So, you know, the House thankfully is proceeding with their investigation, and I think the next step for Jerry Nadler is to issue a subpoena for Barr to testify, and we all know that he's talking with Mueller directly about Mueller testifying and whether or not the president can force everyone not to testify, that lead to more lawsuits. This is what the president wants.    COOPER: Yes. Senator Mazie Hirono, appreciate your time. Thank you.    HIRONO: Sure.    COOPER: Joining us now, CNN chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, former federal prosecutor Robert Ray, who served as part of the Whitewater independent counsel, also Elliot Williams, former deputy assistant attorney general during the Obama administration, and CNN political analyst Kirsten Powers.    Jeff, the president saying he doesn't think he'll allow former White House Don -- or that he can't allow McGahn to testify before Congress. Can he exert executive privilege here? Was that de facto waived when McGahn testified to Mueller?    JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: I don't think he can cite it anymore because he's twice had the opportunity to prevent the disclosure of McGahn's testimony. First, he allowed McGahn to be interviewed by Mueller, and then presented with the Mueller report, chose not to object to the disclosures that McGahn made. And that to me is a waiver of executive privilege.    Putting aside the issue of whether he could do it at all, but this seems to be an absolutely clear case of waiver. And once you allow a privilege to be violated, any privilege, whether it's a marital privilege or religious privilege or executive pilgrimage, you can't then say oh, by the way, now I want to protect the information that might be covered.    So I think if it goes to court, he'll lose. He'll be able to delay it. But I think he'll lose.    COOPER: Robert, do you agree he would lose in court?    ROBERT RAY, FORMER WHITEWATER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL: Not so sure about that. I know -- I respect Jeffrey's view. I know that Jerry Nadler is of a similar view. In fact, we raised it, Anderson, you and I when he was on set me I guess several weeks ago. I think it's one thing to say that, you know, within the executive branch was sort of the first round of this, I don't think there can be a waiver.    The only place where a waiver arguably occurs is the point at which the White House and in this instance the attorney general decide to release the redacted Mueller report containing that information to the Congress and thereby ultimately to the American people.    However, while Jeffrey's right that generally speaking, this issue is one where, you know, waiver does apply, it gets a little more complicated when you're talking about separation of powers issues, and specifically, on the question of how far does that waiver extend. In other words, there is a general principle about subject matter waiver, and I would agree that with regard to those portions of McGahn's prior statements that are made during the course of the investigation, but courts because of separation of powers principles, at least in my experience, take a very narrow view of that waiver when it involves the two branches of government in a dispute.    So it's not quite the same as looking at, you know, marital privilege or attorney-client privilege. There is another complicating feature here.    COOPER: Let me bring Kirsten.    The president can say over and over again that this investigation is done. Democrats are certainly going to continue to issue subpoenas, continue to push for more answers. The administration will continue to fight them. Where does this go, do you think?    KIRSTEN POWERS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, it's pretty clear the administration is just trying to drag their feet on this, right? They want to drag things out for as listening as they possibly can. That's not an unusual response from administrations that are being investigated by Congress, but I think that a lot of the fury about this and Democrats really wanting an investigation above and beyond what you would normally see is because of how this has been handled.    I think that it's been handled so dishonestly by the attorney general by putting out this summary, and now pretending to be completely confused by the fact that people are upset when you actually get the report that it says something quite different than in fact Mueller had expressed that he didn't feel this was an accurate reflection, and he under oath didn't disclose that, and in fact misled people in another direction. And so, I think it's just -- it's just going to cause Democrats to get more and more fired up about this because they feel like they haven't gotten any answers.    COOPER: Elliot, though, I mean, can the president exert executive privilege over a private citizen, Don McGahn? Couldn't Don McGahn just say I'm going to go and testify?    ELLIOT WILLIAMS, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL, OBAMA ADMINISTRATION: See, the complication here, and this is similar to what Robert was getting at is he is a private citizen, but you're talking about things that happened when he was White House counsel.    [20:15:06] But here is the thing. We're getting -- we're getting into this question of executive privilege that will be sorted out in the courts. And the much bigger issue is this is all indicative -- this is what Kirsten had said -- all indicative of an intent to frustrate the will of Congress and the frustrate congressional oversight. The president has said from the beginning, I'm going to instruct    people not to testify and not to comply with the subpoenas. Just in the last week, the House Oversight Committee saw witnesses not comply with subpoenas related to I believe the census and White House security clearance, and on and on and on. This extends across the administration.    So while Don McGahn is sort of the executive privilege du jour, what this really is an attempt to just not comply with what Congress -- and it's a different investigative body. It's not the special counsel.    COOPER: Yes, everyone, stay with us. I have to take a break. I want to get the group's take on the speaker of the house accusing the nation's top cop of breaking the law. Democrat Nancy Pelosi went there. The question is, where does that political fight go next?    I'll also get reaction from Capitol Hill from a member of the House Judiciary Committee, the same committee President Trump is likely blocking his White House counsel from testifying before.    Lots to discuss with Democratic Congressman Ted Lieu tonight.    (COMMERCIAL BREAK)    [20:20:22] COOPER: Our breaking news. President Trump says he will likely block former White House counsel Don McGahn from complying with the House Judiciary Committee subpoena to answer questions in front of its obstruction of justice probe.    Now, this hours after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi went on attack against America's top law enforcement official, saying this.    (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)    REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): He lied to Congress. He lied to Congress. If anybody else did that, it would be considered a crime. Nobody is above the law, not the president of the United States and not the attorney general.    (END VIDEO CLIP)    COOPER: As we mentioned earlier, as you might imagine, the Justice Department is pushing back and calls her comment false and reckless.    At issue is Barr's previous sworn testimony last month when he didn't know Robert Mueller's team supported the attorney general's summary of the Russia probe, despite the fact that Mueller did know what Mueller thought because Mueller sent a letter two weeks earlier expressing concern about how the attorney general handled that four-page memo.    In testimony yesterday, Barr was largely seen as evading when trying to explain that issue.    Back now with our guests.    Jeffrey, I mean, it is pretty incredible that the House speaker is accusing the chief law enforcement officer in the nation of a crime.    TOOBIN: It is unusual, but I think Barr's statement is very hard to defend. You know, both Congressman Crist and Senator Van Hollen asked him in pretty direct ways, were you aware that Mueller and his team were upset about how you characterized the Mueller report, and he said, no, he didn't know that they were upset. And, you know, we now know that there were two letters and a phone call which are extremely dramatic events.    Even Barr didn't claim that he forgot about these incidents. He claimed that the questions were not phrased in such a way to call for a answer of ""of course I'm aware."" But, boy, I think he is not going to be prosecuted because the justice department is not going to move against the attorney general, but the question of whether Barr told the truth, I think he's got a tough argument there.    COOPER: Elliot, what is interesting is Barr was saying while the question was imprecise and I didn't know what his staff felt, I had a conversation directly with Mueller, but the letter, which from all intents and purposes was written by Mueller, Barr then went on to say, well, his staff -- somebody on his staff probably wrote the letter. So by that logic, he did hear from the staff if that in fact was his confusion.    WILLIAMS: This is why lawyers put things in writing, so there is no ambiguity as to what was said. The special counsel, and I say the special counsel, not his staff, but the special counsel put out a letter expressing concerns. Now you can pin it on junior staff because you want to disagree with it, but the simple fact is it's in writing.    So, I agree wholeheartedly with Jeffrey's point. Either -- the attorney general has at minimum given inconsistent statements, and obviously at maximum lied under oath to Congress. This all invites the question or the fact that he needs to get up there and clarify it with Congress. You know, and work out some accommodation to his testimony.    You know, there has been this bickering over staff questioning which is actually a quite minor point in congressional oversight matters, get up there and testify, clarify the statements and then we can all move on. We could avoid a lot of this if the Justice Department -- but again, this gets back to what we were talking about in the last segment. It's all part of an attempt to frustrate Congress and not comply with these congressional oversight requests, and we're seeing it playing out here.    COOPER: Kirsten, do you think Speaker Pelosi and congressional Democrats are actually going to act on this?    POWERS: You know, I don't know what they're going to end up doing, but I think they have a very solid case here, and I think that, you know, any way you slice it, he was intentionally trying to mislead. He knew the question that was being asked. And even as you pointed out, even if you take it precisely as it was asked, he lied in response to it because he himself says he believes that the investigators wrote the letter and not Mueller.    So any way you slice it, he wasn't honest. And I think that that should be a bigger problem, frankly, than it is. I hear Republicans defending him, making up this ridiculous story about how he didn't know what they were talking about or he was confused, and it's just not plausible.    COOPER: Robert, do you think he lied? Do you think he wasn't honest?    RAY: I'd like to be fair, civil and clear here, but I think the argument that he lied is overwrought. I don't know why we've reached a point in this country that when someone doesn't like the answer to a question, the first place we run is to perjury and false statements.    [20:25:07] And, you know, look, on this one, would it have been better to have disclosed this? I'm sure with the benefit of hindsight, sure. But I will say on the question of whether it's false statements, lying to Congress or perjury, I really don't think that's the case.    I think one question to me was remember, if the question is, did you know whether or not bob Mueller objected to your summary of the conclusion, remember, a good part of the conclusion is the determination by the attorney general not to bring or to find that there was insufficient evidence of obstruction of justice. I think to this point -- I believe with regard to that question.    I think the attorney general still doesn't know whether or not Bob Mueller agrees with that conclusion.    COOPER: Do you think he was being completely truthful?    RAY: Well, look, I think you also -- Jeffrey selectively edited his response and left out the part, of course, where the attorney general, as he stated in his testimony yesterday, added that he suspected that what the objection was from Mueller's team was about the fact that they wanted a more fulsome disclosure, which is the only material fact that would be an issue here that would form the basis of lying to Congress because it would have to be material and also any argument that it was perjury.    So, I understand -- I understand --    COOPER: But would you characterize his testimony as fully clear, fully transparent?    RAY: Well, that isn't what y'all started with. You started with Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the United States House of Representatives --    COOPER: I'm asking you now, though.    RAY: -- saying that the attorney general of the United States was lying to Congress. The answer is no.    COOPER: But I've asked three times, do you think he was fully transparent? You haven't said yes. RAY: I would say that your oath is to tell the truth, the whole truth    and nothing but the truth. I think it would have been advisable and better had he disclosed the fact that he had a communication with the special counsel.    WILLIAMS: Anderson, if I may?    RAY: But, Anderson, that's not the same thing as saying --    COOPER: I understand, I understand.    RAY: -- that he was lying to Congress or he was misleading under the false statement statutes or that it was perjury. We've got stop that.    COOPER: Jeff, I want you to be able to respond, and then we've got to go.    TOOBIN: Well, I'm not sure. I didn't say it was a crime. You know, that's sort of an irrelevant issue. There is not going to be a prosecution here.    What I'm just saying is this was not honest testimony. If he had told the truth, it would have been a huge bombshell. It would have been enormous news that Mueller had objected.    That's why the only reason it seems to me he didn't tell the truth, because he wanted to avoid that disclosure, and that's why I think it's so unfortunate, and really bad that he didn't tell the truth in answer to those two questions earlier.    COOPER: OK. I got to --    RAY: I just don't happen to agree.    COOPER: I hear you. Thanks to everybody.    Jeff, tell that guy behind you who just teed off he should have used a 5 iron instead of a 3 iron. I don't know what a 5 iron or a 3 iron is. I don't play golf. I just decided to say that.    More on our breaking news ahead, yes, and maybe tell me one day what that actually means.    Plus, we'll talk to a congressman on the Judiciary Committee who says Barr is one of the most dangerous men in Washington, next.    (COMMERCIAL BREAK)    [20:31:53] ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: We're following breaking news tonight. President Trump is saying he likely can't let former White House Counsel Don McGahn testify before the House Judiciary Committee as part of its obstruction of justice investigation.    Also House speaker, as we mentioned, Nancy Pelosi said Attorney General Barr committed a crime. She says he lied to Congress. The Justice Department calls that false. Congressman Ted Lieu, a member of the House Judiciary Committee has his own opinion on that matter. I spoke to him earlier.    (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)    COOPER: Congressman Lieu, first of all, Speaker Pelosi saying that Attorney General Barr lied to Congress and that's a crime. Do you agree with her?    REP. TED LIEU (D-CA): I do. I'm a former prosecutor, and it looks just like perjury. Basically, Barr was asked if Special Counsel Mueller's team had any concerns about his summary of the Mueller report, and he said no. And we know that that's a lie, because he got a letter from Bob Mueller saying essentially that he mischaracterized the Mueller report.    COOPER: Yes. So to the Justice Department's argument about why Barr wouldn't show up today, why couldn't judiciary committee members who are attorneys like yourself question Barr today instead of insisting on staff attorneys? What is the rationale for what because that is the thing that he used as a reason not to come?    LIEU: I think if we didn't have that reason, he would have picked another reason not to come. He actually didn't tell the Judiciary Committee until after his Senate hearing yesterday, which tells me that he realized it did not go well.    And certainly, we could have just members ask questions or we could ask staff counsel, but it's up to Congress to decide how we run our hearing, and this is nothing unusual. Last term I was in numerous judicial committee meetings where staff counsel questioned members of the Trump administration.    COOPER: What do you think of the likelihood of getting Barr to actually come in front of the committee is at this point?    LIEU: So Congress has the power to issue subpoenas. And if he is simply not going to show up in the Judiciary Committee, we will at some point issue a subpoena, and then we can enforce it.    He has right now violated a current subpoena for the unredacted Mueller report. That we're going to enforce next week with a contempt proceeding if he does not provide the full Mueller report in the next couple days.    COOPER: And a contempt proceeding, so if he is held in contempt of Congress, what -- does that really result in anything?    LIEU: Yes, it does. So here's the process. The House Judiciary Committee will vote in a contempt proceeding. If we hold him in contempt, it goes to the House floor. If the House floor votes in contempt, then it triggers two things.    First, it allows our House counsel to litigate in courts to try to enforce it. Second, the courts have already upheld Congress' inherent power to start taking actions against that individual without the courts. So we have procedures where we could in fact start levying fines on that person. In the past, they've even had a House jail. I don't think we're going go there, but at least we do have that power and the courts have upheld it.    COOPER: You've called the attorney general now one of the most dangerous men in Washington, which is -- I mean, is an extraordinary statement about any federal official, let alone the chief law enforcement officer in this country.    [20:35:06] LIEU: Two reasons I said that. One is not only did he mislead the American people, he was then given a letter from Robert Mueller saying he misled the American people, and he doubles down and lies to Congress and the American people after that. And second, right now he is suing to eliminate preexisting conditions to health care coverage for millions of Americans. He is a dangerous man.    COOPER: It does seem hard to believe when the attorney general yesterday, you know, said that the note was a little snippy and that it was probably just written by a staff member, the idea -- I mean, it's an extraordinary step for Mueller to have written this letter and sent it to Barr, and now it's public. The idea that he would have pawned that off on a staff member and not even looked at it or agreed with everything that's in it seems ludicrous on its face.    LIEU: Absolutely. It was definitely a snitty thing for Bill Barr to say and there's no way that a staff member wrote that. That was an extraordinary act. I'm sure Robert Mueller wrote that letter, and we hope Robert Mueller is going to come and we expect him to come later this month to testify before the House Judiciary Committee.    COOPER: Congressman Ted Lieu, I appreciate your time. Thank you.    LIEU: Thank you, Anderson.    (END VIDEOTAPE)    COOPER: There's a lot going on tonight. We have more breaking news. ""The New York Times"" is reporting the name of a government investigator who posed as a research assistant during the Trump campaign. Part of the FBI's counter intelligence efforts to better understand the campaign's links to Russia, in particular George Papadopoulos. That's who the focus of this investigator was. We'll have details on that next.    (COMMERCIAL BREAK)    [20:40:14] COOPER: ""The New York Times"" is reporting previously unknown details about the FBI's counterintelligence probe into the Trump campaign and its links to Russia, specifically, information about a woman who posed as a research assistant in order to meet with former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos. Sharing the byline is ""New York Times"" reporter Adam Goldman.    Adam, if you can, just walk us through this new details about what steps the FBI took to investigate George Papadopoulos. ADAM GOLDMAN, REPORTER, NEW YORK TIMES: Well, what we've learned is after Mr. Papadopoulos got this offer of cooperation from the Russians, in a sense, the FBI set about trying to figure out what he knew, and they wanted to do it secretly.    So they arranged a meeting in London with an informant, a professor named Stefan Halper, and a woman named Azra Turk, who was a government investigator that the FBI had sent to London to work with the informant.    And together they worked George to figure out what he might know or might not know. And they met with him separately and together and ultimately the operation in London in which the British knew about was not a success.    COOPER: And is it clear why the decision was made by the FBI to send this particular investigator to London?    GOLDMAN: This person would play the role of Stefan Halper's research assistant. And I thought the FBI believed she would make a good fit. I think part of the rationale was also to have an American investigator there who could provide some oversight and make sure this operation stayed on the rails.    COOPER: Was she an FBI agent?    GOLDMAN: I'm just going to leave it right now as a government investigator.    COOPER: OK.    GOLDMAN: I use that wording for a reason, and I'm going to leave it at that.    COOPER: OK. Is it -- and is it clear if any actual information was learned from that meeting? I mean, you said it was basically a failure.    GOLDMAN: Yes, it was -- basically it wasn't fruitful but, you know, what it showed was this, you know, some might say panic, others might say heightened sense of alarm about what was going on, and they needed to get to the bottom of it.    I mean, this was pretty extraordinary for the FBI to move this fast on something overseas, to run this type of operation. And it really goes to the seriousness of the threat, at least the threat they received.    COOPER: And yesterday Attorney General Barr defended -- he's used the term spying. How does that square with the fact that the FBI Russia investigation is now under investigation by the Justice Department?    GOLDMAN: You know, Attorney General Barr thinks this is a good English word. You know, obviously there was some in the law enforcement community who would object to the term ""spying."" They would prefer to say lawful surveillance. I mean either way, the FBI was running an informant and using another investigator to covertly or clandestinely, you know, acquire information.    COOPER: And the President's reelection campaign, as you know, is already arguing that this proves they were the victims of some corrupt probe. That's really not what you're reporting is?    GOLDMAN: No, no. That's not the point we were trying to make. Look, we as an organization, ""The New York Times,"" we've done some Seminole reporting on the origins of the investigation, how it started. And this is just a continuation of that reporting.    I think, you know, right now the only thing we know is this was a lawful law enforcement operation that took place in London with the knowledge of British intelligence. You know, unless that changes, you know, we're still working from the premise that this was lawful, and the FBI didn't, in fact -- it wasn't nefarious.    So, we'll -- you know, we've got see where this takes us. You know, Barr might come to a different conclusion down the road, but at this moment, nobody is providing any evidence that the FBI actually committed wrongdoing. They were simply being aggressive when it came to what they say is a lawful and predicated investigation, though an extraordinary one.    COOPER: Yes. Adam Goldman, thank you so much. Great reporting, appreciate it.    GOLDMAN: Thanks.    COOPER: Attorney General Barr's personal and professional relationship with Robert Mueller stretches back at least three decades, but has the letter from Mueller that Barr calls snitty changed the equation? That's next.    (COMMERCIAL BREAK)    [20:48:16] COOPER: The House Judiciary Committee says it would like Mueller to testify on May 15th about his nearly two-year-long investigation. Now, as monumental as that might be, there is no indication to date whether that testimony will in fact happen on that date, or at all.    For his part, Attorney General Barr made it clear yesterday he wasn't the least bit happy with the letter his long-time friend sent him about Barr's framing of the report.    (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)    WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: You know, the letter was a bit snitty and I think it was probably written by one of the staff people.    (END VIDEO CLIP)    COOPER: Well, whether or not that's accurate, the entirety of Barr's testimony as we've reported has come under attack, withering attack by Democrats in Congress and should Mueller one day publicly refute what Barr has said under oath, there would certainly be questions about what that might mean for the -- certainly the very least the old friendship between them.    Perspective now from Mueller biographer, Garrett Graff, author of ""The Threat Matrix: The FBI at War in the Age of Global Terror."" Garrett, I mean, you've read, I think you said the other night, pretty much everything Mueller has ever written or ever said. The idea that Barr is throwing out that this was probably written by some staffer, that -- I mean, does that seem possible at all to you?    GARRETT GRAFF, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I mean, it certainly probably technically true in that this was a document that was likely drafted by the staff, debated among the staff.    But, you know, the idea that Mueller didn't carefully go over every line of it that the staff probably debated with Mueller the exact wording, the exact phrasing, and I would actually guess the staff pushed for harsher wording than Mueller was actually comfortable with.    COOPER: The tension that appears to be playing out between these two people, between Barr and Mueller, is it surprising? I mean, you know, in his testimony, in his confirmation testimony, Barr said, you know, they'd been friends. They'll be friends after this. Do you think that's true?    [20:50:03] GRAFF: It's possible. The friendship to my understanding has always been strongest actually on the wives side, that Bill Barr's wife and Robert Mueller's wife spent time together in a bible study among other settings.    But, you know, remember -- you have to remember, and this has been I think part of what's been hard for the American people to understand in a lot of this, these elite circles of the Department of Justice are just incredibly small.    I mean, when you look back over the last 25 years, you've had the same relatively small set of people. Robert Mueller, Jim Comey, Bill Barr, Eric Holder, you know, rotate through these top jobs, Christopher Wray. And so these are very tight professional circles with the people who do have a deep professional respect for one another.    COOPER: What is their disagreement over the way the findings of the Mueller report were characterized say about how they see their roles as prosecutors and how they interpret the law?    GRAFF: Yes. And I think that this was where we're beginning to see a real split between Bob Mueller's personality and Bill Barr's personality. Mueller first and foremost is a Justice Department institutionalist. You know, he is not a political figure. He is not a partisan person. Whereas, Bill Barr has been a lawyer in the Department of Justice certainly for -- you know, repeatedly, but has always been more of a partisan figure than Mueller ever has.    And, you know, when you go back and you look at the Manuel Noriega prosecution, when you look at Iran-contra, when you look at, you know, Barr going out of his way to write that 19-page unsolicited memo for the Raskin's about the obstruction of justice case that Mueller was building, you know, these are just actions that you could never imagine Mueller himself actually doing. Barr has proven that he is a partisan figure more than he is a Justice Department figure.    COOPER: Do you think Mueller would want to testify?    GRAFF: I think that Mueller has never enjoyed congressional testimony in any job that he has ever had, but he will certainly -- he will certainly comply with any lawful order that he receives to testify.    COOPER: And the Office of the House Judiciary Committee, I mean, they fully intend to call him. It remains to be seen if and when that happens, if the DOJ tries to prevent him from speaking. Would it be feasible -- I mean Mueller is still under -- he still works at the Department of Justice, doesn't he?    GRAFF: He does until he decides that he doesn't. And presumably at some point in the forthcoming days, Mueller will decide his work as special counsel is wrapped up and he'll turn in his resignation and he'll go back to his golf game.    COOPER: Garrett Graff, appreciate it. Thanks very much. I want to check in with Chris to see what he's working on for ""Cuomo Prime Time."" Chris?    CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: I wonder what it means that he hasn't done that yet?    COOPER: Yes, it's interesting.    CUOMO: You know, I wonder why he's there, what he wants, what he thinks is important. That's going to be a big step. Now, paralleling and shadowing what he does is going to be what the Democrats do, right?    So we have Senator Amy Klobuchar on tonight. Obviously she is running for president, a senator who got to question Bill Barr yesterday. What does she think the Democrats should do next? Speaker Pelosi, obviously that's in the House, but heavy hit at A.G. Barr saying that he committed perjury.    COOPER: Yes.    CUOMO: What are they going to do about it?    COOPER: Yes.    CUOMO: That little stunt at the House today, what are they going to actually do? So we're going to go through that. And we're going to start looking at what was done to surveil the campaign. Will any of it wind up being called spying?    COOPER: Yes, definitely from the campaign is saying it is. Chris, I'll see you in about seven minutes from now.    President Trump said he would hire all of the best people. Remember that? Well, another one of those best people implodes or in Washington speaks removes himself from consideration. ""The Ridiculist"" is next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)    [20:56:19] COOPER: Time now for ""The Ridiculist"". And tonight it's another bleak milestone in the White House office of the best and brightest.    President Trump's intended nominee for the Federal Reserve Board, conservative pundit and self-distracting mansplainer, Stephen Moore, today withdrew his name from consideration, which is a Washington euphemism for his Senate confirmation was as likely as Sarah Sanders passing a polygraph test, or Sarah Sanders admitting she was wrong, or Sarah Sanders showing up for press briefing, it's still his choice.    Moore who full disclosure was formally a CNN Contributor and, yes, I know, slow clap for us on that one, today sent the President a letter that reads in part, ""The unrelenting attacks on my character have become untenable for me and my family and three more months of this would be too hard on us.""    In hindsight, probably wasn't a good sign to Senator Lindsey Graham, a White House ally who'd probably be willing to drive the get away golf cart after President Trump shot someone on Fifth Avenue said the other day that Moore's nomination would be ""problematic.""    Now, before you take out your clarinet to play a funeral (INAUDIBLE) for Stephen Moore's career prospects, consider that what he claims are attacks on his character are actual examples of reporters reading his past writings.    CNN's KFile recently uncovered articles that Moore wrote as an adult that were littered with sexism and degrading references to women. Moore said he was joking, but these weren't like high school mistakes, these weren't college year book idiocy. He was a full-grown adult writing in major magazines. You can go to cnn.com and hold your nose if you want to read the details.    For his part, the President tweeted today in part, ""Steve Moore, a great pro-growth economist and a truly fine person, has decided to withdraw from the Fed process."" Truly fine person, doesn't that kind of ring a bell? Oh, yes, Moore is a member of a very, very elite club, one of the very best the President promised he would hire.    (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)    DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going to make America great again. We're going to use our best people.    I'm going to get the best people.    We're going to deliver. We're going to get the best people in the world.    We don't want people that are B level, C level, D level. We have to get our absolute best.    We're going to use our smartest and our best. We're not using political hacks anymore.    It's a sophisticated chess match, but I have the best people lined up.    You need people that are truly, truly capable.    We have to get the best people.    (END VIDEO CLIP)    COOPER: That's true. Yes, the best people, sophisticated chess match. It seems like the President was missing a rook or two when he held the job fair because it's not just Stephen Moore, there's the President's other Fed favorite, ex-pizza kingpin and failed presidential candidate Herman Cain whose past sexual harassment allegations doomed his chances pretty much from the get go.    There was HHS Secretary Tom Price, loved private jets as much as he loved taxpayers funding them. There was also the Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, remember him, who apparently thought he was Queen Elizabeth because he ordered a special flag to be raised whenever he entered the building. Yes, smooth-skinned EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, he used his government security detail to seek out his preferred brand of lotion from the Ritz-Carlton.    The list goes on. Man, can you image being on that security detail? Mr. Pruitt wants some lotion from the concierge desk. That would be kind of demoralizing, I would think. Rob Porter accused of abuse. Michael Flynn lied to the FBI, but he was a good guy. Sean Spicer, cartoonish disaster and a liar verified in the Mueller report. Oh, Scaramucci. I mean, look, how much time have we got because we could go on?    The irony is as thick as swamp water. The President and his allies fuel conspiracy theories about career government workers, you know, people who have dedicated entire careers working behind the scenes, not talking about it on T.V., not being pundits, actual people who become actual experts in their sometimes very obscure but important fields working for the government, those people are hacks.    According to the President and Alex Jones, they're deep state, which is why it's a good thing there are so many jobs in various agencies that have gone unfilled. Don't worry about it. Sleep well at night knowing only the best and brightest are at work in the White House and on ""The Ridiculist"".    Well, the news continues. I want to hand it over to Chris for ""Cuomo Prime Time."" Chris?    CUOMO: Very serious show, but I have to do it. Name the movie, ""It puts the lotion in the basket.""    COOPER: Oh, come on, ""Silence of the Lambs.""    CUOMO: There it is my man, my man. All right, Anderson, thank you very much. I'm Chris Cuomo. Welcome to ""Prime Time.""",Transcripts,true,280798488345158329065130657809075577898
,"Volcano Watch is a weekly article and activity update written by U.S. Geological Survey Hawaiian Volcano Observatory scientists and affiliates.  Sources/Usage: Public Domain. La Palma is a basaltic shield volcano in the Canary Islands. Like Hawaiian volcanoes, La Palma typically erupts lava flows. This aerial photo, courtesy of Radio Televisión Canaria, shows lava flows that are being generated by a fissure eruption upslope on La Palma. One of the lava flows is entering the ocean, creating new land called a lava delta. Lava deltas are built by the accumulation of lava near the base of the sea cliff at an ocean entry.  “Volcano Watchers” are probably aware that an eruption began on La Palma in the Canary Islands on September 19. The eruption style is similar to Hawaiian eruptions, and both locations share the potential for flank collapse and tsunami.  Basaltic ocean islands, such as the Island of Hawai‘i and the Canary Islands, tend to experience catastrophic landslides every few hundred thousand years—a discovery first made by USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory Scientist-in-Charge Jim Moore in the early 1960s! A significant portion of an island is removed during collapse and has the potential to displace tremendous amounts of seawater, generating local tsunami waves that are thought to be over 100 meters (300 feet) high. From this understanding grew a notion that collapsing volcanoes—particularly in the Canary Islands—could generate ocean-wide “mega-tsunami.”  In 2001, an academic paper suggested that collapse of La Palma could result in tsunami waves up to 25 m (about 80 feet) high along the east coasts of North and South America. This scenario made headlines in the media, which inaccurately depicted a huge wave devastating New York City.  But can collapses actually generate these “mega-tsunami” far from their sources? Subsequent research casts doubt on this idea.  The Canary Islands “mega-tsunami” scenario assumed a single, coherent, massive collapse block that reached a high velocity very quickly. Ocean floor mapping surrounding the Canary Islands, however, indicates that collapses instead occur in incremental or piecemeal fashion. In addition, geomorphologists found, via slope stability analysis, that the potential collapse volume is much smaller than was simulated by the 2001 paper.  Tsunami modeling has also advanced considerably since 2001. Studies of landslide-induced waves show that they travel at different speeds and interact more across long distances, leading to smaller wave height far from their sources. Better knowledge of ocean bathymetry, island and coastal topography, and the transfer of energy between slide blocks and water also contributed to more accurate modeling.  These new simulations suggest that the maximum wave height along the east coast of the Americas from a “worst-case scenario” collapse of La Palma would be on the order of 1-2 m (3-7 feet)—still hazardous, but similar to common storm surge.  A lack of geologic evidence also calls the “mega-tsunami” hypothesis into question. Tsunami leave characteristic sediment deposits on the coastlines they impact. But no such deposit has ever been identified on the east coasts of North and South America.  Collapses of Canary Island volcanoes are rare, occurring on timescales of hundreds of thousands of years, and should be preceded by signs of flank instability: increases in earthquakes and ground surface deformation. Canary Island volcanoes also erupt regularly—La Palma last erupted in 1971 and 1949—and slope stability analyses conducted at La Palma indicate that the structure is stable. The volcano would have to grow significantly before a collapse was likely.  This abundant evidence refutes the “mega-tsunami” hypothesis, demonstrating that it does not hold up to rigorous examination. However, tsunami that are generated by volcanoes are a real process and a significant threat. For example, the 1883 explosive eruption of Krakatau, in Indonesia, caused a local tsunami that killed tens of thousands on nearby coastlines. In 2018, a smaller eruption and collapse of Anak Krakatau, an island which grew in the 1883 caldera, also resulted in a local tsunami that killed hundreds.  Local tsunami can also be generated by other volcanic processes. On the Island of Hawai‘i, lava delta collapse at lava-ocean entries can cause small tsunami that impact areas adjacent to the delta. Slip on the fault underlying Kīlauea’s south flank, associated with M7–8 earthquakes, caused local tsunami in 1868 and 1975 that took lives. These are processes that have happened repeatedly in human history; they will happen again, and their associated hazards deserve our attention.  While the scientific view of the “mega-tsunami” hypothesis has evolved in the years since 2001, that original work led others to start investigations that contributed new knowledge that advanced our understanding of landslides and tsunami generated by volcanoes. In this way, the story is a marvelous example of exactly how science happens!  Volcano Activity Updates  Kīlauea volcano is erupting. Its USGS Volcano Alert level is at WATCH (https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/volcano-hazards/about-alert-levels). Kīlauea updates are issued daily.  Lava continues to erupt from a single vent in the western wall of Halemaʻumaʻu crater. All lava activity is confined within Halemaʻumaʻu crater in Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park. Sulfur dioxide emission rates remain high and were estimated at around 2,700 tonnes per day on Oct. 17, 2021. Seismicity is elevated but stable, with few earthquakes and ongoing volcanic tremor. Summit tiltmeters have remained relatively flat over the past week. For more information on the current eruption of Kīlauea, see Recent Eruption (usgs.gov).  Mauna Loa is not erupting and remains at Volcano Alert Level ADVISORY. This alert level does not mean that an eruption is imminent or that progression to an eruption from the current level of unrest is certain. Mauna Loa updates are issued weekly.  This past week, about 114 small-magnitude earthquakes were recorded below the summit and upper elevation flanks of Mauna Loa—the majority of these occurred at shallow depths less than 10 kilometers (6 miles). Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements show no major deformation over the past week. Gas concentrations and fumarole temperatures at both the summit and at Sulphur Cone on the Southwest Rift Zone remain stable. Webcams show no changes to the landscape. For more information on current monitoring of Mauna Loa, see: https://www.usgs.gov/volcanoes/mauna-loa/monitoring.  There were 9 events with 3 or more felt reports in the Hawaiian Islands during the past week.

,"Amish buggies are parked at a home along the New Holland Road south of New Holland for a wedding celebration on March 17, 2020. The administrator of a medical center in the heart of the Amish community in New Holland Borough estimates as many as 90% of Plain families have since had at least one family member infected with COVID-19, and that this religious enclave achieved what no other community in the United States has: herd immunity. (Suzette Wenger/LNP/LancasterOnline via AP)  Amish buggies are parked at a home along the New Holland Road south of New Holland for a wedding celebration on March 17, 2020. The administrator of a medical center in the heart of the Amish community in New Holland Borough estimates as many as 90% of Plain families have since had at least one family member infected with COVID-19, and that this religious enclave achieved what no other community in the United States has: herd immunity. (Suzette Wenger/LNP/LancasterOnline via AP)  LANCASTER, Pa. (AP) —  Late last spring a COVID-19 wave tore through the Plain community when they resumed church services, infecting an untold number of Amish and Mennonites in Lancaster County.  The administrator of a medical center in the heart of the Amish community in New Holland Borough estimates as many as 90% of Plain families have since had at least one family member infected, and that this religious enclave achieved what no other community in the United States has: herd immunity.  “So, you would think if COVID was as contagious as they say, it would go through like a tsunami; and it did,” said Allen Hoover, an Old Order Mennonite and administrator of the Parochial Medical Center, a clinic that primarily serves the Plain community.  ADVERTISEMENT  Public health officials and epidemiologists did not dispute the widespread outbreak Hoover described. But they voiced concern that a misplaced perception of herd immunity in a population that makes up 8% of Lancaster County may compromise the effort to turn the tide on the pandemic.  As Hoover observed, faith in herd immunity has prompted members of the Plain community to relax on key mitigation efforts such as masking and social distancing, and they may see little reason to be vaccinated.  Additionally, it is unknown whether achieving herd immunity last year would be beneficial now.  Six infectious disease experts with whom LNP ′ LancasterOnline spoke expressed unease with a reliance on the notion the Plain community had achieved herd immunity here. And they pointed out that if not the case, past infections and existing antibodies may provide limited protection.  “Herd immunity is only true at a given point in time,” said Eric Lofgren, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Washington State University. “It’s not a switch that once it gets thrown, you’re good. It’ll wear off.”  This collision of science and personal experience could leave Lancaster County vulnerable just as county health officials seek to make progress vaccinating residents against COVID-19.  “You can have a long period where you think everything is OK, but you have this whole population that’s susceptible,” said David Lo, professor of biomedical sciences and senior associate dean of research at the University of California, Riverside.  Lo added, “All it takes is one person who’s contagious to give you this sudden outbreak.”  ‘There’s a real risk of having an outbreak’  Hoover agreed with these epidemiologists.  ADVERTISEMENT  He acknowledged that face masks and social distancing have been critical for mitigating the spread of COVID-19; he wears a face covering when interacting with non-Amish. But he also knows many in the Plain community don’t take the same precautions.  “As a general rule, we want to respect those around us,” said Hoover, who has been the medical center’s administrator since 2004. But because of perceived immunity, Hoover said, the Plain community believes public health directives don’t “apply to us.”  It’s a perspective Hoover understands, but doesn’t share.  “We should be careful that we’re not the cause of it spreading,” Hoover said.  The Parochial Medical Center is not the only medical provider that caters to the Plain community, but with 33,000 active patients, it is arguably the largest.  The Plain community in Lancaster County, which includes both Amish and Mennonites, is not insignificant. Combined, it represents nearly 8% of the county’s population of just more than 545,000 residents, according to estimates from Elizabethtown College’s Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies.  The dearth of COVID-19 testing among the Plain doesn’t just mean a lack of scientific certainty.  “The reason it’s important is because it’s unlikely that 100% have had the disease,” said David Dowdy, a professor in the epidemiology department at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  Under the right conditions, a single infected individual can trigger an outbreak.  Take what happened at Disneyland.  Two decades ago, measles was declared eradicated in the United States because of an effective national vaccination campaign. But that didn’t stop an outbreak from infecting 150 people in seven states, Mexico and Canada in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The outbreak was attributed to unvaccinated children.  The implication is this: If an outbreak of a highly contagious disease for which there is a proven vaccine could happen at the Happiest Place on Earth, it can happen in Lancaster County.  An outbreak among the Plain would impact the wider community because while these religious sects are insular, they are not isolated. The Plain mingle with the English, as they refer to their non-Amish neighbors, at grocery stores, their places of business and other public places.  “There could easily still be pockets of the (Plain) community who have not been infected, and if they’re infected, there’s a real risk of having an outbreak,” Dowdy said.  ‘It was bad here in the spring’  The Plain community followed the example of its English neighbors and shuttered schoolhouses and canceled biweekly church services when the novel coronavirus threatened to overwhelm Pennsylvania’s health-care system last spring.  Initially, compliance with public health directives was about not being offensive to non-Amish neighbors, Hoover said.  But as the pandemic wore on, messages from skeptical lawmakers and English neighbors suggested that the virus wasn’t a big concern.  For example, back in early May, a number of Lancaster County elected officials — including state Sen. Ryan Aument, a Mount Joy Republican — said they would join a handful of other counties to defy Gov. Tom Wolf’s stay-at-home orders to save the local economy, which had been battered in the shutdown.  County Commissioner Josh Parsons, a Republican, challenged the legal basis for requiring face masks. And state Rep. David Zimmerman, a Republican who represents a large swath of eastern Lancaster County, home to a large number of Plain, criticized the governor’s handling of the pandemic.  “The Amish are a distinct group, but they also respond, in many ways, like many rural Lancastrians,” said Steve Nolt, interim director of the Young Center. “I think there was a lot of non-Amish influence on the Amish.”  As their English neighbors resumed pre-pandemic activities, the Plain community did as well, Nolt and others said.  By late April, when Pennsylvania was still under stay-at-home orders, the Plain community had resumed worship services, where they shared communion cups and holy kisses, a church greeting among believers.  Infections quickly followed.  “It was bad here in the spring; one patient right after another,” said Pam Cooper, a physician’s assistant at the Parochial Medical Center.  Just how deep into the community the infections spread is impossible to know. Hoover speculated that among those displaying symptoms, fewer than 10% consented to be tested.  In late April and early May, when Hoover said the virus ran unimpeded through the Plain community, the county’s positivity rate — the percent of positive tests — exceeded 20%, its highest of the pandemic, according to Covid Act Now, a nonprofit that provides local disease data. (Last year, the World Health Organization recommended governments use a rate of 5% or lower for two weeks as the threshold for reopening.)  If Hoover’s assessment is accurate, and if more Plain patients had been tested, the positivity rate could very well have been higher.  While so few were tested, many exhibited all the symptoms that have become so emblematic of the disease.  Cooper estimated the medical center saw — on average — nearly a dozen infections a day, or roughly 15% of the patients it serves daily.  The disease, as has been true in the wider community, knew no boundaries. Hoover became infected in November; at least one of his children was infected twice.  “It really went through pretty quick, in a few weeks,” Cooper said.  The number of patients ebbed in the summer before picking up again in the fall, although not at nearly the rate as was seen in the spring.  Cases now are rare. Hoover said Tuesday that the center hasn’t had a patient present with COVID-19 symptoms in roughly six weeks.  ‘You’d actually have to test the herd’  Epidemiologists from the University of Pittsburgh, Washington State, Johns Hopkins, Emory and the University of California all said a widespread outbreak leading to herd immunity in the Plain community would be rare, but possible.  “It’s extremely unusual,” Lofgren, at Washington State University, said of herd immunity to COVID-19. “It would be the first general population in the United States that’s done it.”  Significant outbreaks have been identified elsewhere.  The CDC, for example, studied COVID-19 outbreaks among smaller Amish communities in rural Ohio and Indiana.  As the CDC has noted, the Amish emphasis on strong social bonds and religious gatherings posed a unique public health challenge during the pandemic.  Unlike the outbreak Hoover described in Lancaster County, however, the Ohio and Indiana communities conducted testing.  “They really contributed to a lot of spread of COVID in the community,” said Shirley Bixby, director of nursing for the Ashland County Board of Health in northeastern Ohio. “It was quite nerve-wracking.”  In Indiana, COVID-19 infections were so common among the Amish that residents believe most had been exposed.  At the height of the summer outbreak, seven out of 10 COVID-19 tests came back positive, said Dr. Daniel N. Kragt, a physician at Dayspring Christian Health Care in Middlebury, Indiana.  Dayspring is a cash-only provider in the middle of the Amish community, about 35 miles east of South Bend.  For all the tests Kragt conducted, about 40% of Amish patients declined.  Making scientific conclusions about immunity is difficult, Kragt noted, because very often “the herd doesn’t want” to be tested.  “To say you have herd immunity, you’d actually have to test the herd,” Kragt said.  ‘Plenty’ of death certificates  COVID-19 has been devastating to Pennsylvania seniors, with nine out of every 10 fatalities among those 60 and older. In Lancaster County, 96% of COVID-19 fatalities as of March 17 — 926 of 968 — have been people age 60 or older.  The same appears to be true for the elderly in the Plain community, as Hoover estimated most deaths were 70 and older.  Cooper said she signed “plenty” of death certificates during that time.  But the death toll may never be known.  Lancaster County Coroner Dr. Stephen Diamantoni identified fewer than a dozen deaths in the Plain community, an estimate he derived at by using decedent location and last name.  Virus-related deaths, Cooper speculated, were likely listed as pneumonia.  Diamantoni does not dispute this.  “People have to die from something,” Diamantoni said. “If they don’t want any intervention done, these people could slip under the radar.”  Even if more virus testing had been done, it’s unlikely the public would know much more about the disease’s impact. That’s because demographic information collected by health departments — such as race and ethnicity — does not include religion.  The fatalities have not gone unnoticed.  A contributor to The Diary, a monthly newspaper published in Kirkwood with Amish reports on crops, births, deaths, weddings and ordinations across the United States, tallied the annual number of obituaries since 2015.  “As you can see, the number of deaths this year is 100 count higher than any of the five previous years,” Joas D. Troyer, of Hestand, Kentucky, wrote in January’s edition. “This may give us a good idea how many people died from coronavirus.”  No ‘magic number’  Herd immunity — either through infection or vaccination — has been touted as the way back to normal.  “The only true herd immunity that we can bring as a community is for people to be vaccinated,” said Alice Yoder, executive director of Community Health at Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health.  Because immunologists don’t yet know what the threshold is for COVID-19 immunity, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, has said the coronavirus could require vaccination rates as high as 90%.  “The key is that there is not necessarily a magic number,” said Dowdy, at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  The lack of infection data on the notoriously private Plain community makes proving or disproving whether Anabaptists (a Christian community of which Amish and Mennonites are a part) achieved herd immunity impossible 11 months later. Testing could be conducted now, but the absence of antibodies — Dowdy and other experts said — doesn’t mean the lack of infection.  As the United States races to stay ahead of virus mutations, the more pressing issue — these experts said — was vaccine hesitancy. As of March 16, there were two other mutations in Pennsylvania: 68 cases of the UK variant and one South African case, according to the CDC.  “The higher the vaccination in the (Plain) community, the better it will be for the entire community,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases physician and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.  Despite lower childhood vaccination rates among the Amish, there is no religious prohibition, said Nolt, at Elizabethtown College, who has written 14 books about the Amish.  In a 2017 doctoral study that examined Amish perceptions in Lancaster County, Cooper found the majority had a positive attitude toward immunizations and roughly six in 10 surveyed were likely to vaccinate their children.  As Cooper noted in her study, three out four of those she surveyed said they had never discussed vaccination with their health care provider.  “Providers are missing many opportunities to discuss vaccines with Amish parents,” wrote Cooper, at the Parochial Medical Center.  ‘God helps those who help themselves’  Vaccine efforts among the Plain community could prove challenging.  “I think it will be a very hard sell,” Hoover said.  The Amish have been persuaded to embrace mass vaccination efforts before, most notably after a polio outbreak in 1979 and a rash of measles in 1991. This has left health officials hopeful the Anabaptists will respond again.  The Pennsylvania Amish Safety Committee and other partnerships will be crucial to outreach efforts that have already begun. Comprised of five elected Old Order Amish men, the committee provides safety information and has helped spearhead issues such as the 2011 effort to cover holes in haylofts after emergency room doctors encountered a number of Plain sect children who had fallen through.  The goal, Lancaster General’s Yoder said, is to achieve a vaccination rate protective of the entire community.  “Of course,” Yoder said, “there might be some concern that we don’t reach that.”  The way Dr. Holmes Morton sees it, these religious sects must take responsibility for getting vaccinated to protect their Lancaster County neighbors.  “I just think the Plain community has to get involved in a public-health sense,” said Morton, founder of the Central Pennsylvania Clinic in Belleville, Mifflin County.  Morton, who first created the Clinic for Special Children in Strasburg, is renowned for his pioneering work on genetic diseases among Plain children.  “Just because you’re Plain doesn’t mean you’re exempt,” Morton said. “God helps those who help themselves.”  Sidebar:  Plain community population  The Plain community includes Amish and Old Order Mennonites.  With a population of 40,525 people, the Lancaster Amish settlement is the largest in the United States and extends into Chester County and northern Maryland.  Roughly 88%, or more than 35,000 adults and children in this settlement, live within the borders of Lancaster County.  Old Order Mennonites primarily consist of three groups — the Groffdale Mennonite Conference, the Stauffer Mennonite Church and Reidenbach Mennonites — with a combined population of about 5,700.  Together, these religious sects represent nearly 8% of the 545,000 people living in Lancaster County.  Source: Elizabethtown College Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies, U.S. Census Bureau  Sidebar:  What is herd immunity?  Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient number of people have immunity to a disease to prevent a virus from finding new hosts, thereby protecting the wider population. Immunity can be achieved either through recovering from an infection or vaccination.  So, why is it important?  Herd immunity is the only way to eradicate COVID-19.  The more transmissible a disease, the higher the percentage of a population needs to be immune. Initially, scientists estimated 60% to 70% of the population needed to acquire resistance to provide herd immunity.  It’s difficult to know the precise threshold for the novel coronavirus.  Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, late last year began moving the goal post, adjusting that estimate up to as high as 90%.  The reasons?  Viruses constantly mutate and COVID-19 is becoming more transmissible.  Because the elderly and other individuals with compromised immune systems cannot risk a COVID-19 infection, herd immunity will be crucial to protecting these groups.  ___  Online:  https://bit.ly/313ygjX",90 percent of Plain community households hit by COVID-19,true,138440276076835747782800561438517803392

On June 8, voters will have the opportunity to judge her on her record. We all know that Sturgeon’s only priority is a second independence referendum. Every single SNP MP elected has that same priority – they will go to ­Westminster to campaign for ­independence, not to stand up for Scotland. (Image: 2017 Getty Images) And while Sturgeon and her MPs take their eye off the ball, the public services the SNP are in charge of here in Scotland are neglected. Here’s the truth behind the SNP spin. NHS Scotland’s health boards could face a £1billion cuts ­bombshell under the SNP Government and local services across Scotland are under threat. As health secretary, Sturgeon cut nurse training places – calling it a “sensible way forward”. Scotland now has more than 2500 vacancies for nurses and midwives.

But Labour’s plan to invest in public services in England will result in a massive boost for Scotland’s budget. EDUCATION Under the SNP, teacher numbers have declined by 4000, there are 1000 fewer support staff and ­Scotland’s performance in ­international assessments of maths, science and reading is declining. Meanwhile, the gap in educational attainment separating children from richer and poorer ­backgrounds remains as stubborn as ever. In 2007, the SNP ran on a key manifesto promise to abolish student debt, which they have broken. Instead, student debt has soared. But Labour’s education policies in England will result in a major spending boost for Scotland. (Image: PA/Getty) POLICE Since the SNP’s shambolic ­centralisation of Police Scotland, policing has lurched from one crisis to another. Audit Scotland have highlighted a black hole at the heart of Police Scotland’s budget. The number of full-time police officers has fallen over the past year, while the SNP’s failure to fully fund their promise of 1000 extra officers has resulted in frontline officers having to fill back-office functions rather than being out on the beat. Under a Labour ­government, Scotland will receive £70million which we can use to ensure officers can focus on policing and protecting our communities. TRANSPORT (Image: Getty) Major road-building projects have been delayed, bus services are ­deteriorating and satisfaction with ScotRail is at a 14-year low. Instead of listening to Labour and creating a publicly owned rail service, the SNP handed the ScotRail franchise to the Dutch state ­operator Abellio. This has led to passengers suffering delays, cancellations, ­overcrowding and fare increases. Labour will always protect pensioners’ free bus pass from the age of 60. The truth is that nobody can trust a word of the SNP manifesto that Sturgeon will unveil today. Voters who want to send her a message to drop plans for a divisive second independence referendum and focus on running our schools and hospitals need to vote Labour on June 8.",Judgement day is nearing for Nicola Sturgeon's failing government,true,
dca535c0,"TRENTON — In a widely anticipated decision, the New Jersey Supreme Court ordered the state to spend an additional $500 million on public education in poor districts next year. The complex decision does not boost funding statewide, as education advocates had requested, and may avoid creating a gaping hole in a proposed $29.6 billion budget. The 3-2 ruling, however, revealed sharp disagreements among the five justices who heard the case and issued a total of four opinions. Justices could have ordered up to $1.7 billion in additional statewide education spending. Today's ruling gives Gov. Chris Christie and lawmakers some room to maneuver as they work to balance the state's budget by July 1. Christie had argued that the state's current fiscal woes made it impossible to spend the full amount required by the funding formula approved by the court in 2009. Still, the majority opinion written by Associate Justice Jaynee LaVecchia said Christie's cuts to education spending have been ""consequential and significant"" and must be rolled back. She also wrote that the state, which had promised to fully fund the formula, cannot back away from it when funding poor districts. TODAY'S COVERAGE: • Gov. Christie: Legislature must decide how to fund Supreme Court Abbott decision • Senate President Sweeney, lawmakers react to N.J. Supreme Court decision restoring $500M to Abbott districts • Read the complete ruling (PDF) ""Indeed, our holding in (the 2009 case) was a good-faith demonstration of deference to the political branches’ authority, not an invitation to retreat from the hard-won progress that our state had made toward guaranteeing the children in Abbott districts the promise of educational opportunity,"" she wrote. ""Regrettably, the state did not honor its commitment."" The court's decision stems from a legal battle over whether Christie's cuts to education spending last year were unconstitutional. The Newark-based Education Law Center, which brought the lawsuit against the state, argued that the cuts violated the state's constitutional requirement to provide a ""thorough and efficient system of free public schools."" In response, the Christie administration said the state doesn't have enough money to spend more on schools and argued that the court should not inject itself into the budget-making process. Conservatives including Christie have fiercely criticized the court's actions over the years, saying justices have mistakenly treated more funding as a cure-all for poor districts' education woes. PREVIOUS COVERAGE: • Christie refuses to talk about flouting N.J. Supreme Court if it orders more school funding • If N.J. Supreme Court orders increased school aid, Gov. Christie says not complying is among 'options' • Gov. Christie's legal team tells N.J.

Supreme Court to hear arguments on constitutionality of Christie's education budget cuts • Education Law Center motion could restore N.J. school funding cut by Gov. Christie • The History of Abbott v. Burke The court’s decision caps the latest round in the historic and controversial school funding case Abbott v. Burke, which has routed billions of dollars to the state’s neediest students over the past three decades in an effort to equalize spending between New Jersey’s poorest and wealthiest districts. Because the original lawsuit, filed in 1981, was brought on behalf of only 31 poor school districts, the court narrowed its ruling to affect only the so-called ""Abbott districts."" ""Although we are sympathetic to the difficulties that the state’s failure to abide by its statutory formula for education funding has caused to children in districts statewide, we are limited in our ability to order relief in this matter,"" LaVecchia wrote. She added, ""The Abbott litigation has proceeded with two distinct adversarial parties: on the one side, New Jersey schoolchildren who attend schools in certain constitutionally deficient districts; and on the other side, the state, who has defended its funding schemes as consistent with the thorough and efficient clause."" The decision released today was apparently influenced by a March report written by Superior Court Judge Peter Doyne, who was appointed by the court as a ""special master"" to study the issue and issue recommendations. Doyne concluded that funding cuts disproportionately harmed at-risk students in poor districts, breaking the state's constitutional obligations. ""Despite the state's best efforts, the reductions fell more heavily upon our high-risk districts and the children educated within those districts,"" Doyne wrote. In a concurring opinion, Associate Justice Barry Albin, who has been the target of much of Christie's criticism surrounding this case, argued that funding should be increased in 205 school districts attended by 72 percent of the state's at-risk students. ""Those school districts were constitutionally shortchanged in the amount of $972,930,819 for FY 2011 under (the school funding formula),"" Albin wrote. ""We cannot undo the past for the affected at-risk children; we can remediate their future."" Associate Justice Roberto Rivera-Soto dissented, arguing that there weren't enough affirmative votes to require the state to follow the order. Joined by Associate Justice Helen Hoens, he argued that, as a matter of practice, four affirmative votes are needed to grant a motion. ""Although unwritten, that practice is borne out by the relevant empirical data,"" Rivera-Soto wrote. He said the only cases decided by a 3-2 decision were temporary injunctions, not permanent rulings. Because of the gravity of the case, he wrote, ""it is simply incomprehensible that any impartial observer would give them equal dignity."" Chief Justice Stuart Rabner and Associate Justice Virginia Long had recused themselves from the case, leaving five justices. LaVecchia, in the majority decision, rejected the arguments made by Rivera-Soto and Hoens. ""The dissenters’ transparent attempt at nullification of a decision with which they disagree fails on every factual and legal basis,"" she wrote. In another dissenting opinion, Hoens argued that the court was outside of its power to force more spending. ""Nothing in this record supports any of those essential findings,"" she wrote. Hoens was joined by Rivera-Soto in the dissent. Staff writers Jessica Calefati, Ginger Gibson and Jeanette Rundquist contributed to this report.

Go Nakamura | Getty Images News | Getty Images.  Delta 'greatest threat' to U.S.  The first thing to note is how quickly the delta variant spread across the U.K. In a relatively short amount of time, the strain supplanted the alpha variant to become dominant in the country (in mid-June delta was responsible for 90% of all infections, a government study showed) — and this happened despite the U.K.'s advanced vaccination rate. Meanwhile, cases attributed to the delta strain now make up around 20% of newly diagnosed cases in the U.S. according to White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci. Fauci warned last week that the delta variant is set to become the dominant Covid strain in the country in a matter of weeks, citing the U.K. as precedent. ""It just exploded in the U.K. It went from a minor variant to now more than 90% of the isolates in the U.K.,"" Fauci said on NBC's ""TODAY"" show. He said the variant has a doubling time of about two weeks. ""So you would expect, just the doubling time, you know, in several weeks to a month or so it's going to be quite dominant, that's the sobering news,"" he added. Read more: Fauci says delta accounts for 20% of new cases and will be dominant Covid variant in U.S. in weeks Fauci had already warned that delta appears to be ""following the same pattern"" as alpha. ""Similar to the situation in the U.K., the delta variant is currently the greatest threat in the U.S. to our attempt to eliminate Covid-19,"" he said. In the U.K., infections attributed to delta have spread rapidly among young people and anyone older who has not yet been vaccinated. Similarly, in the U.S., there are concerns that delta could rapidly spread in parts of the South where vaccinations have stalled, NBC News reported Sunday.  The U.S. is not alone in its concern over the delta variant. In Australia, Sydney was put under a two week lockdown over the weekend amid a growing outbreak of the strain. The Australian government's Covid response team is set to meet Monday to discuss the spread of the virus and the possibility of more restrictions.  Vaccination rush  New outbreaks of infections largely blamed on the delta variant have prompted the U.K.'s government to speed up the last leg of its immunization program for people aged 18 and over. It's hoped that stepping up vaccinations will help stop the wild spread of the strain. Analysis from Public Health England released June 21 showed that two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech or the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines are highly effective against hospitalization from the delta variant. To date, almost 60% of all U.K. adults have received two doses of the vaccine, while in the U.S., 56% of the population over 18 has been fully vaccinated. The U.K. has not yet authorized Covid shots for adolescents, unlike the U.S. which is giving vaccines to the over-12s.

,"Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel is going after a right-wing news site, demanding it take down misleading videos of poll worker trainings in Detroit.  In an Oct. 28 cease and desist letter, Nessel told Big League Politics the videos violate Michigan law because they contain ""misleading and false election information,"" according to a photo of the letter posted to the conservative blog Gateway Pundit.  Nessel's spokesperson Ryan Jarvi confirmed Tuesday the attorney general sent a letter to the site and what Gateway Pundit posted appeared to be authentic. Nessel's office will release a statement about the cease and desist later this week, Jarvi said.  The videos no longer appear to be live on Big League Politics' website, though a combined version of the audio exists on the video-sharing platform Bitchute, which is known for hosting the far-right and conspiracy theorists.  Big League Politics is a right-wing news site started in 2017 by former Breitbart employees, according to The Atlantic. The HuffPost called the site a place “for people who find Breitbart too reasonable.” It has been known to promote false claims and conspiracy theories.  In the weeks leading up to the election, Big League Politics reporter Shane Trejo posted stories using audio recordings of what he said was a poll worker training in Detroit. The videos didn’t record images of the training; rather it showed subtitles of what was said as the audio played.  More:Antrim County figures prominently in election conspiracy theory  For subscribers:Internet sleuths are trying to prove dead people voted in Michigan  The videos contained false information about how poll workers counted challenged votes prior to 2020, Nessel said. The videos also make a false statement about whether challenged ballots could be taken out of the official count. Challengers have six days to prove a vote was improper, Nessel wrote in the letter.  Nessel told the site to take the videos down as well as any stories under the ""#DetroitLeaks"" title.  The videos are considered misinformation, a term used to describe false or misleading information. If misinformation is spread with the intent to mislead, then it is disinformation.  ""Other portions of the video clips posted on your site are taken out of context or deceptively edited,"" Nessel's office wrote in the letter. ""Further, they do not portray accurate information.""  This is a big part of these influence campaigns, said Josh Tucker, a New York University professor of politics and co-director of NYU's Center for Social Media and Politics. It isn't always faking things, Tucker said.  ""If you think of attending every single training, for every single poll worker everywhere and somebody cracking a joke at one point about something, right, or splicing something somebody said, of course you're going to be able to find things that sound suspicious,"" he said.  In 2019, Big League Politics broke the story that Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam wore either blackface or a Ku Klux Klan robe as a costume in a yearbook photo. The site is backed by Republican operatives, according to the Wall Street Journal.

90d7df46,"COVID-19 has left many struggling to pay rent, but Asheville resident Rachel Atkins is facing a different housing challenge: She was told she had to pay a full 12-month lease in advance because of her job in the service industry. Atkins, who works at a downtown restaurant, has been trying to find a house and move in with her partner. They found a property at 74 Livingston St. and scheduled a viewing on June 22. The house was perfect, and within an hour, they had submitted an application with WNC Property Management, which oversees the rental. The next morning, Atkins received the following email from WNC Property Management: “Since your employment is in the service industry, and many businesses in the service industry are currently struggling, closed or potentially closing in the near future, you would be required to prepay your 12-month lease in advance.” Atkins offered to send previous pay stubs and a letter from her employers verifying her job. But that wasn’t good enough. “[W]e are in very challenging and uncertain economic times, and there is a good chance that many businesses in the service industry will be closing over the next 12 months,” a response from the property managers read. BACK AND FORTH: Atkins received the following email message from WNC Property Management after submitting an application for a house at 74 Livingston St. Screen capture courtesy of Rachel Atkins The bill for the entire 12-month lease added up to $14,400, Atkins said. After the property manager said it couldn’t compromise, she posted the exchange to Facebook, prompting hundreds of comments in several locally oriented Facebook groups. “I just feel stressed out about finding a spot to move in,” Atkins said. “It’s already a tricky market without adding in all these layers.” Jim Barrett, executive director of Asheville-based nonprofit Pisgah Legal Services, says that requiring a year’s rent in advance is likely legal. However, he continues, the requirement may run counter to “the spirit of the residential security deposit law.” “This practice probably does not violate the Fair Housing laws because working in a particular job is not a protected class, ordinarily,” Barrett said. “Landlords can discriminate based on credit checks, so I guess landlords can require a prospective tenant to demonstrate ability to pay.” WNC Property Management posted a statement to its Facebook page, saying “rent prepayment is not our company policy across the board for the service industry, as many have jumped to the conclusion. “For this particular property, a [previous] tenant lost their job and was unable to pay rent, and the homeowner is requiring our company to ask all future tenants, where 100% of household income comes from a service industry job, to prepay their rent,” the statement continued. “We are contractually obligated to follow our client’s instructions. “We stand with all those that work in Asheville’s service industry and realize that they are the fabric of our city and regret that our initial response did not reflect this. As a small, locally owned business that has been hit as well, we empathize with anyone that has been affected by these challenging economic times. We have had to shut down the vacation rental management part of our business and have suffered large financial losses as a result.” After receiving multiple comments on that statement, the management group released a subsequent message, which read: “The property in question has been removed from the market as the owner understands some were having trouble meeting a prepaid lease agreement. They understand the difficult time that many are going through right now and in no way wanted to add to anyone’s difficulties. They are now weighing options moving forward, and in the meantime, we have chosen not to relist the property unless it can be offered with no prepaid requirement.” Atkins doubts she will apply for the house in question after her experience but says she is happy other people may now be able to qualify for a home.",Restaurant employee challenges property group on prepaid lease,true,
d0b0e459,"Scientists have long known about the anomalous ""warming hole"" in the North Atlantic Ocean, an area immune to warming of Earth's oceans. This cool zone in the North Atlantic Ocean appears to be associated with a slowdown in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), one of the key drivers in global ocean circulation. A recent study published in Nature outlines research by a team of Yale University and University of Southhampton scientists. The team found evidence that Arctic ice loss is potentially negatively impacting the planet's largest ocean circulation system. While scientists do have some analogs as to how this may impact the world, we will be largely in uncharted territory. AMOC is one of the largest current systems in the Atlantic Ocean and the world. Generally speaking, it transports warm and salty water northward from the tropics to South and East of Greenland. This warm water cools to ambient water temperature then sinks as it is saltier and thus denser than the relatively more fresh surrounding water. The dense mass of water sinks to the base of the North Atlantic Ocean and is pushed south along the abyss of the Atlantic Ocean. Schematic of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation This process whereby water is transported into the Northern Atlantic Ocean acts to distribute ocean water globally. What's more important, and the basis for concern of many scientists is this mechanism is one of the most efficient ways Earth transports heat from the tropics to the northern latitudes. The warm water transported from the tropics to the North Atlantic releases heat to the atmosphere, playing a key role in warming of western Europe. You likely have heard of one of the more popular components of the AMOC, the Gulf Stream which brings warm tropical water to the western coasts of Europe. Evidence is growing that the comparatively cold zone within the Northern Atlantic could be due to a slowdown of this global ocean water circulation. Hence, a slowdown in the planet's ability to transfer heat from the tropics to the northern latitudes. The cold zone could be due to melting of ice in the Arctic and Greenland. This would cause a cold fresh water cap over the North Atlantic, inhibiting sinking of salty tropical waters. This would in effect slow down the global circulation and hinder the transport of warm tropical waters north. Measured trend in temperature variations from 1900 to 2012. Melting of the Arctic sea ice has rapidly increased in the recent decades. Satellite image records indicate that September Arctic sea ice is 30% less today than it was in 1979. This trend of increased sea ice melting during summer months does not appear to be slowing. Hence, indications are that we will see a continued weakening of the global ocean circulation system. This scenario of a collapse in AMOC and global ocean circulation is the premise for the movie ""The Day After Tomorrow."" As a disclaimer, the plot line in which much of New England and Western Europe gets plunged into an ice age is significantly over exaggerated and unrealistic on human time scales. While geologists have studied events in the past similar to what appears to be happening today, scientists are largely unsure of what lies ahead.",Global Ocean Circulation Appears To Be Collapsing Due To A Warming Planet,true,

She now works as a lead on the floor, roaming as she checks on the flow of work, supervising other sewing machine operators and embroiders. She became a citizen when she was 20; her parents are permanent residents. Melendrez was 14 when she had her first child, and the job has helped her pay rent and put food on the table for her kids, she says. Workers stitch together hats on the factory floor of Cali-Fame in Carson. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times) One recent Saturday at the Cali-Fame factory, about 20 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, dozens of employees, almost all of them Latino, were working away while machines whirred all around them. Some peered over glasses as their deft hands assembled one hat after another; others swept scraps of fabric from the floor. They were surrounded by stacks of freshly minted camouflage-print caps, with the presidential hopeful’s all-capital-letter promise emblazoned on the front in orange. Advertisement Brian Kennedy, president of Cali-Fame, says that when the Trump campaign asked his family business to make the now-famous hats, he knew he would need to address his workers. “I said to them, ‘We’re not political. We’re here to work,’” Kennedy told the Los Angeles Times from the second floor of his factory, the steady sound of sewing machines in action below him. “And I haven’t gotten any negative comments.” The hats, known best in the signature red with white font, have inspired hipster fashion trends, Halloween costumes, a make-your-own-Trump-hat generator and even a short-lived rumor they actually were made in China. (They weren’t, Kennedy assures). In fact, unlike some Trump-branded lines of clothing sold nationally, this headwear is legitimately made in the USA, creating jobs for people who hail from the very places Trump has at times disparaged. The company employs about 100 people in a 30,000-square-foot warehouse. About 80% of the company’s workforce is Latino, Kennedy estimates. He says that every worker has his or her immigration status verified. The “Make America Great Again” hats have been a boon to Kennedy’s business, which pulled in more than $270,000 from the Trump campaign last quarter, according to campaign finance records. The merchandise was a portion of the more than $825,000 the Trump campaign dropped on bumper stickers, T-shirts, hats and other promotional gear, the largest category of Trump’s spending outside of travel. The hats have seemingly been a boon for Trump’s campaign too. Most of the caps sell for $25 each and appear to have boosted the billionaire’s small donations column, making donors of those who purchase them, ironically or not. SIGN UP for the free Essential Politics newsletter >> Kennedy and his brother, Tim, Cali-Fame’s vice president of sales, have been reluctant to wade into the political fray. Brian Kennedy, who initially declined to be interviewed, says he’s turned down dozens of media requests. Advertisement A visit to the factory on a weekday suggests the business might have easily remained anonymous, save for campaign finance records: The windows were black and no signs of life were obvious early one evening, except for a few modestly appointed cars in the parking lot. Kennedy and his brother bristled at the news coverage they received for weeks after campaign finance disclosures were released. Melendrez says she tries her best to avoid it too. She says she’s heard some of the things Trump has said about Mexican immigrants and Latinos like her, but she attempts to ignore them, even as headlines about Trump’s proposals to build an impenetrable wall on the border of Mexico and his comments writing off some Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals continue to dominate coverage of the Republican front-runner’s campaign. Advertisement When Macy’s cut ties with Trump over his remarks, which the company said were “inconsistent with Macy’s values,” Trump publicly accused the retailer of supporting illegal immigration. “A lot of what he says about Latinos is not correct,” Melendrez says with a shrug just as a buzzer signals the end of her Saturday overtime shift and workers line up to clock out. Spanish punctuates the air as the machines sputter to a stop. But Melendrez doesn’t pay the media reports much mind. She knows she has a job to do. “You know,” she says, “he’s giving us a lot of work. Keeping us busy.… It’s a job, I get paid to do it and it pays my bills.” And for that, Melendrez says, she’s thankful. Brian Kennedy is president of Cali-Fame. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times) A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign did not return a request for comment. Although Kennedy downplayed the role Trump’s orders have played for his business as the holiday season begins, several employees said this is the busiest November they’ve seen in years, with plenty of overtime work to go around. Kennedy says that since his father bought the business in 1977, Cali-Fame has weathered rising labor costs, employee downsizing, changing technologies and cutthroat competition from cheap overseas labor. Advertisement The factory is on the edge of an industrial district that presses up against tight rows of neatly fenced single-story homes. On the other side of the 710 Freeway and across the L.A. River is a country club and golf course serving Long Beach’s nearby tony neighborhoods. “To be a local manufacturer in the United States, there’s so many challenges, not only in America but in California alone,” he says while surveying the massive warehouse. For decades, the company had its bread and butter in golf tournament caps and other promotional headwear. The company has taken in other work, Kennedy says, such as embroidering ready-made shirts and sweatshirts, to help boost revenue. More recently, the manufacturer has branched out into street wear and urban fashion, launching a brand that has focused on supporting burgeoning clothing companies. Wood panels separate a portion of the warehouse for a showroom of sorts, allowing Cali-Fame to host an occasional sale. On a recent weekend, curious deal-seekers browsed straw fedoras and baseball caps of varying designs, but no Trump hats were in sight. “The old cliche is that you roll with the punches,” Tim Kennedy says. “We’ve done that many times, and we’re constantly changing what we do and how we do things.” But it’s been increasingly difficult to stay competitive, the Kennedy brothers say. Rising healthcare costs, the possibility of a $15 minimum wage countywide and workers’ compensation laws have been a “juggling act” to keep up with, they say. Brian Kennedy says his company has been making hats for Trump’s golf courses for about a decade, which is how he got connected with the campaign. These caps -- “the five-panel trucker hat with cord,” Kennedy will tell you -- have become a solid front-runner when it comes to 2016 campaign kitsch. “It’s a classic,” says Tim Kennedy. “Everything comes full circle in the fashion business. It’s straight from Middle America to New York and Los Angeles.” Advertisement For more on politics in the Golden State, follow me @cmaiduc. For more, go to www.latimes.com/politics.

Some coronavirus victims could be temporarily buried in the Hart Island potter’s field — or even public parks — if New York’s morgues become overwhelmed by the number of dead, officials said Monday. They floated the heart-wrenching option as the city death toll climbed to 2,738 and the caseload hit 68,776 — accounting for more than half of the Empire State’s 4,758 fatalities and 130,689 cases. “We may well be dealing with temporary burials so we can deal with each family later,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio in a press briefing at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. “Obviously the place we have used historically is Hart Island.” Located in the Long Island Sound off The Bronx’s southeast coast, the desolate spit of land is the nation’s largest public burial ground, with a macabre history. It has hosted a Civil War prison camp, a colony for tuberculosis patients, and became the resting place for thousands of HIV/AIDS victims during the 1980s who were abandoned by families or unable to receive proper burials. De Blasio — who has been loath to publicly discuss how New York would handle the overwhelming body count — faced the ghastly reality after City Councilman Mark Levine raised an even more dire possibility. “Soon we’ll start ‘temporary interment.’ This likely will be done by using a NYC park for burials (yes you read that right),” the Manhattan Democrat tweeted prior to de Blasio’s remarks. “Trenches will be dug for 10 caskets in a line. “It will be done in a dignified, orderly — and temporary — manner. But it will be tough for NYers to take.” Levine, chair of the council’s Health Committee, clarified in a later tweet that the plan to convert parks into makeshift cemeteries was a “contingency,” and City Hall said it wasn’t happening — for now. “We are NOT currently planning to use local parks as burial grounds,” tweeted mayoral rep Freddi Goldstein. “We are exploring using Hart Island for temporary burials, if the need grows.” As New Yorkers were still dying by the hundreds, Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday again voiced guarded optimism that the wave may be cresting. After a record 630 deaths were logged Saturday, the number fell to 594 Sunday, and stayed “effectively flat” with 599 on Monday. “The flattening — possible flattening — of the curve is better than the increases that we have seen,” said Cuomo in his daily Albany press briefing. Longtime Cuomo aide Dr. Jim Malatras agreed that New York may be turning a corner. “This could suggest that we are indeed, potentially, at the apex,” said Malatras, while cautioning that this is far from over. “It looks like we are towards the earlier side of the projection.” If the disease is truly hitting its apex, it comes just in time for New York’s overtaxed hospitals. “This is a hospital system where we have our foot to the floor,” Cuomo said. “The engine is at redline, and you can’t go any faster. You can’t stay at redline for any period of time, because the system will blow.” To ease the pressure, President Trump on Monday granted Cuomo’s request for the hospital ship docked along Manhattan’s West Side — the USNS Comfort — to take on COVID-19 patients. The 1,000-bed vessel was originally reserved for non-coronavirus patients, but hadn’t seen many cases in the shut-down city. “That is a welcome relief,” Cuomo told MSNBC of the move.

,"Pilot Nicholas Synnott spoke to ABC 30 after being leaving a Texas hospital in December 2020. (ABC 30)  A British Airways pilot who spent a record 243 days in a hospital in Texas while suffering from Covid-19 before returning home, has died in a hospital in the UK.  Nicholas Synnott, 60, was a father of two who was infected with the virus more than a year ago while flying between London and Houston. He died last week, MailOnline reported.  Mr Synnott was admitted to a hospital in Houston in March 2020. The cause of his death remains unclear, but it’s probable that his death was related to the aftermath of surviving Covid-19 as doctors have said that his organs suffered severe damage as a result of the virus.  Houston Doctor Bindu Akkanti said it was remarkable that Mr Synnott managed to get out of the American hospital as he was comatose and went through several organ failures.  Mr Synnott is survived by his wife Nicola, 54, a school administrator, and his two children, charity worker Rebecca, 24, and George, 21, who is in training to also be a pilot, MailOnline reported.  Captain Al Bridger, director of flight operations at British Airways, said: “We are devastated by this incredibly sad news. Nick was a valued member of our pilot family and a friend to many at the airline. Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this extremely difficult time.”  The family of Mr Synnott have asked those who want to support the family to donate to the charity where his daughter works, The Children’s Trust. The charity supports children with brain injuries.  “Nick was a much-loved husband, father, brother, uncle and friend. He will be dearly missed by all that knew him,” a fundraising page said.  “In lieu of flowers, please make a donation on Nick’s behalf to The Children's Trust, where Rebecca (Nick's daughter) works,” the message continued.  During his illness, Mr Synnott was on a ventilator after suffering respiratory failure. He was later treated using a heart and lung machine, according to doctors.  After leaving the hospital in Houston, Mr Synnott told ABC 30: “My temperature was spiking over 100 degrees... then I went through sort of a dark phase where psychologically there were issues I had to come to terms with.”  Story continues  “Every organ of his body was affected by Covid-19,” Dr Biswajit Kar told ABC 30. “But yet, because his health was so good as a pilot prior to the illness, he could sustain all this and survive something as serious as this. We were firstly overwhelmed by the joy that someone this sick could make it.”  When asked how Mr Synnott managed to survive, Dr Akkanti credited his wife, who was at his bedside every day for almost eight months.  “There was always a question, ‘Is he even in there?’ Given the enormous number of... medications [and] the other multi-organ issues that were happening. I think all of us on our team agreed that it was his wife,” Dr Akkanti said.  Mr Synnott told ABC 30 in December 2020 that he managed to get through the eight-month hospital stay “with the support of my wife, and the thought of going back to my kids. It was a tough journey but, we’ve got where we are”.

Wade, which is why I went to the front lines in Georgia to fight for them. As president, I will take on the fights that no one else will. I stood up to the Pentagon and repealed Don’t Ask Don’t Tell. I’ve stood up to the banks and voted against the bail out twice. I’ve stood up to Trump more than any other senator in the U.S. Senate. And I have the most comprehensive approach for getting money out of politics with publicly funded elections to deal with political corruption.  Now is not the time to play it safe. Now is not the time to be afraid of first. We need a president who will take on the big challenges even if she stands alone. Join me in fighting for this.  GUTHRIE:  Senator Gillibrand, thank you.  HOLT:  Mr. Yang, you have 45 seconds—  (APPLAUSE)  —for your closing.  YANG:  First, I want to thank everyone who put me on this stage tonight. I am proof that our democracy still works. Democrats and Americans around the country have one question for their nominee and that is who can beat Donald Trump in 2020. That is the right question. And the right candidate to beat Donald Trump will be solving the problems that got Donald Trump elected and will have a vision of a trickle up economy that is already drawing thousands of disaffected Trump voters, conservatives, independents, and libertarians, as well as Democrats and progressives. I am that candidate. I can build a much broader coalition to beat Donald Trump. It is not left. It is not right. It is forward and that is where I’ll take the country in 2020.  HOLT:  Mr. Yang, thank you.  (APPLAUSE)  GUTHRIE:  Senator Harris. Senator Harris, the floor is yours.  HARRIS:  Thank you. Well, I—I just want to leave you with a couple of things.

This is about your hopes and your dreams and your fears and what wakes you up at 3:00 in the morning. And that’s why I have what I call a 3:00 a.m. agenda that is about everything from what we need to do to deliver healthcare to how you will be able to pay the bills by the end of the month.  And when I think about what our country needs, I promise you I will be a president who leads with a sense of dignity, with honest, speaking the truth, and giving the American family all that they need to get through the end of the month in a way that allows them to prosper.

,"Pope Francis launches a powerful appeal for people to get vaccinated with approved Covid-19 vaccines, calling it “an act of love.”  By Devin Watkins  The Pope has joined his voice to those of Bishops across North and South America to urge people to get jabbed against Covid-19.  In a video message produced in conjunction with the Ad Council, Pope Francis praised the work of researchers and scientists in producing safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines.  “Thanks to God’s grace and to the work of many, we now have vaccines to protect us from Covid-19,” he said in the video released on Wednesday.  He added that vaccines “bring hope to end the pandemic, but only if they are available to all and if we collaborate with one another.”  Vaccination is an act of love  Pope Francis went on to say that getting a Covid jab that is “authorized by the respective authorities” is an “act of love.”  Helping other do the same, he said, is also an act of love. “Love for oneself, love for our families and friends, and love for all peoples. Love is also social and political.”  The Pope noted that social and political love is built up through “small, individual gestures capable of transforming and improving societies.”  “Getting vaccinated is a simple yet profound way to care for one another, especially the most vulnerable,” he said.  Pope Francis then prayed to God that “each one of us can make his or her own small gesture of love.”  “No matter how small, love is always grand,” he said. “Small gestures for a better future.”  Listen to our report  ‘Strength of faith’  The Pope was joined in the video by several Cardinals and Archbishops from across the Americas.  Archbishop Jose Gomez, president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Archbishop of Los Angeles, lamented the suffering and death the pandemic has wrought across the globe.  He prayed that God might “grant us the grace to face it with the strength of faith, ensuring that vaccines are available for all, so that we can all get immunized.”  Mexican Cardinal Carlos Aguiar Retes linked Covid-19 jabs to a better future for all.  “From North to South America, we support vaccinations for all,” said the Cardinal.  Safe, effective vaccines  Honduran Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga said the world has much to learn from the coronavirus.  “But one thing is certain: the authorized vaccines are effective, and are here to save lives,” he said. “They are the key to a path of personal and universal healing.”  Brazilian Cardinal Claudio Hummes praised the “heroic efforts” of health professionals in developing “safe and effective” jabs.  He also repeated the Pope’s affirmation that “getting vaccinated is an act of love”.  Salvadorian Cardinal Gregorio Rosa Chavez said vaccination helps protect the most vulnerable.  “Our choice to get vaccinated affects others,” he said, adding that it is a moral responsibility.  Unity across the Americas  Peruvian Archbishop Miguel Cabrejos rounded out the testimonies contained in the video with an appeal to unity.  “We are united—North, Central, and South America and the Caribbean—to promote and support vaccination for all,” he said, encouraging everyone to “act responsibly, as members of the great human family, seeking and protecting our integral health and universal vaccination.”",Pope Francis urges people to get vaccinated against Covid-19,true,140473399847672697712248024445972944941

By any measure, the United States has some of the top public health experts in the world. Yet as the novel coronavirus began to spread early this year, these U.S. experts repeatedly recommended against a simple tactic to prevent spreading the infection: face masks.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in January that it did not recommend the use of masks for “people who are well.” On Feb. 29, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams went further, tweeting a warning: “STOP BUYING MASKS.”  But weeks later, the advice was reversed. On April 3, as the number of deaths from the coronavirus in the United States surged to more than 7,000, the CDC altered its recommendation to state that “cloth face coverings” should be worn when social distance cannot be maintained.  When states first began lifting coronavirus lockdown measures in the summer, tensions around face masks had been mounting since the CDC first recommended them. (Video: The Washington Post, Photo: Sarah Hashemi/The Washington Post)  Still, even as the changed policy was announced, President Trump said he would not personally be doing it. Some Republican lawmakers have mocked the practice of wearing masks, while local rules requiring masks have been rescinded in some locations following a backlash.  Advertisement  The U-turn regarding masks and the subsequent political divide over them has come to symbolize the chaos of the U.S. response to the still-raging pandemic. It also may be particularly damaging for America’s global standing, as it has drawn in not just political leaders like Trump but also widely respected public health experts who did not initially back the wearing of face masks.  “I’ve always thought of the CDC as a reliable and trusted source of information,” Siouxsie Wiles, an infectious-diseases specialist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, told The Post last week. “Not anymore.”  Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a key adviser on the pandemic in the early months, was asked at a House hearing this week whether he regretted the previous advice against masks.  Advertisement  Fauci said he did not regret the decision, arguing that at the time there was a “paucity of equipment” for front-line health workers.  Pool shot of audience at Pres. Trump’s speech in Arizona - the nation’s latest coronavirus hotspot - shows a single mask-wearer among the students sitting shoulder-to-shoulder. pic.twitter.com/SrbGnoGBTL — Kayla Tausche (@kaylatausche) June 23, 2020  The debate about masks could intensify in coming weeks as U.S. cases surge amid economic reopening. Some state governments are newly moving to mandate the wearing of masks in public, but plenty of people, including the president and some of his supporters, still rarely wear one.  In other nations, there is no such divide. In many Asian countries, surgical masks were socially acceptable long before the coronavirus pandemic, partly as a result of experience in past pandemics, like SARS in 2003.  “In Hong Kong, it is pretty common, even without an outbreak, to see people going around in masks because they may be sick and they don’t want to infect other people,” Keiji Fukuda, head of the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health, told Today’s WorldView in March.  Advertisement  As suspicion grew that asymptomatic cases were spreading the virus, many holdouts changed course. Singapore initially advised the general public against wearing masks but reversed that guidance, implementing a law on April 14 that imposed a $212 fine for those who flouted the rules.  Conducting high-quality research about the effectiveness of masks against the novel coronavirus is difficult during a pandemic, but a spate of studies released this summer supported mask-wearing.  One review funded by the World Health Organization and published in the Lancet journal looked at data from 172 observational studies and concluded that wearing face masks reduced the risk of coronavirus infection.  For many, this was all the evidence needed. Other policies for controlling the spread of the virus are enormously costly and practically difficult, from shutting down schools and offices to setting up complicated contact tracing. A mask, on the other hand, is cheap and has little downside.  Advertisement  And yet the U.S. president avoids wearing a mask in public, joining a small group of leaders that includes Mexico’s Andrés Manuel López Obrador and Belarus’s Alexander Lukashenko.  Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who brushed off the threat of the virus as his country amassed the second-highest death toll in the world, was this week ordered by a Brazilian federal judge to wear a mask when in public in Brasília.  VIDEO: Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has worn a face mask at an official event in Brasilia, following a ruling by a federal judge ordering him to wear one in public spaces. Brazil is the second hardest-hit country by the virus worldwide pic.twitter.com/V63X08liMR — AFP news agency (@AFP) June 24, 2020  The divide over masks in the United States cannot be blamed on the president’s vanity alone, however. As Fauci noted on Tuesday, there were early U.S. concerns about the availability of surgical masks and N95 masks for essential workers, which had a distorting effect on the debate.  Supply concerns are also believed to have influenced the WHO’s belated decision to change its own global guidance in favor of masks since June 5, as some nations would not have been able to supply masks.  Advertisement  Other factors include the United States’ decentralized political system, as well as Americans’ focus on protecting individual liberty. “Making individual decisions is the American way,” Max Parsell, a 29-year-old power-line worker in Jacksonville, Fla., recently told The Post as he justified his decision not to wear a mask.  But the relentless toll of the pandemic on the United States, as well as the ensuing protests after the death of George Floyd, has left many outside nations reappraising the world’s lone superpower.  “We live with the idea that the U.S. has an ability to rebound that is almost unlimited,” Michel Duclos, a former French ambassador to Syria, told the Atlantic recently. “For the first time, I’m starting to have some doubts.”  The United States has faced serious blows to its international reputation before, notably after the 2003 invasion of Iraq and any number of decisions involving Trump since 2016. However, this time it isn’t just partisan political leaders who are facing hard questions, but also apolitical subject experts.  Advertisement  Bloomberg Opinion this week asked writers around the world what they thought of the U.S. response to the coronavirus, and several mentioned the politically charged debate over masks, as well as broader concerns about the way the United States uses the expertise it has built up.  “America has some of the very best professionals and hospitals in the world,” Ferninando Guigliano, an Italian columnist, explained. “But it lacks a centralized structure that gives you confidence that the country as a whole can counter the pandemic effectively.”  This story has been updated with details regarding the WHO’s guidance on masks.

,"Even when the pandemic is finally behind us, Ontario's courts will likely be dealing with COVID-19 lawsuits for years to come.  There are already some suits filed claiming wrongful deaths in long-term care homes, a lack of disability coverage for so-called COVID ""long haulers"" with lingering symptoms and a class action suit claiming the government's masking laws are violating constitutional rights.  A class action suit filed by Ottawa lawyer Michael Swinwood is going even further.  ""It's a challenge to what is being put before humanity,"" he says.  ""We're saying straight up that there is no justification for the declaration of a pandemic ... I'd go so far as to say that what medical science says is that this is no worse than a seasonal flu.""  Ottawa lawyer Michael Swinwood is behind a class action lawsuit claiming that the Canadian and Ontario governments don't have the ""lawful authority"" to impose COVID restrictions on the public. (Micki Cowan/CBC)  The suit is filed against the Canadian and Ontario governments, individual political leaders, as well as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Health Organization and the Pope.  It claims that all the defendants allowed for the bringing in of COVID restrictions and shutdowns ""without lawful authority and due process on behalf of the mind, body and health of the Canadian Public.""  The class of Ontario claimants includes the owner of a convenience store in Henvey Inlet First Nation south of Sudbury, a small business owner in Peterborough, a man living with disabilities in Balderson and a single mother in downtown Toronto.  Each is seeking $1 million, as are the likely millions of ""John and Jane Does"" named in the suit representing everyone else affected by the pandemic.  Swinwood says he expects the governments will claim the suit is ""frivolous and vexatious"" but ""that doesn't matter, the facts are all there.""  The Ontario government is trying to limit COVID lawsuits, with a law passed in November forbidding claims against employers and others who make an ""honest effort"" to follow guidelines and prevent spread of the virus.  Elizabeth Keenan— an employment lawyer with Matthews, Dinsdale and Clark in Toronto— says what exactly that means is ""the big question"" that will have to be tested in court.  ""One would imagine that there's a purpose in using that language,"" she says.  But Keenan says workers can still file COVID-related Workplace Safety Insurance Board claims against their employers and those who lost work during the shutdown are already starting to file for what's called a ""constructive dismissal"" in hopes of getting severance pay.  ""We anticipate a flurry of those actions,"" she says.  ""I think we're going to feel the repercussions of this for a long while.""  Toronto personal injury lawyer and York University law professor Joseph Campisi says he expects a range of different suits to come after the pandemic.  ""The next major hurdle will be actually getting in front of a judge,"" he says  ""The backlog is significant before you even get into a court to have your case heard.""  While some cases have been heard in courtrooms and online during the past 11 months, many have been delayed.

Natural drivers, without human intervention, would push our planet toward a cooling period.  Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the ""greenhouse effect""1 — warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.  Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. Long-lived gases that remain semi-permanently in the atmosphere and do not respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are described as ""forcing"" climate change. Gases, such as water vapor, which respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are seen as ""feedbacks.""  Gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect include:  Water vapor. The most abundant greenhouse gas, but importantly, it acts as a feedback to the climate. Water vapor increases as the Earth's atmosphere warms, but so does the possibility of clouds and precipitation, making these some of the most important feedback mechanisms to the greenhouse effect.  Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). A minor but very important component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide is released through natural processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions and through human activities such as deforestation, land use changes, and burning fossil fuels. Humans have increased atmospheric CO 2 concentration by 48% since the Industrial Revolution began. This is the most important long-lived ""forcing"" of climate change.  Methane. A hydrocarbon gas produced both through natural sources and human activities, including the decomposition of wastes in landfills, agriculture, and especially rice cultivation, as well as ruminant digestion and manure management associated with domestic livestock. On a molecule-for-molecule basis, methane is a far more active greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but also one which is much less abundant in the atmosphere.  Nitrous oxide. A powerful greenhouse gas produced by soil cultivation practices, especially the use of commercial and organic fertilizers, fossil fuel combustion, nitric acid production, and biomass burning.  Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Synthetic compounds entirely of industrial origin used in a number of applications, but now largely regulated in production and release to the atmosphere by international agreement for their ability to contribute to destruction of the ozone layer. They are also greenhouse gases.  Not enough greenhouse effect: The planet Mars has a very thin atmosphere, nearly all carbon dioxide. Because of the low atmospheric pressure, and with little to no methane or water vapor to reinforce the weak greenhouse effect, Mars has a largely frozen surface that shows no evidence of life.  Too much greenhouse effect: The atmosphere of Venus, like Mars, is nearly all carbon dioxide. But Venus has about 154,000 times as much carbon dioxide in its atmosphere as Earth (and about 19,000 times as much as Mars does), producing a runaway greenhouse effect and a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead.  On Earth, human activities are changing the natural greenhouse. Over the last century the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). This happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO 2 . To a lesser extent, the clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.  The consequences of changing the natural atmospheric greenhouse are difficult to predict, but some effects seem likely:  On average, Earth will become warmer. Some regions may welcome warmer temperatures, but others may not.  Warmer conditions will probably lead to more evaporation and precipitation overall, but individual regions will vary, some becoming wetter and others dryer.  A stronger greenhouse effect will warm the ocean and partially melt glaciers and ice sheets, increasing sea level. Ocean water also will expand if it warms, contributing further to sea level rise.  Outside of a greenhouse, higher atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) levels can have both positive and negative effects on crop yields. Some laboratory experiments suggest that elevated CO 2 levels can increase plant growth. However, other factors, such as changing temperatures, ozone, and water and nutrient constraints, may more than counteract any potential increase in yield. If optimal temperature ranges for some crops are exceeded, earlier possible gains in yield may be reduced or reversed altogether. Climate extremes, such as droughts, floods and extreme temperatures, can lead to crop losses and threaten the livelihoods of agricultural producers and the food security of communities worldwide. Depending on the crop and ecosystem, weeds, pests, and fungi can also thrive under warmer temperatures, wetter climates, and increased CO 2 levels, and climate change will likely increase weeds and pests. Finally, although rising CO 2 can stimulate plant growth, research has shown that it can also reduce the nutritional value of most food crops by reducing the concentrations of protein and essential minerals in most plant species. Climate change can cause new patterns of pests and diseases to emerge, affecting plants, animals and humans, and posing new risks for food security, food safety and human health.2  The Role of Human Activity  In its Fifth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of 1,300 independent scientific experts from countries all over the world under the auspices of the United Nations, concluded there's a more than 95 percent probability that human activities over the past 50 years have warmed our planet.  The industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels from 280 parts per million to about 417 parts per million in the last 151 years. The panel also concluded there's a better than 95 percent probability that human-produced greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have caused much of the observed increase in Earth's temperatures over the past 50-plus years.  The panel's full Summary for Policymakers report is online at https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf.  Solar Irradiance  The above graph compares global surface temperature changes (red line) and the Sun's energy that Earth receives (yellow line) in watts (units of energy) per square meter since 1880. The lighter/thinner lines show the yearly levels while the heavier/thicker lines show the 11-year average trends. Eleven-year averages are used to reduce the year-to-year natural noise in the data, making the underlying trends more obvious.    The amount of solar energy that Earth receives has followed the Sun’s natural 11-year cycle of small ups and downs with no net increase since the 1950s. Over the same period, global temperature has risen markedly. It is therefore extremely unlikely that the Sun has caused the observed global temperature warming trend over the past half-century. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech  It's reasonable to assume that changes in the Sun's energy output would cause the climate to change, since the Sun is the fundamental source of energy that drives our climate system.  Indeed, studies show that solar variability has played a role in past climate changes. For example, a decrease in solar activity coupled with an increase in volcanic activity is thought to have helped trigger the Little Ice Age between approximately 1650 and 1850, when Greenland cooled from 1410 to the 1720s and glaciers advanced in the Alps.  But several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the Sun:  Since 1750, the average amount of energy coming from the Sun either remained constant or increased slightly.  If the warming were caused by a more active Sun, then scientists would expect to see warmer temperatures in all layers of the atmosphere. Instead, they have observed a cooling in the upper atmosphere, and a warming at the surface and in the lower parts of the atmosphere. That's because greenhouse gases are trapping heat in the lower atmosphere.  Climate models that include solar irradiance changes can’t reproduce the observed temperature trend over the past century or more without including a rise in greenhouse gases.",The Causes of Climate Change,true,164875171000985424656123266880071428516
,"DURHAM, N.C. -- The widespread use of masks in schools can effectively prevent COVID-19 transmission and provide a safe learning environment, two Duke scholars said Wednesday.  Danny Benjamin, M.D., and Kanecia Zimmerman, M.D., were co-chairs of the Duke-led ABC Science Collaborative, which issued a new report Wednesday showing that North Carolina schools were highly successful in preventing the transmission of COVID-19 within school buildings.  The report found in part that masks effectively prevented COVID-19 transmission even without physical distancing in schools and on buses.  Benjamin and Zimmerman spoke to reporters Wednesday in a virtual media briefing. Watch the briefing on YouTube. Read a news story about the collaborative's findings on Duke Health's website.  Here are excerpts:  ON WHAT RESEARCH SUGGESTS FOR SCHOOL THIS FALL  Danny Benjamin  “North Carolina school districts, K-12 education and the charter schools, did an outstanding job of preventing COVID-19 transmission in schools.”  “With masking, the schools clearly can safely deliver face-to-face education for children and adults. They can have one, two or three children (per seat) on the school buses. The amount of distancing, whether it’s less than 6 feet, less than 3 feet or no distancing at all, it didn’t make any difference at all … providing there was masking in place.”  “This means that we don’t have to close schools again. We don’t have to have remote instruction. We’ve got tools that will keep children and adults safe in schools.”  Kanecia Zimmerman  “We studied districts that had 6 feet of distancing between students; 3 to 6 feet of distancing between students; and then less than 3 feet of distancing between students. Even on buses where there were one, two or three children to a bus seat. There were no differences between those three distinctions in distance. So this suggests we can have full in-person instruction with masking in place.”  “With masking in place, the secondary attack rate is really, really low. We can be successful. We don’t need to go back to remote education. We have tools in our toolbox in order to move forward.”  ON WHETHER QUARANTINING SCHOOL CHILDREN WORKS  Kanecia Zimmerman  “In the mask-on-mask environment, kids who are coming in contact with a positive person are having to quarantine for a substantial period of time. That means collectively in North Carolina we had more than 40,000 people who had to quarantine during the 10 to 12 weeks (of our study). More than 40,000 people is hundreds of thousands of school days that have been missed because of quarantine. And yet the benefit that we’re seeing is nil. It is very minimal transmission, therefore the risk to go to enhanced community spread really isn’t there. So we have missed school days without the benefit of actually controlling spread. This is something that I think we should think very carefully about as we move forward.”  ON MASKS AND ATHLETICS  Kanecia Zimmerman  “Athletics, particularly indoor athletics, can be a higher risk environment than the outdoor space. We need specific policies in place in order to protect athletes. Vaccination is extremely effective, as is masking.”  ON KIDS, ANXIETY AND SCHOOL THIS FALL  Danny Benjamin  “Some of the children are going to be anxious. The way we approach that kind of anxiety in our house – and we have four children – is if the adults will treat this as an adventure and if the adults will treat this as something that is fun and an opportunity, the children tend to respond better to that. For the older children, of course, the opportunity to be vaccinated right now really does provide a safe environment regardless of where the children might be. For the younger children, that’s a more nuanced discussion around what they might be seeing at school. But we know from the past 10 to 12 weeks that North Carolina is fully capable of preventing transmission at school.”  ON RESEARCH BEYOND NORTH CAROLINA  Kanecia Zimmerman  “There are data from Missouri and data from Utah where people have had 3 feet or no feet of distancing between children. They had masking mandates in place and were very successful in preventing transmission. This is in a setting of consistent testing of those exposed. The same data from Wisconsin, from Missouri … people have been extremely successful.”  ON WHETHER KIDS 12 AND OLDER SHOULD WEAR MASKS IN SCHOOL  Danny Benjamin  “We don’t have data from within North Carolina as to whether or not, in school in K-12, what happens when children are not masked. In other environments, however, if people are vaccinated, they are safe indoors. The vaccine brings the transmission down dramatically. For people who get infected, the rate of severe disease is reduced 90 to 95 percent. To give some context to this, a vaccinated child or adult … it’s safer for them indoors than it is for them to be around someone who has influenza. The vaccine is extraordinarily effective and makes life extraordinarily safe as it relates to COVID.”  ON MASK EFFECTIVENESS  Danny Benjamin  “In the mask-on-mask environment … the risk of death from acquiring COVID and dying from it in North Carolina this past year was less than the risk of riding to school in your parent’s automobile. We can effectively prevent morbidity and mortality from this disease, full stop. We have that capability.”  ON HOW TO GET KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL  Kanecia Zimmerman  “We know that if our goal is to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in schools, there are two effective ways to do that. 1: Vaccination. 2: Masking. In the setting of schools … the science suggests masking can be extremely effective, particularly for those who can’t get vaccinated while COVID-19 is still circulating.”  ON WORKING WITH POLICYMAKERS  Danny Benjamin  “It’s our privilege as a research group to partner with the state of North Carolina. It’s ultimately the policymakers of the state that make those decisions. They’ve got a lot of other things to consider other than just the findings we have in order to make the decisions that they need to make. Legislators from both sides of the aisle … and the House and the Senate, the governor’s office, DHHS, DPI, this is a state that has done an outstanding job – an outstanding job - with K-12 education as far as it relates to COVID-19. To my eye, we’ve done it better than any other state in the country. Our policymakers to date have done a phenomenal job in the toolkits and the legislation they put together that was bipartisan.”  Faculty Participants  Danny Benjamin, M.D.  Danny Benjamin, M.D., is a professor of pediatrics in the Duke School of Medicine and chair of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development’s Pediatric Trials Network.

0a68da63,"Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has worst coral die-off ever  One of the world’s treasures, the Great Barrier Reef, just suffered from its worst coral die-off ever recorded, Australian scientists announced Monday.  Record coral kill-off on Great Barrier Reef Scientists confirm a mass bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef this year has killed more corals than ever before, with more than two thirds destroyed across large swathes of the biodiverse site. Video provided by AFP Newslook  Stress from unusually warm ocean water heated by man-made climate change and the natural El Niño climate pattern caused the die-off. ""The coral was cooked,” Terry Hughes, director of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, told the BBC.  At more than 1,400 miles long, Australia's Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef and the planet's biggest structure made by living organisms. In the northernmost section of the reef, which had been considered the most ""pristine,"" some 67% of the coral died.  The good news, scientists said, was that central and southern sections of the reef fared far better, with ""only"" 6% and 1% of the coral dead, respectively.  Coral reefs result from the work of little polyps, creatures only a few millimeters long, budded on top of one another. Over centuries, the shells of these creatures combine to form the exotic shapes of coral reefs. Tiny differences in the anatomy of each polyp species affect the shape of their shells and produce the exotic shapes of each reef.  The vibrant colors that draw thousands of tourists to the Great Barrier Reef each year come from algae that live in the corals tissue. When water temperatures become too high, coral becomes stressed and expels the algae, which leave the coral a bleached white color.  Mass coral bleaching is a new phenomenon and was never observed before the 1980s as global warming ramped up.  Besides their beauty, reefs shelter land from storms, and are also a habitat for myriads of species.  ""Coral reefs are therefore the most biologically diverse ecosystems of the planet, and provide a number of ecosystem services that hundreds of millions of people rely on,"" said Greg Torda, also of the Centre, in an e-mail to USA TODAY.  ""These include provisioning (fishing, other types of harvesting, for pharmaceuticals, for example), coastal protection, aesthetic and cultural values – to name a few. If corals are lost, so are all the services they provide to humans; and so are all the species that directly or indirectly rely on them.""  Tourism on the Great Barrier Reef employs 70,000 people, and generates $5 billion (Australian) in income each year, the Centre said in a statement.  The good news is that much of the coral survived this bleaching event. But looking to the future, mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef will likely be an annual phenomenon within a decade, Torda said.  If all the coral died on the reef, “it would be among the largest mass extinction events in history,” said Torda.",Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has worst coral die-off ever,true,
47423bb6,"More than four million calls to the taxman are going unanswered, new figures show, as HM Revenue & Customs concedes the problem is almost twice as bad as previously disclosed.  More than one in 10 callers to HMRC fails to get through to anyone, compared with just over one in 20 a year ago, prompting criticism from MPs that the service is letting down millions of self-employed people.  The true scale of the problem is even worse than HMRC is prepared to admit, as its audit ignores taxpayers who get an engaged tone when they dial the tax advice helpline.  HMRC’s own figures also reveal that 14 per cent of calls took more than 10 minutes to answer, though that does not include the time people spend navigating its automated call handling service, which can add an extra four minutes to the length of a call.  In September, the month before the deadline for paper tax returns, one in five calls took more than 10 minutes to answer.  It comes despite HMRC’s claims that it has improved its performance following previous criticism of its tax advice telephone service.","Taxman fails to answer four million calls a year, as MPs warn people are not getting the help they need",true,

But the scale of the heat burst has been startling to many of the experts, and some of them fear an accelerated era of global warming could be at hand over the next few years.  Even at current temperatures, billions of tons of land ice are melting or sliding into the ocean. The sea is also absorbing most of the heat trapped by human emissions. Those factors are causing the ocean to rise at what appears to be an accelerating pace, and coastal communities in the United States are beginning to spend billions to fight increased tidal flooding. Their pleas for help from Congress have largely been ignored.  The finding that a record had been set for the third year in a row was released on Wednesday by three government agencies, two of them American and one British, that track measurements made by ships, buoys and land-based weather stations. They analyze the figures to correct for known problems, producing an annual average temperature for the surface of the Earth. The national meteorological agency of Japan confirmed the findings in a preliminary analysis.  In the British data set, 2016 set a record by only a small amount; the margin was larger in the NOAA data set and larger still in NASA’s. NASA does more work than the other groups to take full account of Arctic temperatures, and several scientists said they believed the NASA record to be the most accurate for 2016 for that reason.",Earth Sets a Temperature Record for the Third Straight Year,true,
c32f210d,"Story highlights It's a key indicator of climate change and can mean changes to weather  Temperatures are 30 degrees above normal at the North Pole  (CNN) For what appears to be the first time since scientists began keeping track, sea ice in the Arctic and the Antarctic are at record lows this time of year.  ""It looks like, since the beginning of October, that for the first time we are seeing both the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice running at record low levels,"" said Walt Meier, a research scientist with the Cryospheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, who has tracked sea ice data going back to 1979.  While record low sea ice is nothing new in the Arctic, this is a surprising turn of events for the Antarctic. Even as sea ice in the Arctic has seen a rapid and consistent decline over the past decade, its counterpart in the Southern Hemisphere has seen its extent increasing.  In fact, each year from 2012 through 2014 reached a record high for Antarctic sea ice extent. Skeptics have long pointed to ice gain in the Southern Hemisphere as evidence climate change wasn't occurring, but scientists warned that it was caused by natural variations and circulations in the atmosphere.  While it is too early to know if the recent, rapid decline in Antarctic sea ice is going to be a regular occurrence like in the Arctic, it ""certainly puts the kibosh on everyone saying that Antarctica's ice is just going up and up,"" Meier said.

,"Israel was way ahead of the rest of the world when it came to COVID vaccination, so it’s not surprising that data from this corner of the Mediterranean causes a lot of excitement – it’s a glimpse into the future.  Indeed, this happened recently when researchers at Maccabi Healthcare Services in Tel Aviv released a preprint (a study that is yet to be reviewed by other experts) suggesting people who had been infected with COVID had greater protection than vaccinated people against becoming reinfected with the delta variant. Unfortunately, some took this to mean that getting COVID is a better idea than getting vaccinated.  First, the possibility that a COVID infection leads to longer-lived immunity than vaccination is not far-fetched. Infection exposes our immune system to several viral proteins, whereas the most commonly used COVID vaccines introduce a single antigen: the spike protein. This results in a more directed but also a more restricted immune response than after infection.  Although people who have had COVID can get reinfected, naturally acquired immunity continues to evolve over time and antibodies remain detectable for longer than was first anticipated. New evidence suggests that immunity following both severe and mild infection protects against both symptomatic and asymptomatic reinfection.  However, apart from the danger of drawing conclusions from data that other scientists have not yet reviewed, it is also crucial to put the data in the right context. Although the study draws attention to the potency of naturally acquired immunity, it does not consider the risks involved in achieving natural immunity through infection. Nor does it cast a shadow on vaccine-generated immunity.  In fact, the benefit of vaccination is not even addressed in the study since unvaccinated people without prior infection were not included for comparison. The low rate of COVID-related hospitalisations among vaccinated participants (eight out of 16,000) would probably be strikingly lower than among non-vaccinated people without prior infection, but this group was not included in the analyses.  A common reason to remain unvaccinated is the misconception that waiting for natural immunity by choosing infection over vaccination is an option. But infection-acquired immunity may come at a heavy cost.  Indeed, apart from the overt risks of severe illness or death, several recent studies show that otherwise healthy people who have recovered from COVID have a substantially increased risk of longer-term serious health problems, including myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), blood clots and stroke, compared to vaccinated people. And the most rigorous safety monitoring in US history has shown that COVID vaccines are safe and effective.  With cases surging globally and deaths driven by the delta variant, waiting for infection – and risking long-term health problems, severe illness and death – to achieve immunity to the very same infection is as fruitless as it is dangerous.  Hybrid immunity  The Israeli preprint does, however, shed light on our increasing understanding of the potent immunity induced by getting the vaccine after having COVID – so-called hybrid immunity. Several studies show a substantial boost in both antibody and T-cell responses to vaccine in people with previous COVID infection.  A recent report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that people who’d recovered from COVID and were later vaccinated had half the risk of reinfection compared with unvaccinated people who’d previously had COVID. So it’s still worth getting the vaccine, even if you have previously had COVID.  The effective immune booster following the combination of natural immunity and a single subsequent vaccine jab also raises the question of whether one dose is enough for people who have had COVID. Several studies report that immune responses to a single dose of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine exceed those after two doses in people without prior infection.  Several countries, such as France, Italy and Germany, therefore now recommend a single dose for people with a previous COVID infection. And infection without vaccination is recognised as immunity for the current Israeli green pass rules.  Although directing boosters to people who have not been infected may make the most of limited vaccine supplies, personalised schedules and exemptions from vaccine mandates may be logistically tricky in the midst of a pandemic. Antibody screening before vaccination is time-consuming and expensive, and it introduces practical challenges in identifying those who have or haven’t previously had COVID. These exemptions could slow vaccine rollout rather than speed it up.  As unprecedented research efforts deliver knowledge about our immune responses to COVID infection and vaccination on a daily basis, we must critically view the data together with all the facts that relate to it. We are far from bringing the pandemic to an end, and the potential risks of being infected are unquestionable. Our priority should be to slow transmission and get vaccines to those who remain unvaccinated and need them the most. To avoid vaccination, wait for infection and hope for natural immunity makes little sense.",COVID infections may give more potent immunity than vaccines – but that doesn’t mean you should try to catch it,true,325319004916346934877291509512924943833
,"Campaigners say people from Caribbean countries such as Jamaica appear to be disproportionately targeted for deportation from the UK if they commit crimes, according to Home Office data obtained by the Guardian following a yearlong freedom of information battle.  One pressure group said the high percentage of Jamaican nationals deported was particularly glaring given their greater likelihood of having family ties in the UK, and warned that it could further erode the trust of people affected by the Windrush scandal.  Nationals from Ghana and Nigeria are also removed significantly more often than the overall average, the figures show. Another set of controversial Home Office chartered deportation flights to both countries are expected next month.  Campaigners also expressed alarm after the statistics showed particularly high levels of people deported to Albania and Vietnam, which have notable issues with human trafficking connected to organised crime.  Under the UK Borders Act 2007, foreign nationals who are jailed for a single offence for at least 12 months will normally be considered for deportation on their release, with exceptions under human rights rules – for example, having children in the UK, and for people who have been trafficked.  A comparison of Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and Home Office data between 2015 and 2020 showed that once people from European Economic Area countries were excluded, as they are not covered by the act, an average of 65% of overseas nationals jailed for at least 12 months were deported.  For Jamaican nationals, this proportion rose to 75%, however, despite the much greater likelihood of their having significant ties to the UK. For other former British colonies in the Caribbean, such as Trinidad and Tobago, and St Lucia, the rates were higher still.  The statistics also showed that 90% of Nigerian nationals were deported, and 76% of those from Ghana. For Albanians, the rate was 90%, and for Vietnamese nationals 84%.  Both sets of data were obtained under freedom of information laws. While the MoJ supplied the information within weeks, the Home Office refused, saying that to do so would be “likely to prejudice diplomatic relations between the UK and a foreign government”, and could hamper the operation of immigration controls.  The Guardian appealed to the Information Commissioner’s Office, which ruled against the Home Office, calling the department’s arguments “vague” and “generic”, and noting that no attempt had been made to substantiate them. “The commissioner will not accept at face value assertions made by a public authority that, in her view, require a proper and fuller explanation,” the ruling stated.  Bishop Desmond Jaddoo, chair of the Windrush National Organisation, said he was dispirited but not surprised by the statistics. “This bears out what we’ve been saying for a very long time – that particularly Jamaicans have disproportionately fallen foul of immigration regulations,” he said.  “I believe the British government are disregarding family lives. I understand people have committed crimes, but they are being punished twice – they have served their time in prison, many have gone back to their families and children, some have spent years out of prison, and then they’re deported.”  Jaddoo said the disproportionality risked further alienating people from Windrush communities: “We’re talking here about trust and confidence, about people being able to come forward. People are still worried.”  Bella Sankey, the director of Detention Action, which campaigns over deportation flights, said: “The Home Office claims its deportation system is not discriminatory, but these statistics reveal the truth. As we’ve long suspected, black-majority, former British colonies like Nigeria, Ghana and Jamaica are targeted, along with countries where trafficking is prevalent, like Albania and Vietnam.  “How are these decisions made? Are these the easy targets for a department that cares little for black lives and trafficking survivors?”  Deportations, particularly to Jamaica, have become an increasingly contentious issue in recent months. Some of those removed have lived in the UK since they were children. Under a deal agreed late last year between the UK and Jamaica, the Home Office will no longer remove Jamaican nationals who first moved to the UK before the age of 12.  A Home Office spokesperson said: “The public rightly expects us to remove those who have no right to be in the UK, including dangerous foreign criminals. These figures show the ongoing work to remove those who have received at least a 12-month sentence in the UK for committing crimes such as sexual offences, drug dealing and arson.  “We regularly operate charter flights, but also use other available routes such as regularly scheduled flights to remove criminals from the UK – we do not target specific countries. Returns, including deportations as well as voluntary departures, to Jamaica constituted less than 1% of all returns between January 2015 and March 2020.”  The headline and text of this article were amended on 24 August 2021 to make clear that the claim of disproportionate “targeting” has been made by campaigners.","Disproportionate ‘targeting’ of Jamaicans for deportation from UK, data suggests",true,264800977996672429377733770120049387899
1a6a1a97,"The number of children being considered for adoption has plummeted by 24 per cent in a year, despite an increase in those taken into care, official figures show. Adoption placement orders, which mean children are ruled eligible to be adopted, fell to just 7,320 between March 2014 and March 2015, according to the Department for Education’s latest Looked After Children statistics. Those placed for adoption also fell by 15 per cent in 2015 to 3,320. 69,540 The total number of looked after children in the UK up to March 2015 The fall comes as more children are being taken into care than at any time since 1986. At the end of March this year there were 69,540 looked after children, an increase of 6 per cent compared to 31 March 2011. The majority of these children live in foster care. Javed Khan, chief executive of Barnardo’s, said: “We are deeply concerned about the drastic 24 per cent fall in the number of children being put forward for adoption. It’s crucial that local authorities don’t shy away from acting decisively. These can be tough decisions but the best interests of vulnerable children must be put first. This could very soon become a real crisis with children waiting an unnecessary length of time in care – or even missing out completely on the chance of their own loving, safe and supportive family.” Earlier this year The Independent revealed how a series of rulings in the family courts had sent adoption rates into freefall. The problems began in November 2013 when the President of the Family Court, Sir James Munby, made a ruling that left many local authorities convinced they must try every extended family member before putting a child up for adoption. Two further rulings in January slowed down the process further. Sir James granted an appeal in a case in Liverpool where three children were taken away from a mother with a history of drug and alcohol abuse who was given no opportunity to prepare a case. He ruled that the “ruthlessly truncated process” employed by the earlier judge in the case was “unprincipled and unfair”. A second case decided by Mr Justice Keehan ruled that Northamptonshire County Council had made “egregious failures” in its handling of the case of a baby taken into care without proper assessments of the mother or the maternal grandparents in Latvia, where the baby was eventually placed. Data released for the first time this year also showed that more than 6,000 children went missing from care in the year to March 2015.

,"Washington (CNN) A large gun-rights rally in Virginia's state capital unfolded peacefully Monday despite earlier fears of the kind of violence that took place in nearby Charlottesville three years ago.  Security was tight as gun-rights advocates descended on Richmond for ""Lobby Day"" to oppose legislation that would restrict access to firearms in the state. The commonwealth braced for the potential of extremist and white nationalist groups to disrupt the peaceful demonstrations with violence and riots, and the state's Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, declared a temporary state of emergency last week to ban open and concealed firearms and other weapons from the state capitol grounds.  The crowd, however, was peaceful, with no immediate reports of violence. One person was arrested with one felony count of wearing a mask in public. A 21-year-old woman was arrested and charged after having been warned two times not to wear a bandana over her face and then arrested when an officer saw her wearing it a third time, police said.  Some streets surrounding the capitol grounds, several of which were closed ahead of the event, were packed with protesters. About 22,000 people attended the rally, according to the Virginia Division of Capitol Police. That includes about 6,000 people in the official rally area and 16,000 outside.  Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, welcomed the fact that the day passed without serious incident.  ""Thousands of people came to Richmond to make their voices heard. Today showed that when people disagree, they can do so peacefully,"" Northam said in a statement. ""The issues before us evoke strong emotions, and progress is often difficult. I will continue to listen to the voices of Virginians, and I will continue to do everything in my power to keep our Commonwealth safe.""  In addition to the people on the capitol grounds, there was a large group outside the fenced area, which was not under the ban on weapons and is an open carry area. They were chanting ""Northam out"" and outnumbered the group on the capitol grounds. There was a heavy police presence among this crowd, and law enforcement could also be seen on the rooftops, providing extra security to the area.  Several protesters brandished rifles and held signs extolling gun rights.  ""We came unarmed ... this time,"" one read. ""Patriots unite! They ban, we fight,"" read another.

Manny Vega of Richmond, who was outside the secured area, said he and his fellow protesters were ""here to represent every citizen here that wants to keep the right to bear arms.""  Speakers at the event concluded their remarks around noon, and crowds began dispersing shortly afterwards.  Concerns about threats  JUST WATCHED Virginia governor declares temporary state of emergency Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Virginia governor declares temporary state of emergency 01:33  People began lining up around 6 a.m. ET to go through security, an hour before gates to the capitol grounds were opened. Security was very thorough, as officers went through bags and made people remove their jackets to be searched despite the frigid temperatures. Law enforcement confiscated items like lighters as people passed into the secured area.  State Capitol Police urged attendees on social media that if they ""SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING,"" and posted a list of prohibited items.  Despite fears of potential violence, President Donald Trump urged his followers to stand up to state Democrats' gun control efforts.  ""The Democrat Party in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia are working hard to take away your 2nd Amendment rights,"" Trump tweeted late Monday morning. ""This is just the beginning. Don't let it happen, VOTE REPUBLICAN in 2020!  According to Northam, law enforcement had learned of credible threats of violence surrounding Monday's rally, made from mainstream and alternative dark web channels used by violent groups and white nationalists outside of Virginia.  That led the Democratic governor to issue a temporary state of emergency last week through Tuesday, banning open and concealed firearms and other weapons from the state capitol grounds.  When announcing the ban on Wednesday, Northam said he hoped to prevent incidents like the violence that erupted three years ago at the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, which left one counter protester dead and several others injured.  On Thursday, the FBI arrested three alleged members of a white supremacist group, including two men accused of possessing a machine gun, over 1,000 rounds of ammunition and body armor parts.  Sean Restatter, 22, told CNN on the capitol grounds Monday that the protest was intended to be peaceful.  ""There might be far-right and far-left groups that might be out here today, but the vast majority of the message is 'guns save lives' and we believe in the 2nd Amendment,"" he said.  Right to gun ownership for 'law abiding citizens'  The gun rights group -- the Virginia Citizens Defense League -- who organized protests on so-called Lobby Day said their demonstrations would be peaceful and intended to draw attention to "" Second Amendment sanctuaries ,"" or what they refer to as localities that vow not to enforce ""unconstitutional"" gun laws.  One of the speakers invited by VCDL included Stephen Willeford , the man who shot and chased the shooter in the Sutherland Springs, Texas, church massacre in 2017.  The group's president, Philip Van Cleave, previously told CNN that they've been attending Lobby Day since 2003 to advocate for guns rights by ""law abiding citizens,"" and the ""grassroots"" effort hasn't had any incidents of violence.  Northam's executive order was quickly challenged in court by VCDL, the Gun Owners of America and three private individuals, who argued that the ban violated their rights under the First and Second Amendments. A judge upheld the governor's temporary ban on Thursday, leading them to file an appeal with Virginia's Supreme Court. On Friday, the Supreme Court of Virginia refused their petition, leaving Northam's ban in effect.  But since winning control of the state legislature in November, Democrats have more successfully advanced gun control measures in the 2020 legislative session.  The Virginia Senate, along party lines, approved several gun measures last week, including background checks for private firearm transfers, limiting gun purchases to one handgun a month and allowing localities to ban firearms in public during a permitted event.  The bills now head to the Virginia House of Delegates.

,"A common reason cited for not getting vaccinated against COVID-19—especially among the young and healthy—is ""I trust my immune system"" or some variation of that line. The same goes for those who have already had the virus and assume they've developed some natural immunity.  Though the human immune system is indeed an extraordinary mechanism, it's not worth gambling with a disease as unpredictable and serious as COVID-19, says infectious disease expert Anna Durbin, a professor of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.  ""It's Russian roulette,"" she says. ""Young people tend to think they're invincible. But it just takes that one slip and your entire life could change.""  With the delta variant, we're seeing many more young people on ventilators in hospitals and dying, Durbin says. And declining the vaccine is more than just a personal decision: An infected person can easily transmit the virus to others, including immunocompromised people at higher risk for grave illness and children under 12 who can't yet access the vaccines.  During a conversation with the Hub, Durbin, a faculty member at the Center for Immunization Research, talked about some of the popular misconceptions surrounding natural immunity and the purpose of vaccines.  What would you say to someone who wants to put their faith in their own immune system with COVID-19?  It's not a good idea. Yes, natural infection does provide some immunity, so the next time you get that disease, you won't get as sick. But here's the problem: Your first encounter with that disease could go very wrong. With COVID-19, you could end up very ill, you could end up in the hospital, or you could die. We're seeing huge rates of hospitalizations and deaths, and you don't want to risk becoming one of those statistics. And there are other potential complications: You could lose your sense of taste and smell for months, you could develop long-haul COVID-19. It's an unpredictable disease, and we don't know how it's going to hit different people.  That's where the vaccines come in. Vaccines provide protection without any of the morbidities you can get with a natural COVID-19 protection. We don't have vaccines for things like the common cold because most people don't get very sick from that, so it's not worth the effort to make different vaccines for every different cold virus. But when we see viruses or other bacteria that can cause severe illness, like COVID-19, we need the protection of a vaccine to prevent the hospitalizations and deaths. Vaccines are the reason we no longer see so many other diseases that people suffered from in the past: smallpox, measles, polio, even chicken pox.  For those who have already had COVID-19 in the past, why would a vaccine still be necessary?  The vaccines still lower your risks. We have evidence showing that if you've been naturally infected with COVID-19 and you aren't vaccinated, your risk of getting reinfected with symptomatic disease is about 2.5–fold higher. When you introduce the vaccine to someone who's already had COVID-19, the body says, ""Hey, I remember that, I'm going to stimulate the immune response so you're protected."" You're pumping up your antibodies to higher levels so they can stop the virus before it enters your system.  Anna Durbin Professor, Bloomberg School of Public Health and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine ""We're seeing some breakthrough infections among vaccinated people and will continue to, but that's expected and doesn't mean the vaccines are failing.""  So would someone who's had both COVID-19 and the vaccine have the most protection possible?  There's no doubt that natural infection confers immunity, and we're seeing some evidence—not surprising—that a previous COVID-19 infection plus vaccination provides more durable protection than simply vaccines alone. But that doesn't mean that vaccinated people should go out there and try to get infected. That risk just isn't worth taking as people, even young healthy people, can get very, very sick. We want to simply stop infections from happening, full-stop, to get this virus under control and prevent it from mutating further.  What if the response to that is ""vaccinated people can transmit the virus, too,"" a fact now confirmed?  They can, but we have evidence showing that vaccinated people are less likely to both get infected and to transmit the virus, and may spread the virus for a shorter time.  Are antibody tests a reliable way for someone to assess their immunity to COVID-19?  There are a couple things that are flawed about that. First, antibody levels wane over time; that happens naturally. Second, these tests don't capture the full picture. Antibodies are just one part of the equation. They're not primarily responsible for preventing severe disease once you're infected—that's the job of your memory immune response, which remembers the pathogen it saw before and gears up to control infection. Then there's the whole other arm of your immune system called T-cells, whose job is to recognize the virus in your body, identify cells infected with the virus, and destroy those cells.  The antibody tests are designed to diagnose whether you've had the infection recently. They're not designed to tell you how your immune system is going to respond to COVID-19, or how well your vaccines are going to work.  What other misconceptions about immunity do you want to clear up?  I want people to understand that vaccination-induced immunity, like natural immunity, doesn't necessarily protect you from getting infected with COVID-19. The purpose of vaccinations is to prevent severe illness and death. So, yes, we're seeing some breakthrough infections among vaccinated people and will continue to, but that's expected and doesn't mean the vaccines are failing. Even with the delta variant, this is a success story because we're seeing vaccines for the most part do what they need to do.  Also, this topic of booster shots I think is a bit of a distraction right now. There's this idea out there that your immunity suddenly falls off a cliff at six or eight months. That's not what's happening. You still have that memory immune response, and that's why we're still seeing effectiveness against the delta variant.  The other thing I need to stress is that booster shots aren't going to stop delta. The only way we can do that is to have unvaccinated people get their initial vaccinations. That's the only way we're going to control not only delta but the emergence of other variants that could prolong or worsen this pandemic.",Vaccines beat natural immunity in fight against COVID-19,true,110822399338211793293151321772553974668
,"The name of the 21-year-old suspect, who is in custody, was released at a news conference by Boulder Police Chief Maris Herold, who did not disclose a possible motive for Monday's bloodshed.  A search of the suspect's suburban Denver home turned up other weapons, a senior law enforcement source said Tuesday. The weapon used in the attack was an AR-15-style pistol modified with an arm brace, according to the source.  Authorities have said they believe Alissa was the only person involved and that there was no additional threat to the community.  The suspect has been charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and one charge of attempted murder, according to his arrest warrant. His first court appearance is scheduled for 8:15 a.m. (10:15 a.m. ET) Thursday, according to Colorado Judicial Branch online records.  The warrant described Alissa as being armed with either an assault rifle or ""black AR-15"" and wearing a ""tactical"" or ""armored"" vest. A senior law enforcement source told CNN on condition of anonymity the shooter used a Ruger AR-556 pistol, modified with an arm brace, and was also carrying a 9 mm handgun, according to the source.  The Boulder Police Department released the booking photograph of suspected gunman Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa.  The suspect had ""removed all of his clothing and was dressed only in shorts"" when he was taken into custody, the affidavit said. Outside the store, the document said, Alissa wouldn't tell police whether there were other suspects, but he did ask to speak to his mother.  Using law enforcement databases, the affidavit said, investigators determined Alissa had purchased a Ruger AR556 pistol on March 16.A law enforcement official told CNN Alissa was not previously the subject of any FBI investigation and said it appears nothing in the federal system would have prohibited Alissa from buying a firearm.  Michael Dougherty, Boulder County district attorney, said Alissa is a resident of Arvada, between Boulder and Denver, who has ""lived most of his life in the United States.""  Brother says he believes suspect was 'paranoid'  Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa was taken into custody after the mass shooting.  Alissa, whose family emigrated from Syria, may have been suffering from mental illness, according to his 34-year-old brother, Ali Aliwi Alissa.  The brother told CNN on Tuesday that in high school bullies made fun of Alissa's name and for being Muslim and that may have contributed to him becoming ""anti-social.""  ""People chose not to mess with him because of his temper, people chose not to really talk to him because of all -- how he acted and things like that. So yeah, he was very alone,"" said Damien Cruz, who said he has known Alissa since the fifth grade.  Alissa had become increasingly ""paranoid"" around 2014, believing he was being followed and chased, according to his brother. At one point, the young man covered the camera on his computer with duct tape so he could not be seen, said the brother, who lives with Alissa.  ""He always suspected someone was behind him, someone was chasing him,"" Ali Alissa said.  ""We kept a close eye on him when he was in high school. He would say, 'Someone is chasing me, someone is investigating me.' And we're like, 'Come on man. There's nothing.' ... He was just closing into himself,"" the brother added.  Alissa's Facebook page, the authenticity of which was confirmed by his brother and a high school classmate, shows posts saying he believed his former high school had been hacking into his phone.  ""Just curious what are the laws about phone privacy because I believe my old school (a west) was hacking my phone,"" Alissa wrote in a March 18, 2019, Facebook post.  He made a second post on July 5, 2019, also claiming that people were hacking his phone, saying, ""let me have a normal life I probably could.""  When his Facebook friends questioned how he knew the school was hacking his phone, Alissa said: ""I believe part racism for sure. But I also believe someone spread rumors about me which are false and maybe that set it off.""  The profile claims Alissa attended Arvada West High School. Cameron Bell, Jefferson County Public Schools spokesperson, confirmed Alissa was a student there from March 2015 until he graduated in May 2018.  Alissa was not very political or particularly religious, according to his brother, who said he never heard the young man threaten to use violence.  ""The entire thing surprised me,"" Ali Alissa said of the Monday's shootings. ""I never ever would have thought he would do such a thing. I never thought he would kill. I still can't believe it. I am really sad for the lives that he wasted, and I feel sorry for all those families. ... We lost a brother even if he is the killer.""  Aside from a knife he used for cooking, Ali Alissa said he did not know his brother to carry any weapon, including a firearm.  Sister-in-law says she saw suspect playing with a gun  According to the arrest warrant, a woman identified as the suspect's sister-in-law ""stated that (Ahmad Al Aliwi) Alissa was seen playing with a gun she thought looked like a 'machine gun' about 2 days ago. She did not believe the gun looked like the rifles she has seen in old Western movies. . . . Alissa had been talking about having a bullet stuck in the gun and was playing with the gun.""  The woman's name was redacted from the document.  Ali Alissa said he doesn't know why his brother went to King Soopers on Monday. Police interrogated him and another brother, according to Ali Alissa, who said authorities searched their home in the predawn hours Tuesday.  ""They searched every corner,"" he said, ""every piece of clothing.""  The family emigrated from Syria in 2002, the brother said. They have lived in the Arvada area since 2014.  Facebook has shut down Facebook and Instagram accounts belonging to the suspect, a company spokesperson said Tuesday.  Alissa was found guilty of assault in 2018  Alissa was sentenced to one year probation and 48 hours of community service after being found guilty of third-degree assault in 2018 for an incident that occurred the previous November, according to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation's database.  The case stemmed from a incident in which a then-18-year-old Alissa was accused of attacking a classmate at Arvada West High School.  A report from a police officer included in the case file says Alissa ""got up in (a) classroom, walked over to (the) victim & 'cold-cocked' him in the head.""  Alissa ""got on top of (the victim) & punched him in (the) head several more times,"" the report says, adding that the victim ""had bruising, swelling & cuts to (the) head, as well as pain.""  ""No witnesses could see or hear any reason"" for the attack, and Alissa said the victim ""had made fun of him & called him racial names weeks earlier,"" the officer wrote.  Shooting comes 1 week after Atlanta massacre  The mass shooting suspect has made statements to investigators, Dougherty said.  ""We're collecting those statements now and we'll be providing those in the weeks ahead,"" Dougherty said.  Herold said the suspect was wounded in the leg during ""an exchange of gunfire.""  The suspect was taken into custody about 3:30 p.m. Monday and transported to a hospital, where he was in stable condition.  He was booked into Boulder County Jail early Tuesday afternoon, according to the jail's records.  The massacre at the King Soopers store occurred less than a week after shootings at three spas in the Atlanta area left eight people dead. In the past week in the US, there have been at least seven shootings in which at least four people were injured or killed.  The slain Boulder officer, 51-year-old Eric Talley, was the first to respond to the scene, according to Herold. Talley had joined the force in 2010, she said.  The victims were ordinary Coloradans going about their daily lives -- picking up groceries, waiting in line for a coronavirus vaccine. They ranged from 20 to 65 years old.","Here's what we know about the Boulder, Colorado, mass shooting suspect",true,226133042788852825560927222478720705754
,"Last week Johnson gave his strongest hint yet that the final stage of easing restrictions, originally set for June 21, might be delayed  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday announced a four-week delay to the full lifting of coronavirus restrictions in England due to a surge in infections caused by the Delta variant.  The delay comes as a blow to Johnson's plans to fully reopen the UK economy on June 21 after months of gradually easing restrictions since March.  Newspapers had been counting down to what had been dubbed ""Freedom Day"", which was set to mark an end to all social distancing restrictions and the reopening of nightclubs.  But Johnson said a sharp rise in infections had prompted a decision to ""ease off the accelerator"" and focus instead on ramping up vaccinations.  ""On the evidence I can see right now, I'm confident that we will not need more than four weeks and won't need to go beyond July 19,"" Johnson told a press briefing.  Health policy is devolved in the four nations that make up the UK, handled separately in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Scotland, which was due to move to the lowest level of restrictions on June 28, is also expected to announce a delay to its reopening.  In England, most current rules -- including limits on the number of people who can meet in pubs and restaurants -- will remain in place until July 19, although restrictions on the number of guests allowed at weddings will be lifted.  Large scale pilot events, such as Euro 2020 football matches, will also go ahead as planned.  The more transmissible Delta variant, first identified in India, is now responsible for 96 percent of UK cases, and positive tests have jumped 50 percent in the last week.  Total reported cases are now at their highest since February -- around 8,000 new infections a day.  The Delta variant is believed to be around 60 percent more transmissible than the Alpha variant first identified in Kent, southeast England.  That strain forced the country to go into another three-month lockdown in January.  Nevertheless hospital admissions and deaths remain low, thanks in large part to Britain's rapid vaccination rollout.  Story continues  More than 55 percent of adults in the UK have had two vaccine jabs.  - Vaccine boost -  Newspapers have hinted at dissent within Johnson's cabinet over the delay, with The Times citing an unnamed minister as saying it was ""a very odd decision"".  Johnson accepted that ""we cannot simply eliminate Covid, we must learn to live with it,"" but added that ""once the adults of this country have been overwhelmingly vaccinated... we will be in a far stronger position to... live with this disease"".  The government hopes that two thirds of all adults will have received two shots by July 19.  A study released Monday found that two jabs of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine stopped the need for in-patient treatment in 96 percent of cases of the new variant.  With a double dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca shot, the rate was 92 percent.  The government had hoped to allow crowds to return unrestricted to pubs and clubs next week, with the hard-hit hospitality industry warning it is on its last legs.  Trade association UKHospitality estimated that a month's delay in lifting the restrictions would cost the sector around £3 billion ($4.23 billion) in sales.  ""A full and final ending of restrictions is the only way to ensure that businesses in this sector can trade profitably,"" said its chief executive Kate Nicholls.  imm-am/jwp/kjl",England delays full lifting of virus restrictions,true,66652437025393751341725471806242230214
,"The persistent march of a warming climate is seen across a multitude of continuous, incremental changes. CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Ocean heat content. Global sea level rise. Each creeps up year after year, fuelled by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.  And while climate records are being routinely broken, the cumulative impact of these changes could also cause fundamental parts of the Earth system to change dramatically and irreversibly.  These “tipping points” are thresholds where a tiny change could push a system into a completely new state.  Imagine a child pushing themselves from the top of a playground slide. There is a point beyond which it is too late for the child to stop themselves sliding down. Pass this threshold and the child continues inevitably towards a different state – at the bottom of the slide rather than the top.  In this article, Carbon Brief explores nine key tipping points across the Earth system, from collapsing ice sheets and thawing permafrost, to shifting monsoons and forest dieback.  Along with this explainer, Carbon Brief has published guest articles from experts in four of the tipping points covered here.  Tipping towers  A glance at the news media on any given week will likely highlight all sorts of climate change impacts. From declining Arctic sea ice and record-breaking heatwaves to melting glaciers and worsening droughts, the increase in global average temperature is being felt around the world.  Broadly, these impacts reflect gradual changes caused by a climate that is steadily warming. Scientists have estimated, for example, that for every tonne of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere, summer sea ice cover in the Arctic shrinks by three square metres.  However, there are parts of the Earth system that have the potential to change abruptly in response to warming. These systems have “tipping points”, explains Prof Tim Lenton, director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter. He tells Carbon Brief:  “A climate tipping point, or any tipping point in any complex system, is where a small change makes a big difference and changes the state or the fate of a system.”  So, rather than a bit more warming causing slightly hotter heatwaves or more melting of glaciers, it causes a dramatic shift to an entire system.  That extra bit of warming would be, as the saying goes, the straw that breaks the camel’s back. Or, to use a more animal-friendly metaphor, a game of Jenga – where a particular component within the Earth system, such as an ice sheet, circulation pattern or ecosystem, is represented by the tower of blocks.  Animation by Tom Prater for Carbon Brief.  The gradual increase in global temperature sees block after block removed from the tower and placed on top. As time goes on, the tower becomes more and more misshapen and unstable. At some point, the tower can no longer support itself and it tips over.  In the game of Jenga, the tower collapses in a split second. For a component of the Earth system, the shift to one physical state to another may take many decades or centuries. But the feature they have in common is that once the collapse has started, it is virtually impossible to stop.  It is worth noting that a tipping point can be caused by natural fluctuations in the climate as well as by an external forcing, such as global warming. These are called “noise-induced” tipping points and include, for example, periods of abrupt change during the last ice age called “Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events”.  Natural fluctuations can also be the final nudge for a tipping point pushed to the brink by human-caused climate change, says Prof Mat Collins, joint Met Office chair in climate change at the University of Exeter and coordinating lead author on the “Extremes, Abrupt Changes and Managing Risks” chapter of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate (“SROCC”). He tells Carbon Brief:  “As you approach the edge of the cliff, a small random gust of wind is more likely to blow you over the edge. This is more prevalent in biological systems. A strong marine heatwave in one year can wipe out a large coral ecosystem for many decades – or, perhaps, even permanently. The heatwave is a result of natural fluctuations, but becomes more likely and more extreme with an increasing average trend.”  Back to top  Irreversible change?  The theory of potentially abrupt changes in the Earth system is not new. In a Nature commentary in 1987, for example, Prof Wally Broecker of Columbia University – who died in 2019 – warned that palaeoclimate data suggests the “Earth’s climate does not respond to forcing in a smooth and gradual way. Rather, it responds in sharp jumps which involve large-scale reorganisation of Earth’s system”.  The term “tipping point” itself was popularised by journalist and author Malcolm Gladwell in his book of the same name, published in 2000. Gladwell describes tipping points as “the moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point”, and explores examples throughout human society:  “There was a tipping point for [declining] violent crime in New York in the early 1990s, and a tipping point for the reemergence of Hush Puppies, just as there is a tipping point for the introduction of any new technology.”  In the years since, the term has been used increasingly in scientific circles. However, this has not been without controversy. There are, for example, many different views on how the term should be defined and used, explains Collins:  “There has been an intensive debate in the field of tipping points, abrupt change and irreversibility about the definitions of these terms. They range from the very mathematical to those which are intended to be understood by policymakers.”  According to a 2009 paper on the use of the term “tipping points” in climate science and the media, a presentation (pdf) in 2005 by Dr James Hansen of Columbia University’s Earth Institute helped “initiate a tipping point trend in climate change communication that was quickly reflected in public debate”.  In Hansen’s talk – a tribute to scientist Prof Charles Keeling, given at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting – Hansen warned that “we are on the precipice of climate system tipping points beyond which there is no redemption”.  By its Fall Meeting of 2008, the AGU had an entire half-day session dedicated to climate tipping points. A Science briefing about the meeting declared that “tipping points, once considered too alarmist for proper scientific circles, have entered the climate change mainstream”.  A year earlier, the IPCC had published its fourth assessment report (“AR4”, pdf). This was the first of its assessment reports to use the term “tipping point” – though the third assessment report (“TAR”, pdf) in 2001 had discussed “large-scale discontinuities” that have the “potential to trigger large-scale changes in Earth systems”. Indeed, speaking to a journalist at the time, chapter lead author Prof Hans Joachim Schellnhuber explained that “these are, more or less, tipping points”.  AR4 adopted a definition of a tipping point based on a 2002 report led by Penn State scientist Prof Richard Alley for the US National Research Council. It states:  “Technically, an abrupt climate change occurs when the climate system is forced to cross some threshold, triggering a transition to a new state at a rate determined by the climate system itself and faster than the cause.”  The IPCC’s definition in its fifth assessment report (“AR5”, pdf), published in 2013-14, gives more detail:  “We define abrupt climate change as a large-scale change in the climate system that takes place over a few decades or less, persists (or is anticipated to persist) for at least a few decades, and causes substantial disruptions in human and natural systems.”  Typically, definitions for a tipping point fall into two categories, says Dr Ricarda Winkelmann, junior professor of climate system analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). She explains to Carbon Brief:  “One is simply that one vital part of the climate system shows some kind of threshold behaviour and that means that a small perturbation around that element can cause a huge qualitative change. And then there’s another definition that actually says there needs to be a positive feedback mechanism associated with the element. So that means there is something that’s self-reinforcing and then that could lead to irreversible changes as well.”  Passing an irreversible tipping point would mean a system would not revert to its original state even if the forcing lessens or reverses, explains Dr Richard Wood, who leads the Climate, Cryosphere and Oceans group in the Met Office Hadley Centre. He tells Carbon Brief:  “In some cases, there is evidence that once the system has jumped to a different state, then if you remove the climate forcing, the climate system doesn’t just jump back to the original state – it stays in its changed state for some considerable time, or possibly even permanently.”  This is known as “hysteresis”. It occurs when a system undergoes a “bifurcation” – which means to divide or fork into two branches – and it is subsequently difficult, if not impossible, for the system to revert to its previous state.  For example, part of the reason that Greenland has an ice sheet today is that it has had that ice sheet for hundreds of thousands of years. If the Greenland ice sheet were to pass a tipping point that led to its disintegration, simply reducing emissions and lowering global temperatures to pre-industrial levels would not bring it back again. It would probably require another ice age to achieve that.  Similarly, returning to the Jenga analogy, the amount of energy required to rebuild the tower once it collapsed is significantly greater than the energy used to tip it over.  The extent to which the tipping points considered in this article are irreversible is just one of the many uncertainties that researchers are still exploring. Nonetheless, each of the nine – explained below – are examples of where seemingly small changes have the collective potential to pack a potent punch.  Back to top  Shutdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation  The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a system of currents in the Atlantic Ocean that brings warm water up to Europe from the tropics and beyond.  The illustration below shows the two main features of the AMOC: the first is the flow of warm, salty water in the upper layers of the ocean northwards from the Gulf of Mexico (red line). This is made up of the “Gulf Stream” to the south and the “North Atlantic Current” further north. The second is the cooling of water in the high latitudes of the Atlantic, which makes the water more dense. This denser water then sinks and returns southwards towards the equator at much deeper depths (blue line).  The AMOC forms part of a wider network of global ocean circulation patterns that transports heat all around the world. It is “driven by deep water formation”, explains Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, professor of physics of the oceans at Potsdam University and co-chair of earth system analysis at PIK. This is “the sinking of dense, therefore heavy, water in the high latitudes of the North Atlantic”, he explains to Carbon Brief.  Climate change affects this process by diluting the salty sea water with freshwater and by warming it up, he says:  “The dilution happens through increased rainfall and also melting of continental ice in the vicinity of mainly the Greenland ice sheet. And that makes the water lighter and, therefore, unable to sink – or at least less able to sink – which, basically, slows down that whole engine of the global overturning circulation.”  Recent research suggests that the AMOC has already weakened by around 15% since the middle of the 20th century. This is in line with projections by climate models, says Dr Richard Wood. However, the question remains at what point a weakening tips over into a complete shutdown, he explains:  “Perhaps a much less likely, but larger cause for concern is whether there’s a threshold beyond which the AMOC becomes unsustainable and at that point – if you pass that threshold – then over some period of time, the AMOC might reduce to zero or even potentially a reversed circulation. And that would have big impacts on the climate of, well, the whole northern hemisphere, but particularly Europe.”  This shutdown could happen because the AMOC is a self-reinforcing system, explains Rahmstorf:  “The circulation itself brings salty water into the high-latitude Atlantic and the salty water increases the density. And so we can say the water is able to sink because it is salty and it is salty because there is this circulation. So it’s like a self-reinforcing system.”  Such a system can only be pushed “up to a limit”, says Rahmstorf, after which the self-reinforcing system actually works to further weaken the circulation. Too much freshwater in the North Atlantic slows the circulation, preventing it from pulling salty water up from the south. Thus, the North Atlantic freshens even more and the circulation weakens further – and so on. It “really is an on-off system”, he adds.  There is still a lot of uncertainty about where exactly this tipping point is, says Rahmstorf. To the extent that “nobody really knows”, he adds:  “But, I would say, most people think that to trigger a real shutdown would require substantial global warming – like 3C or 4C [above pre-industrial levels]. And we could pretty well minimise this risk by limiting the warming to below 2C. So, if we actually take the Paris Agreement seriously, then I would feel relatively relaxed about the risk of a shutdown. But if we continue on the current path and heading for three or more degrees, then this becomes a really serious concern.”  (According to Climate Action Tracker, current global climate policies put the world on track for around 3C of warming.)  And it is “important to emphasise that climate models are not suggesting a complete shutdown of the AMOC in the next 100 years or so”, adds Wood: “We’re looking at what we call a ‘low-probability, high-impact’ event”.  The IPCC’s special report on 1.5C of warming, for example, concludes that while “it is very likely that the AMOC will weaken over the 21st century”, there is “no evidence indicating significantly different amplitudes of AMOC weakening for 1.5C versus 2C of global warming, or of a shutdown of the AMOC at these global temperature thresholds”.  Were the AMOC to cross a tipping point, models suggest it would trigger a “quick decline that takes decades and then a kind of slower decline which might take even hundreds of years”, says Wood.  This would be “practically irreversible” on human timescales, notes Rahmstorf:  “Depending on the exact nature of the stability of the circulation, it could be shutdown basically indefinitely for thousands of years into a new stable shutdown state. Or it could eventually recover – both things we observe in different models. But, on a timescale if you’re just interested in what happens in the next 200-300 years or so, that doesn’t actually make a difference because it does stay off then once it dies for quite a long time.”  This “shutdown” state is an example of hysteresis, explains Wood in the video below. It means that once you go over the tipping point, even if global warming is stopped or reversed, the AMOC does not necessarily switch back on again immediately.  As the AMOC plays a crucial role in bringing heat up from the tropics, a shutdown would cause “widespread cooling around the whole of the northern hemisphere, but particularly around western Europe and the east coast of North America”, says Wood. This could be in the order of “several degrees, possibly 5C”, he adds.  This cooling would have knock-on impacts for rainfall patterns as there would be less evaporation from the North Atlantic, says Wood. This could either offset or magnify the changes caused by global warming, he says:  “In northern parts of Europe, we might expect from global warming to see wetter winters and then the drying would compensate. In other regions, more in southern Europe, where we would already be expected to see a drying signal from the global-warming signal, so paradoxically, the cooling would give you a further drying. So it would actually reinforce the climate-change signal.”  The knock-on impacts would be considerable. For example, a recent study in the new journal Nature Food suggests that an AMOC shutdown would cause “widespread cessation of arable farming” in the island of Great Britain with “losses of agricultural output that are an order of magnitude larger than the impacts of climate change without an AMOC collapse”.  In addition, there will be implications for the ocean itself, notes Rahmstorf:  “The whole North Atlantic ecosystem is adapted to the existence of this overturning circulation, which really sets the conditions – the seasonal cycle, the temperature, the nutrient conditions – in the North Atlantic, and so the intricate web of the Atlantic ecosystem will be substantially disrupted if allow such a massive change in the ocean circulation to happen.”  Finally, research suggests that the collapse of the AMOC could itself trigger other tipping points. As the SROCC explains:  “For example, a collapse of the AMOC may induce causal interactions like changes in ENSO [El Niño–Southern Oscillation] characteristics, dieback of the Amazon rainforest and shrinking of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet due to seesaw effect, ITCZ [Intertropical Convergence Zone] southern migration and large warming of the Southern Ocean.”  However, the SROCC notes that “such a worst-case scenario remains very poorly constrained” as a result of the large uncertainties around how systems such as AMOC will respond to warming.  Back to top  West Antarctic ice sheet disintegration  The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is one of three regions making up Antarctica. The other two are East Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula, with the Transantarctic Mountain range dividing east from west.  Although much smaller than its neighbour to the east, the WAIS still holds enough ice to raise global sea levels by around 3.3 metres. Therefore, even a partial loss of its ice would be enough to change coastlines around the world dramatically.  Aerial view over Pine Island Bay, West Antarctica. Credit: Universal Images Group North America LLC / Alamy Stock Photo.  The long-term stability of the WAIS is of particular concern because it is a “marine-based” ice sheet. As the IPCC’s special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate (“SROCC”) explains, this means that it sits “upon bedrock that largely lies below sea level and [is] in contact with ocean heat, making [it] vulnerable to rapid and irreversible ice loss”.  The map below shows the elevation of Antarctic bedrock; the greens, yellows and reds indicate areas above sea level, while the whites and blues show areas below it – by as much as 2.5km. The WAIS itself is more than 4km thick in places.  Acting under the force of gravity, the ice of the WAIS gradually flows out from its interior towards the coast and into the Southern Ocean. Fresh snowfall on the interior of the ice sheet replenishes the lost ice. If the ice sheet loses more ice to the ocean than it gains in snow, it adds to global sea levels.  For example, analysis published in Nature in 2018 showed that the rate of ice loss from the WAIS had tripled from 53bn tonnes a year during 1992-97 to 159bn tonnes a year in 2012-2017.  Where the ice meets the ocean, floating ice shelves form. These ice shelves have a “buttressing” effect, holding back the glaciers on land that flow into them.  Sitting on the ocean surface, ice shelves are at risk of melting from above and below from warm air and water, respectively. In the Antarctic Peninsula, for example, research has shown that the collapse of the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002 was primarily driven by warm air temperatures. While the Larsen C ice shelf, which is “thinning rapidly”, is being melted from above and below.  Because ice shelves float on water, their collapse does not directly cause sea level rise. But thinning and/or collapse of the WAIS’s ice shelves could trigger a positive feedback loop that sees rapid and irreversible loss of land ice into the ocean – which would add to sea levels. This theory is called “marine ice sheet instability” (MISI).  The illustration below shows how it works. As an ice shelf thins, more ice lifts off the seafloor and begins to float. This pushes back (see blue arrows) the “grounding line” – the transition point between grounded and floating ice (indicated by dashed lines). Floating ice flows more rapidly than grounded ice and so the rate of ice flow near the grounding line increases (black arrows). Faster flow means thinning, which may in turn cause more ice to lift off and float. And because greater thickness also causes the ice to flow faster, grounding-line retreat into deeper sections of the ice sheet can also produce faster flow.  What makes this a positive feedback loop is the retrograde slope of the WAIS’s bedrock. Not only is much of the bedrock beneath the ice sheet below sea level, large portions of it slope downwards away from the coast. This means that once ice sheet retreat reaches this point, it is self-sustaining.  (There is also an additional feedback loop mechanism that could further endanger the WAIS. This is called Marine Ice Cliff Instability (MICI), which would see towering cliffs of glacier ice collapse into the ocean under their own weight. The theory is still under debate.)  In terms of tipping-point behaviour, most research has focused on the Amundsen Sea sector of the WAIS into which six glaciers drain. As far back at the 1980s, this region was identified as the “weak underbelly” of the WAIS. Here, the grounded ice flows directly into the ocean with “no significant ice shelf barrier” to hold it back.  Antarctica’s contribution to global sea levels is currently dominated by ice loss from Amundsen sea sector glaciers. Sections of the Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers, for example, are thinning at rates of 49 and 45cm per year, respectively, on average over 1992-2017.  1,000 km Antarctic peninsula Ronne ice shelf East Antarctic Ice Sheet Pine Island glacier South pole West Antarctic Ice Sheet Transantarctic mountains Amudsen sea Thwaites glacier Ross ice shelf Graphic: Carbon Brief. Credit: Quantarctica/Norwegian Polar Institute.  Research indicates that glaciers in this sector are “undergoing a marine ice sheet instability that will significantly contribute to sea level rise in decades to centuries to come”.  For example, model simulations in a 2014 study in Science have suggested that the “process of marine ice-sheet destabilisation is already under way on Thwaites Glacier”. The study notes:  “Although [ice] losses are likely to be relatively modest over the next century (<0.25 mm/year of sea level equivalent, SLE), rapid collapse (>1 mm/year of SLE) will ensue once the grounding line reaches the basin’s deeper regions, which could occur within centuries.”  This rapid collapse “would probably spill over to adjacent catchments, undermining much of West Antarctica”, the study adds.  The SROCC is also a little more circumspect in its conclusions. It says that rapid mass loss due to glacier flow acceleration in this region “may indicate the beginning of MISI”. However, it also notes that “observational data are not yet sufficient to determine whether these changes mark the beginning of irreversible retreat”.  Prof Tim Lenton tells Carbon Brief that whether all or part of the WAIS has already passed a tipping point for irreversible loss is “the big concern at the moment” because of the sea level rise it would cause.  Overall, the SROCC assessment of “partial West-Antarctic Ice sheet collapse” is that it is potentially abrupt and would be “irreversible for decades to millennia”. It ascribes “low confidence” to a collapse during the 21st century.  A Nature Climate Change review paper published in 2018 concluded that “under sustained warming, a key threshold for survival of Antarctic ice shelves, and thus the stability of the ice sheet, seems to lie between 1.5 and 2C mean annual air temperature above present”.  This temperature threshold refers to regional warming in Antarctica, rather than a global average figure. However – as lead author Prof Frank Pattyn explains to Carbon Brief – because the poles warm more quickly than the global average, 2C of warming on Antarctica from present is approximately equivalent to 2C of global warming since pre-industrial levels.  Pattyn, a glaciologist and co-director of the Laboratoire de Glaciologie at the Université libre de Bruxelles, also notes that a tipping point for the WAIS “is not sharply defined”. Referring to the different “Representative Concentration Pathway” emissions scenarios, he adds:  “Studies show that under RCP2.6 the ice sheets continue to lose mass but seem stable, while for RCP4.5, in some cases irreversible mass loss is encountered. However, only a few studies consider the full range of RCPs and most of them only compare RCP2.6 to RCP8.5.”  Glossary RCP2.6: The RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways) are scenarios of future concentrations of greenhouse gases and other forcings. RCP2.6 (also sometimes referred to as “RCP3-PD”) is a “peak and decline” scenario where stringent mitigation and carbon dioxide removal technologies mean atmospheric CO2 concentration peaks and then falls during this century. By 2100, CO2 levels increase to around 420ppm – around 20ppm above current levels – equivalent to 475ppm once other forcings are included (in CO2e).

RCP4.5 is a “stabilisation scenario” where policies are put in place so atmospheric CO2 concentration levels off around the middle of the century, though temperatures do not stabilise before 2100. These policies include a shift to low-carbon energy technologies and the deployment of carbon capture and storage. In RCP4.5, atmospheric CO2 sits at 540ppm by 2100 – roughly 140ppm higher than now – equivalent to 630ppm once other forcings are included (in CO2e).

For example, a Nature Geoscience review paper from 2011 notes:  “The palaeo record strongly suggests that the WAIS largely disappeared, perhaps during the past few hundred thousand years and more confidently during the past few million years, in response to warming similar to or less than that projected under business-as-usual CO2 emission scenarios for the next few centuries.”  Back to top  Amazon rainforest dieback  The Amazon rainforest is the largest rainforest in the world. Spanning nine countries in South America, it is twice the size of India. The lush vegetation is a haven for millions of species of plants, insects, birds and animals.  As its name suggests, a rainforest is sustained by very wet conditions. But the forest itself plays a critical role in the local climate. As the forest is saturated with heavy rains, much of this moisture is returned to the atmosphere through evaporation. In addition, transpiration of moisture from plant leaves transfers water from the soil into the atmosphere. These two processes combined are called “evapotranspiration”.  These processes keep the atmosphere moist, but also help drive convection – strong upward motion of the air – which, ultimately, creates clouds and more rainfall. Research published in the 1970s showed that the Amazon generates around half of its own rainfall.  The result is that either reducing the amount of rainfall or the amount of forest can shift the climate into a drier state that cannot support a rainforest. There are three potential causes of this, explains Prof Richard Betts, head of climate impacts at the Met Office Hadley Centre and chair of climate impacts at the University of Exeter.  The first is a decline in rainfall in response to a warming climate. Model projections suggest this would be a result of “particular patterns of sea surface temperature (SST) change in the tropical Atlantic and Pacific”, says Betts, but there is a lot of variation between models as to how strong the impact would be on the Amazon. The second is a response to reduced transpiration in response to higher CO2, Betts says:  “Microscopic pores in plant leaves open less widely under higher CO2. So the plants lose less water and less transpiration means less water going back into the atmosphere.”  Finally, the third cause would be the direct impact of deforestation – fewer trees mean less evapotranspiration and less moisture entering the atmosphere.  There is only so much drying the Amazon could tolerate before the rainforest would no longer be able to support itself. Beyond this point, the forest would see widespread “dieback” and transition to savannah – a drier ecosystem dominated by open grasslands with few trees.  In the clip below, Betts summarises how the Amazon could be pushed “beyond the point of no return”.  Dr David Lapola – a research scientist at the University of Campinas in Brazil – cautions that, while it is “reasonable to think that deforestation and fire could of course contribute to reach that [Amazon dieback] tipping point”, the hypothesis is predominantly based on model simulations. He tells Carbon Brief:  “It happens that the same model simulations show that if the so-called ‘CO2 fertilisation effect’ – as a basic input to photosynthesis, when atmospheric CO2 increases it theoretically enhances plant productivity – really exists and expresses itself in the Amazon, then it would counteract the bad effects of higher temperature and lower rainfall, leaving the forest basically the way it is now. The problem is that we don’t have experimental evidence proving the existence, magnitude and duration of such CO2 fertilisation effect in the tropics.”  If there is indeed a threshold, where might it lie? Betts says that “3C is the lowest level of warming that might trigger it, but it might need much higher warming”.  A Science Advances editorial last year by Prof Carlos Nobre of the University of Saõ Paulo’s Institute for Advanced Studies and Prof Thomas Lovejoy of George Mason University noted that “many studies show that in the absence of other contributing factors, 4C of global warming would be the tipping point to degraded savannahs in most of the central, southern and eastern Amazon”.  One of those contributing factors is deforestation, which could hasten a shift to savannah as a “fragmented forest is probably more sensitive to rainfall reductions driven by global heating”, says Betts.  In a recent interview with Yale Environment 360, Nobre explains that he “published a paper about this in Science in 1990 that said if we deforest parts of the Amazon, it will become a savannah”. He adds:  “The post-deforestation climate will no longer be a very wet climate like the Amazon. It will become drier, it will have a much longer dry season, like the long dry seasons in the savannahs in the tropics in Africa, South America and Asia.”  Without global warming, a tipping point for Amazon dieback could be reached “if you exceed 40% total deforested area in the Amazon”, says Nobre:  “About 60 to 70% of the Amazon forest would turn into a dry savannah, especially in the southern and northern Amazon, areas that now border savannahs. Only the western Amazon near the Andes, which is very rainy, the forest will still be there.”  Nobre estimates that approximately 17% of the Amazon rainforest has been cleared so far – principally for cattle ranching and soy plantations. While rates of deforestation slowed in the early 21st century, they have recently rebounded. In the Brazilian Amazon, for example, tree clearance fell by two-thirds between 2005 and 2011, but 2018 saw annual rates rise to their highest levels in a decade. In 2019, deforestation rose again – with rates 85% higher than in 2018.  Reports suggest that a change in policy under Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro is encouraging development at the expense of the rainforest.  Factoring in climate change and “widespread use of fire” brings the tipping point closer, say Lovejoy and Nobre in their editorial. They estimate that a “tipping point for the Amazon system to flip to non-forest ecosystems in eastern, southern and central Amazonia [lies] at 20-25% deforestation”. Nobre recently told the Guardian that this could happen “in 15 to 20 years”.  There is “no point in discovering the precise tipping point by tipping it”, their editorial says, but instead to “build back a margin of safety…by reducing the deforested area to less than 20%”.  New research published in Nature Communications suggests that, once tipped, the Amazon rainforest could shift to savannah within around 50 years. This finding, which is based on an empirical model, is “broadly in line with the multidecadal shift durations projected by expert judgement and process-based models”, the authors say.  The impacts of losing the Amazon rainforest would be felt locally and globally. As well as being an ecological “catastrophe” for wildlife, the socioeconomic damage to the region could amount to $0.9-3.6tn over a 30-year period.  “The reduced evaporation and reduced convection would alter atmospheric circulation worldwide,” says Betts, which would influence weather patterns around the world.  Amazon dieback would also make it more difficult to tackle climate change, he notes:  “Increased release of CO2 from forest fires and tree death would accelerate CO2 rise, and with the forest gone we would also have lost an important carbon sink which would mean that deeper emissions cuts would be needed to stop the rise in atmospheric CO2.”  Unpublished results from a new study by Nobre, seen by BBC’s Newsnight programme, suggest that the south-eastern part of the forest – around 20% of the Amazon basin – has become a net source of CO2.  The results of a study seen by Newsnight suggest that a significant part of the Amazon may already have reached tipping point – when the forest loses the ability to renew itself and begins to emit more CO2 than it absorbs.    READ: https://t.co/n5axU2G7p1#Newsnight | @ggatehouse pic.twitter.com/aI4PENnpe0 — BBC Newsnight (@BBCNewsnight) February 11, 2020  There are already “ominous signals” of changes in the Amazon, say Lovejoy and Nobre in another Science Advances editorial published in December 2019:  “Dry seasons in Amazonian regions are already hotter and longer. Mortality rates of wet climate species are increased, whereas dry climate species are showing resilience. The increasing frequency of unprecedented droughts in 2005, 2010 and 2015/16 is signaling that the tipping point is at hand.”  Lapola agrees that “we may be already observing” a shift in the Amazon system. He explains:  “First evidence: a study has shown that the dry season is already getting longer – by a few days in the last decade – in south Amazonia (Mato Grosso and Rondonia). Second evidence: a recent study showed that forest composition is already changing towards tree species that are more resistant to drought. This suggests that the dieback may be more subtle than previously thought, but not less catastrophic.”  The IPCC’s fifth assessment report (“AR5”, pdf) describes dieback of tropical forests as “potentially abrupt”, but “reversible within centuries”. Whereas in a recent Nature “world view” piece, Nobre writes that a recovery from an Amazon tipping point would be “probably impossible”.  Whether a reversal would be achievable, at the very least it would be slow, adds Betts:  “Reforestation or natural regrowth in places with less severe drying could help increase rainfall levels again. Loss of forests on passing the tipping would be quicker though – forest loss can be quite rapid through fire and tree death, but return is slower because it is limited by how fast new trees grow.”  Back to top  West African monsoon shift  The term “monsoon” in its strictest sense refers to the seasonal reversal of winds and its accompanying rainfall. Along with India, West Africa is one of the few places on Earth where this happens.  The West African monsoon (WAM) brings rainfall to West Africa and the Sahel – a band of semi-arid grassland sandwiched between the Sahara desert to the north and tropical rainforests to the south. The Sahel stretches from the Atlantic coast of Mauritania and Senegal through to Sudan, Eritrea and the Red Sea.

West Africa’s dry season, which runs from November through to May, sees prevailing winds “come from the desert, so they’re dry, dusty winds”, says Dr Alessandra Giannini, a senior research scientist at Columbia University (currently at the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique in Paris as part of a “Make Our Planet Great Again” grant). The shift to the wet season sees this system switch, she explains to Carbon Brief:  “When the system reverses, the low pressure over the Sahara – or the land [more generally] – drives winds from the southwest inland and those are moist winds because they’re from the ocean.”  The moisture that the winds bring to the region is part of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), a huge belt of low pressure that encircles the Earth near the equator. Ultimately, the monsoon is being driven by insolation, says Giannini, as the ITCZ wanders north and south across the tropics each year, roughly tracking the position of the sun through the seasons.  (Giannini emphasises that, while the ITCZ and monsoon are “part of the same season and the same latitudinal migration of the rain band”, some researchers prefer to “distinguish between the ITCZ over the ocean from the monsoon inland” and so do not use the terms interchangeably.)  The Sahel marks the ITCZ’s most northerly position and the monsoon brings rain to the region from around June to September.  But the West African monsoon is notoriously unreliable. Between the late 1960s and 1980s, a lack of rain hit much of the Sahel, with average rainfall declining by more than 30% over most of the region compared to the 1950s. This plunged the region into an extended drought, contributing to a famine that killed tens of thousands of people and triggering an international aid effort.

Credit: Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean at the University of Washington  It was Giannini’s 2003 Science paper that identified that the cause of the drought primarily lay in warm SSTs around Africa, not desertification caused by farmers and an expanding population. (Earlier work had shown the connection between SSTs and Sahel rainfall variability more generally.)  The warm ocean temperatures reduced the temperature contrast between the continent in the hot summer and the cooler surrounding waters. This saw the monsoon rains shift southwards away from the Sahel, causing drought. The effect was reinforced by the “climate-vegetation feedback”, where drier conditions saw less vegetation growth, a reduction in evapotranspiration and even less rainfall.  Subsequent research by Giannini has shown the combination of warming of the tropical oceans (in response to rising greenhouse gases) and cooling in the North Atlantic (as a result of air pollution from northern hemisphere countries) led to drying of the Sahel.  Rainfall in the Sahel has since shown a partial recovery. This is due, in part, to a warming climate and a reduction in air pollution rates. These changes show that the WAM is a “very sensitive system”, says Giannini and the Sahel is most at risk because it is at the edge of the monsoon.  The past also hints that a tipping point “is in the [WAM] system”, says Giannini:  “So the past shift – the abruptness of the onset of drought in the late 60s-early 70s – is an indication that the system is sensitive and so it could happen again.”  Theory suggests that a warming climate could actually bring more rainfall to the Sahel. As land heats up faster than the water, rising global temperatures could strengthen the land-sea contrast that helps drive the WAM northwards each year. This could bring more rain to the Sahel and, perhaps, see vegetation return to some southern parts of the Sahara.  There is evidence of similar changes in Earth’s distant past. During the African Humid Period (AHP) around 11,000 to 5,000 years ago, natural oscillations in the Earth’s orbit around the sun – assisted by various feedback mechanisms – saw the WAM strengthen, bringing greater rainfall into North Africa. Evidence from palaeoclimate data – such as lake sediments – suggest the region was widely covered with vegetation and deep freshwater lakes during this time, resulting in a “Green Sahara”.  Research has suggested that the “onset and termination of this humid period were very abrupt, occurring within decades to centuries”, although this is still debated.  But the AHP is some distance from being an analogue for the modern day. The changes were being driven primarily by the sun, not large increases in greenhouse gases. Therefore, it provides limited insight into how the WAM will be affected by climate change.  Prof Martin Claussen, professor of meteorology at the University of Hamburg and director at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology tells Carbon Brief that even in model projections under “strong warming”, the “response of the Sahara is much weaker than it was in response to the change in insolation several thousand years ago”. So, rather than a Green Sahara, projections suggest a “shift of the Sahel zone to the north”, he says.  The response to recent warming has actually been more variability in the WAM, Giannini says:  “In some ways, we are seeing the wetting already, but it’s a wetting that is different also from the past in that it seems to be made up of more extreme events – so more extreme rains and maybe longer periods of dry spells interspersed.”  And, more generally, projections from different climate models have suggested both drier and wetter futures for the Sahel under a changing climate – with the latter linked to a tipping point of 3C of localised warming in the Gulf of Guinea.  Research has also indicated a mix of impacts. A 2018 study using a high-resolution climate model, for example, simulated “decreasing precipitation over the southern Sahel and increase of precipitation over the western Sahara” by the end of the century under the very high emissions RCP8.5 scenario.  As a result, the IPCC’s special report on 1.5C concludes that there is “low confidence” in projections of a “strengthening of monsoon and wetting and greening of Sahel and Sahara”. It also notes that while there are “uncertain changes” associated with a 1.5C or 2C warmer world, it is “unlikely” that a tipping point would be reached that these temperature levels.  Even if a 3C temperature rise did bring significantly more beneficial rainfall to the region, the IPCC says “it should be noted that there would be significant offsets in the form of strong regional warming and related adverse impacts on crop yield, livestock mortality and human health under such low mitigation futures”.  Finally, research has also suggested that the WAM could be affected by another tipping point – a significant slowdown of the AMOC. The evidence for this mainly comes from palaeoclimate data from the end of the last ice age, says Prof John Chiang, who runs a climate dynamics research group at the University of California, Berkeley. “In particular for the Younger Dryas event when the AMOC was thought to slow down dramatically because of the influx of freshwater into the North Atlantic,” he tells Carbon Brief. “West African monsoon rainfall weakened during this period.”  Why AMOC slowdown, which occurs in the high latitude North Atlantic, leads to WAM weakening is “still an open question”, says Chiang:  “There are two schools of thought. One is that colder conditions in the high-latitude North Atlantic can be transmitted via the atmosphere to the WAM, mainly through the cold conditions permeating into North Africa and affecting the monsoon…The other is that ocean circulation changes resulting from the AMOC slowdown ‘rewires’ the currents around the tropical Atlantic, leading to a warmer South tropical Atlantic and thus causing a weakening of the WAM.”  So, another potential mechanism complicates the future for the WAM even more, says Chiang:  “The question is which influence will win out for West Africa in the future – the direct influence of warming, which wettens, or the AMOC influence, that dries West Africa.”  Back to top  Permafrost and methane hydrates  Permafrost is the name given to ground – soil or rock – that contains ice or frozen organic material that has remained at or below 0C for at least two years. It covers around a quarter of the non-glaciated land in the northern hemisphere – including large swaths of Siberia, Alaska, northern Canada and the Tibetan plateau – and can be as much as a kilometre thick. In the southern hemisphere, permafrost is found in parts of Patagonia, Antarctica and New Zealand’s Southern Alps. Submarine permafrost also occurs in shallow parts of the Arctic and Southern oceans.  This frozen ground holds a vast amount of carbon, accumulated from dead plants and animals over thousands of years. There is around twice as much carbon in permafrost than is currently in the Earth’s atmosphere.  As the climate warms, there is an increasing risk that that permafrost will thaw. This brings microbes in the soil out of hibernation, allowing them to break down the organic carbon in the soil. This process releases CO2 and – to a lesser extent – methane. Thus, large-scale thawing of permafrost has the potential to cause further climate warming.  Permafrost thaw in Svalbard, Norway. Credit: blickwinkel / Alamy Stock Photo.  There is already evidence of permafrost warming. The IPCC’s special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate (“SROCC”), for example, says that there is “very high confidence” that record high temperatures at ~10–20m depth in permafrost have been “documented at many long-term monitoring sites in the northern hemisphere circumpolar permafrost region”. In some places, these temperatures are 2-3C higher than 30 years ago.  Meanwhile, the 2019 Arctic Report Card from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) concluded that thawing permafrost across the Arctic “could be releasing an estimated 300-600m tonnes of net carbon per year to the atmosphere”.  The lead of author of the permafrost chapter, Prof Ted Schuur of Northern Arizona University, told the Washington Post that recent research indicates “we’ve turned this corner for Arctic carbon”. He said:  “These observations signify that the feedback to accelerating climate change may already be underway.”  The SROCC says there is “high confidence” in projections of “widespread disappearance of Arctic near-surface permafrost…this century as a result of warming, with important consequences for global climate”. It notes:  “By 2100, near surface permafrost area will decrease by 2-66% for RCP2.6 and 30-99% for RCP8.5. This is projected to release 10s to 100s of billions of tonnes [or gigatonnes, GtC], up to as much as 240 GtC, of permafrost carbon as CO2 and methane to the atmosphere with the potential to accelerate climate change.”  The report also warns (pdf) that degradation of permafrost thaw is “expected to be irreversible on timescales relevant to human societies and ecosystems”. It also notes:  “Ice melt or the thawing of permafrost involve thresholds (state changes) that allow for abrupt, nonlinear responses to ongoing climate warming.”  For example, explains Dr David Armstrong McKay – a postdoctoral researcher at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, focusing on modelling nonlinear biosphere-climate feedbacks – some areas of decomposition may release so much warmth that it triggers a so-called “compost bomb”. This is where the “internal heat generation becomes the main driving force for further thaw and carbon release”, he explains to Carbon Brief, “even if global warming stopped”.  This effect could have its own tipping point, he adds:  “In one study, a tipping point for this internal heat production occurred by the time local mean [absolute] annual air temperature reached around 1.2C, which is when organic decomposition became significant in their model. However, this process depends on how wet, insulated and organic-rich the soil is – all major sources of uncertainty – and will be localised rather than across the whole permafrost simultaneously.”  Similarly, rapid permafrost thaw can also be triggered – and enhanced – by disturbances such as fire, abrupt drying events, soil subsidence and erosion resulting from ice-rich permafrost thaw (known as “thermokarst”). While “there’s no known large-scale tipping point for slumping”, says Armstrong McKay, research has “suggested that it could double our current permafrost emission estimates”.  Overall, the evidence indicates that there are several mechanisms for abrupt regional thawing, says Armstrong McKay, while for permafrost thaw more generally, it is expected that it “will act as more of a continuous positive feedback on climate change rather than an abrupt tipping point”. However, some studies suggest a more widespread tipping point could occur beyond 5C, he adds.  Dr Andy Wiltshire, terrestrial carbon cycle manager at the Met Office Hadley Centre, agrees. At the COP25 climate talks in Madrid, he told Carbon Brief:  “Tipping points relate to the fact that you have a change and then that change almost drives itself, so it means you go from one state into another. Now, we don’t tend to see that kind of behaviour in permafrost – at least in the large scale. So what we’re seeing with permafrost in the kind of modelling we’re doing is there’s been more of a gradual response.”  Permafrost thaw is, however, irreversible, Wiltshire notes. The carbon contained in the soils has built up over “incredibly long periods of time”. Once it is lost to the atmosphere, there is no getting it back. He explained:  “If we stop warming, then we should see the emissions from permafrost stop, but in terms of that carbon going back into permafrost, pragmatically that’s not possible.”  Related to permafrost are methane hydrates, or “clathrates”. This is an ice-like substance formed when methane and water combine at low temperatures and moderate pressure. It is almost exclusively found under the seafloor on continental shelves – areas of seabed immediately surrounding a land mass, where the sea is relatively shallow compared to the open ocean beyond it.  Methane hydrates have been central to claims in recent years of a potential “methane bomb” in the Arctic. The theory suggests that ocean warming could melt these ice crystals, releasing vast amounts of methane into the atmosphere.  A few years ago, for example, scientists identified “widespread seepage of methane from seafloor sediments offshore Svalbard”, which they said “may, in part, be driven by hydrate destabilisation” due to ocean warming. Research also suggested that there were “ready to release” deposits of hydrates in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) under the Arctic Ocean – containing as much as 1,400bn tonnes of carbon. The size of this estimate has been questioned by other scientists.  (For comparison, global emissions from fossil fuels and industry in 2019 amounted to around 10bn tonnes of carbon.)

A review paper in 2016, for example, concluded that there was “no conclusive proof that hydrate-derived methane is reaching the atmosphere now”. Methane released at the seafloor “only rarely survives the trip through the water column to reach the atmosphere”, notes a Nature Education Knowledge, because it is oxidised by bacteria in the water.  Indeed, any bubbles of methane coming from the seafloor are more likely to be coming from permafrost than hydrates, adds Armstrong McKay:  “It has been suggested that methane bubble plumes detected in shallow Arctic seas are from destabilising methane hydrates, but most scientists believe that most of this methane is actually from submerged permafrost which has been gradually decaying since the last glacial maximum, but may be gradually accelerating now.”  In addition, while permafrost soils are in direct contact with a warming atmosphere, methane hydrates occur in sediments at great depths below the seafloor. As a result, research indicates that it will “barely be affected by warming over even 10,000 years”.  Overall, “this makes permafrost thawing the bigger concern to us now”, concludes Armstrong McKay, “with most methane hydrates likely to remain relatively stable over the next few centuries”.  Back to top  Coral reef die-off  Coral reefs are often cited as one of the ecological systems most sensitive to global warming. As a paper published in Science in 2007 puts it:  “Atmospheric CO2 concentration is expected to exceed 500 parts per million (ppm) and global temperatures to rise by at least 2C by 2050 to 2100, values that significantly exceed those of at least the past 420,000 years during which most extant [i.e. existing] marine organisms evolved.”  Recent years have seen a series of “mass bleaching” events in warm water corals, caused primarily by prolonged exposure to high sea temperatures. Under continued heat stress, corals expel the tiny colourful algae living in their tissues – known as zooxanthellae – leaving behind a white skeleton.  The algae provide the corals with energy through photosynthesis. Without them, the corals can slowly starve. Although corals can reacquire their zooxanthellae if conditions turn more favourable, persistent thermal stress can kill off the coral communities of entire reefs.  Coral bleaching in the northern Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia, March 2017. Credit: Nature Picture Library / Alamy Stock Photo.  Mass coral-reef bleaching events have become five times more common worldwide over the past 40 years. The first global mass-bleaching event was recorded in 1998. This has been followed by the second and third in 2010 and 2014-17, respectively. These events were caused by marine heatwaves – extended periods of unusually high temperatures that were themselves boosted by human-caused warming and El Niño.  The map below, from the IPCC’s special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate (“SROCC”), shows how coral reefs around the world were affected in 2015-16. The shading on the map indicates the annual maximum “degree heating week” (DHW) over 2015 and 2016. (DHW is a measure of cumulative heat stress that “describes how much heat has accumulated in an area over the past 12 weeks by adding up any temperatures that exceed 1C above the maximum summertime mean”.) The dots highlight reefs that experienced severe (purple), moderate (mauve) and no substantial (white) bleaching.  Map shows the Degree Heating Week (DHW) annual maximum over 2015 and 2016. Symbols indicate where severe bleaching affected more than 30% of corals (purple dots), moderate bleaching affected less than 30% of corals (mauve dots) and no substantial bleaching was recorded (white dots). Source: IPCC SROCC ( 2019 ) Fig 6.3  Thermal stress is not the only threat to coral reefs. They are also at risk from other factors, including overfishing, destructive fishing practices, sedimentation associated with sea level rise, runoff of nutrients from the land, storm damage, ocean acidification and shifts in ocean circulation.  This lethal cocktail has already seen “persistent shifts from the original dominance by corals to a preponderance of fleshy seaweed or other weedy assemblages” in coral reefs around the world, says a review paper from 2010.  Fast-growing tropical macroalgae can quickly takeover dead coral skeletons, potentially preventing them from being recolonised by corals and leaving them in an altered, albeit stable, state. These shifts can be rapid, says a 2016 study in Scientific Reports:  “Coral reef ecosystems have been observed to undergo dramatic and sometimes abrupt shifts in community state from one dominated by reef-forming coral to one where other space holders predominate. The alternative space holder often, but not always, is fleshy macroalgae.”  Such transitions “have been observed on tropical reefs worldwide, and particularly in the Caribbean”, the study adds. It is typical of ecosystems to show “threshold, rather than linear, responses to slowly building drivers of change such as fishing pressure, added nutrients and rising global temperatures”, says another review paper.  For example, after the 1998 mass-bleaching event, average coral cover in the Cousin Island marine reserve in the Seychelles declined to less than 1% by 2005, while macroalgae cover increased by as much as 40%.  A 2020 study in Nature Communications suggests that, once tipped, Caribbean coral reefs could collapse within 15 years. Such “decadal timescales” are “coherent with the observations that coral cover across the Caribbean declined by 80% from 1977 to 2001 and may completely disappear by 2035, depending on rates of further overfishing, climate change and ocean acidification”, the authors note.  It is worth noting that heat stress has the same destructive effect on seaweed, such as kelp, in temperate systems, says Dr Maria Beger, an academic fellow in marine conservation science at the University of Leeds. She tells Carbon Brief:  “They then also get replaced by macroalgae and/or corals – this is called ‘tropicalisation’ of higher latitude temperate reefs. What both have in common is that the habitat engineering species are being killed.”  The loss of herbivorous fish from overfishing can be a particular driver of coral reef decline, says Dr Mark Eakin, coordinator of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Coral Reef Watch programme. He tells Carbon Brief:  “While ecologically intact reefs can bounce back from events such as hurricanes or even severe bleaching, when they lack their herbivores they just can’t bounce back.”  A 2007 study explains that herbivores “play an important role in promoting reef resilience and in reef recovery” by removing algae. Thus, they are crucial for a reef returning to a “coral dominated states if disturbance has occurred”.  However, the study also warns that it is “naive to assume that the protection of herbivorous species…will result in the reversal of a phase shift once macroalgae have become established”. This is because “most herbivorous fishes avoid macroalgae”, the authors say.  The key here is to have healthy numbers of herbivores that “can graze the algae and thus prevent their establishment”, Beger adds. It is once the algae are big that they are less likely to be eaten, she tells Carbon Brief:  “What we consider as normal coral reef herbivores mostly eat the filamentous algae that establish first once a coral is dead. Once the algae establish past being tiny, they are less palatable.”  Other factors can also affect how well a reef recovers after bleaching. A 2015 Nature study of the Seychelles after the 1998 bleaching event found that, of 21 reefs studied, 12 recovered and “nine reefs underwent regime shifts to fleshy macroalgae”. It explains:  “Recovery was favoured when reefs were structurally complex and in deeper water, when density of juvenile corals and herbivorous fishes was relatively high and when nutrient loads were low.”  Recovery still depends on there being sufficient time for corals to reestablish themselves. A healthy reef can “bounce back in 10-15 years” after bleaching, says Eakin, with “regrowth of rapidly growing corals”. However, “many reefs have shown little to no recovery after severe mortality events”, he adds:  “In a recent paper, we showed that severe bleaching occurred every 25-30 years in the 1980s. Now it recurs in less than six years. That is far too fast when 10-15 years to start recovery is the best case scenario.”  A review study, published in Science in 2007, concluded that atmospheric concentrations “above 500ppm appears extremely risky for coral reefs and the tens of millions of people who depend on them directly, even under the most optimistic circumstances”. CO2 levels have already surpassed 410ppm and are projected to exceed 500ppm by 2100 in all but the most stringent mitigation scenarios for emissions this century.  In 2016, the first study to compare the widespread impacts of climate change at 1.5C and 2C of warming warned that 90% of tropical reefs would be “at risk of severe degradation due to temperature-induced bleaching from 2050 onwards” in a 1.5C warmer world. For 2C, this risk rose to 98% of reefs, the study says, indicating that the extra 0.5C of warming “is likely to be decisive for the future of tropical coral reefs”.  The study notes:  “Our analysis reiterates earlier findings that the risk of coral reefs to suffer from long-term degradation eventually leading to an ecosystem regime shift will be substantial as early as 2030.”  The researchers even note that their findings are likely to be “rather conservative” because they only consider the impacts of rising CO2 and not other coral reef stressors.  The findings of the IPCC’s special report on 1.5C are only very slightly less bleak. It says:  “Even achieving emissions reduction targets consistent with the ambitious goal of 1.5C of global warming under the Paris Agreement will result in the further loss of 70-90% of reef-building corals compared to today, with 99% of corals being lost under warming of 2C or more.”  As experts in Australia told Carbon Brief last year, some of the more heat-resistant corals may be more resilient than these estimates suggest, but what the remaining reefs “will look like – and what the consequences will be for the other reef inhabitants, such as fish – remains to be explored”.  Eakin says “we’ve already reached” a tipping point for corals on a global basis because of climate change:  “We are already seeing severe bleaching around the world and the recent 2014-17 global coral bleaching event has been devastating for many reefs around the world. For example, the Great Barrier Reef lost half of its corals in just two years.”  A 2018 Nature paper describes the recent bleaching as “a watershed for the Great Barrier Reef, and for many other severely affected reefs elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific Ocean”.  The study warns that “the most likely scenario” is that “coral reefs throughout the tropics will continue to degrade over the current century until climate change stabilises, allowing remnant populations to reorganize into novel, heat-tolerant reef assemblages”.  The 2016 marine heatwave “has triggered the initial phase of that transition on the northern, most-pristine region of the Great Barrier Reef”, the study says, “changing it forever as the intensity of global warming continues to escalate”. It concludes:  “The large-scale loss of functionally diverse corals is a harbinger of further radical shifts in the condition and dynamics of all ecosystems, reinforcing the need for risk assessment of ecosystem collapse, especially if global action on climate change fails to limit warming to 1.5-2C.”  The widespread loss of coral reefs would be devastating for ecosystems, economies and people. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), “despite covering less than 0.1% of the ocean floor, reefs host more than one quarter of all marine fish species”. Coral reefs also “directly support over 500 million people worldwide, who rely on them for daily subsistence, mostly in poor countries”, the IUCN adds.  Back to top  Indian monsoon shift  India receives around 70% of its annual rainfall during the monsoon season. For some areas of western and central India, it accounts for as much as 90%. The monsoon rains are crucial for India’s farm sector, which makes up about a sixth of India’s economy and employs about half of the country’s 1.3 billion population.  The Indian monsoon – also known as the South Asian monsoon – is a sub-system of the wider Asian monsoon, along with the south-east Asian monsoon and the western North Pacific monsoon. (Some consider the Asian monsoon to have more than three parts.)  The word “monsoon” originates from the Arabic word for season. It describes a seasonal shift in winds – specifically a 180-degree reversal that triggers the change from the dry to the wet season.  This shift is driven by the movements of the sun through the seasons, explains Dr Andrew Turner, associate professor in monsoon systems at the University of Reading. In the northern hemisphere winter, the focus of the sun’s energy is over the southern hemisphere. This causes a prevailing wind over India from the north-east, bringing dry air from across the Asian landmass.  The transition to the wet season arrives as the sun moves north of the equator in spring and early summer. Here, “northern India, the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding regions heat up rapidly”, Turner explains to Carbon Brief:  “They heat up more quickly than nearby oceans – for example, the northern Indian Ocean – since land (soil) has a much lower heat capacity than water.”  The contrast in heating between the land and ocean causes a pressure gradient that drives southwesterly winds across India. “This air travels northward from the Indian Ocean,” says Turner, picking up moisture as it goes. The rains typically begin in June – the official start date of the monsoon season is 1 June – moving north through India. The rains continue until the monsoon starts to withdraw from northern India by the end of August, as the strength and duration of the summer sun decreases. The rains then peter out for most of the country through September and October.  The maps below show the average monsoon onset (left) and withdrawal (right) dates across India.  Average dates of onset and withdrawal of the monsoon. Reprinted by permission from Springer. Gadgil ( 2018 ) The monsoon system: Land–sea breeze or the ITCZ?, Journal of Earth System Science.  “At a fundamental level, the pressure gradient between the Indian Ocean and Asian continent determines the strength of the Asian monsoon”, says the IPCC’s special report on 1.5C. And so, in theory, “anything which alters either the north-south temperature gradient, or the amount of moisture evaporated from the ocean, could change the monsoon rains”, notes Turner.  With land areas warming faster than oceans, a strengthening of this pressure gradient and the monsoon itself “may be expected under global warming”, says the 1.5C report. In addition, as a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, this may also result in “modest increases in rainfall”, says Turner.  However, a review study in 2012 – led by Turner – concludes that “the evidence for such trends in observations is unpersuasive”. While the observed record for the strength of the Indian monsoon shows a lot of variability, it does “suggest a negative trend since 1950”, the paper says. This amounts to a rainfall decline of around 10% in central India, adds Turner.  A potential cause could be air pollution – from India itself and the wider region, Turner says:  “Air pollution comes in several forms, but most of it is in the form of sulphur compounds – for example, emissions of sulphur dioxide from industry and transport – that form sulphates in the atmosphere. These particles have reflective properties, which act to reflect solar radiation and prevent some of it reaching the surface.”  This pollution “will preferentially cool the northern hemisphere region over Eurasia relative to the equator or southern Indian Ocean – where there are no pollution emissions”, says Turner. Increasing trends in air pollution in South Asia could explain “why seasonal mean rainfall over India has not shown increases in the recent observed record despite increasing CO2”, his paper says. Another study says the aerosol cooling in South and East Asia “may have masked up to 1C of greenhouse-gas-induced surface warming since the pre-industrial era”.  The mix of influences resulting from human activity is one of the reasons that making projections for the monsoon is tricky. Another is that climate models can struggle to simulate the monsoon system, in part because of the intricate interplay of circulation, temperature and topography that drives it.  Some papers have suggested the possibility for more abrupt changes in the Indian monsoon. A 2005 study, for example, used a simple model to identify the possibility of the monsoon having two stable states: wet (as it is now) and second state characterised by low rainfall.  Key to these two states is the so-called “moisture‐advection feedback”. This, the paper explains, is where “the land‐to‐ocean pressure gradient, which drives the monsoon circulation, is reinforced by the moisture the monsoon itself carries from the adjacent Indian Ocean”.  In other words, a significant factor in maintaining the monsoon is the heat released when the water vapour it holds condenses to form rain. Another paper, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) in 2009, suggests this feedback acts as an “internal amplifier” for the monsoon.  The implication is that this feedback magnifies anything that affects the air pressure gradient generated by warm air rising over the Asian landmass. Thus “relatively weak external perturbations” could lead to “abrupt changes” in the monsoon, the PNAS paper says.  The model simulations in the 2005 study suggest how a switch between states could be triggered. This includes cooling of the land surface through large amounts of air pollution, cooling through very low CO2 levels in the atmosphere, or a combination of the two.  Palaeoclimate studies, using “proxy” reconstructions of past conditions, suggest that shifts to a low rainfall monsoon state have occurred in the past in response to changes in how much of the sun’s radiation reaches the Earth’s surface. For example, in the last ice age and during more recent cold periods such as the Little Ice Age.  However, a 2006 study also shows that the albedo changes required to push the monsoon into a dry state – as in the 2005 study – are a long way from modern conditions. Therefore, the authors conclude, “we can be very certain that we will not reach this point in the near future”.  Glossary Albedo: Close This is a measure of how much of the sun's energy is reflected by a surface. It is derived from the Latin word albus, meaning white. Albedo is measured as a percentage or fraction of the sun’s energy that is reflected away. Snow and ice tend to have a higher albedo than, for example, soil, forests and open water.

In an illustration of how contested the theory of potential abrupt shifts in the Indian monsoon is, PNAS have since published a response to the original 2009 paper, a reply to that response and a reply to that reply.  Dr William Boos, associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley and author of the PNAS response paper, tells Carbon Brief:  “The key phrase here is ‘abrupt shift’ – monsoons may change a lot, but there simply is no evidence for them being here one year and gone the next in response to human-induced climate change.”  The “vast majority of studies on abrupt changes in monsoons focus on changes that are ‘abrupt’ relative to the past evolution of the climate system that occurred over tens of thousands to millions of years”, adds Boos:  “Palaeo changes are important, but their relevance to human-caused climate change is unclear; feedbacks that take hundreds to thousands of years to operate – involving large changes in ice sheets or continental vegetation and soil types – may not be relevant if we are interested in changes taking place over a few years or a few decades.”  Prof Anji Seth, who leads a physical climate research group at the University of Connecticut, agrees that “there is no evidence that there is a tipping point where you would go from a wet monsoon to a threshold of very dry”. She tells Carbon Brief:  “All the evidence from proxy data in the past shows that when there is less insolation [incoming solar radiation], less radiative forcing, the monsoons are weaker, and when there’s more, they’re stronger – but it’s a very linear relationship. There are no thresholds seen where there are two stable states in the monsoon.”  Overall, the IPCC’s 1.5C report concludes that there is “low confidence” in any projected changes in the Indian monsoon under warming of 1.5-2C, but that increases in the intensity of monsoon rainfall are “likely” in a 3C warmer world.  For the IPCC’s fifth assessment report (“AR5”), published in 2013, all the models assessed “project an increase in mean precipitation as well as its interannual variability and extremes” (pdf), the report says.  While for monsoon systems more generally, the AR5 summary for policymakers (pdf) says:  “Globally, it is likely that the area encompassed by monsoon systems will increase over the 21st century. While monsoon winds are likely to weaken, monsoon precipitation is likely to intensify due to the increase in atmospheric moisture. Monsoon onset dates are likely to become earlier or not to change much. Monsoon retreat dates will likely be delayed, resulting in lengthening of the monsoon season in many regions.”  Back to top  Greenland ice sheet disintegration  The Greenland ice sheet is the second largest mass of ice on Earth.

A tipping point for Greenland ice melt is unlikely to be abrupt, says climate scientist Dr Ruth Mottram of the Danish Meteorological Institute, but it is clear that there will be a threshold beyond which its eventual collapse is irreversible.  Around half of the melt that the Greenland ice sheet experiences occurs at the surface. The remainder occurs through melting at the ice sheet base and via the breaking off, or “calving”, of icebergs from its edge.  Surface melt is likely to involve a number of different self-reinforcing feedback loops that can speed up melting, explains Mottram. She tells Carbon Brief:  “Probably the most important ‘tipping point’ feedback though are elevation feedbacks – as the ice sheet gets lower via melting, more are areas are at lower and warmer altitudes, leading to further melting.”  In the clip below, Dr Ricarda Winkelmann of PIK outlines the processes involved in a tipping point for the Greenland ice sheet.  Also important is the “snowline” – the elevation at which the ice sheet is covered in snow. Bright white snow has a higher albedo than dark, bare ice – which means it reflects back much more of the sun’s energy. So if the snowline migrates to higher elevations as the ice sheet warms, it means the ice will be absorbing more of the incoming solar radiation, causing more melting.  Research published in 2019 found that snowline migration accounted for more than half of the year-to-year variations in how much of the sun’s energy was available for melting.  In addition, as meltwater trickles down into the snowpack, it fills the pores in the snow and gives off more heat when it refreezes. This “makes it harder for the snowpack to hold further meltwater, so any additional meltwater will run off directly into the sea”, Mottram says.  The combination of these processes means that a tipping point in Greenland ice melt is “very much related to how much melting is happening at the surface and how much of a snowpack there is to absorb that meltwater”, says Mottram. This has “cascading consequences as the meltwater can affect ice sheet flow speeds and calving processes”.  The lPCC’s most recent full assessment report – AR5, published in 2013 – concluded that (pdf) it is “exceptionally unlikely” that the Greenland ice sheet will suffer near-complete disintegration in the 21st century – equivalent to a 0-1% likelihood of it happening.  However, more recent research suggests that the ice sheet is at risk on longer timescales. A review paper in Nature Climate Change in 2018 concluded that 1.8C (with a range of 1.1-2.3C) of warming above pre-industrial levels would be enough to trigger feedback loops of decline in parts of the ice sheet in summer.  This could set in motion a pattern of melt that takes thousands of years, the paper concluded:  “Thus, crossing the limit of 1.5C global warming this century may impose a commitment to much larger and possibly irreversible changes in the far future.”  The IPCC’s special report on 1.5C – published in 2018 – noted that a “useful indicator” for the elevation feedback mentioned above is the “threshold at which annual mass loss from the ice sheet by surface melt exceeds mass gain by snowfall”.  (This means a negative surface mass balance (SMB) over the course of the year. As an example, the SMB for 2019 was 169bn tonnes of ice, the seventh lowest on record. Total mass balance – which includes the ice lost through calving and ocean melt – switched from overall gains to overall losses between the 1970s and 1980s.)  The most recent studies suggest that this threshold “sits between 0.8C and 3.2C, with a best estimate at 1.6C”, the special report says, adding:  “The continued decline of the ice sheet after this threshold has been passed is highly dependent on the future climate and varies between about 80% loss after 10,000 years to complete loss after as little as 2000 years (contributing about six metres to sea level rise).”  The fate of the Greenland ice sheet is, therefore, still strongly dependent on the rate of greenhouse gas emissions in future. A 2019 modelling study published in Science simulated the Greenland ice sheet out to the year 3000 under different emissions scenarios. It found:  “In a thousand years, the Greenland ice sheet will look significantly different than today. Depending on the emission scenario, the Greenland ice sheet will have lost 8 to 25% (RCP2.6), 26 to 57% (RCP4.5), or 72 to 100% (RCP8.5) of its present-day mass, contributing 0.59 to 1.88 metres, 1.86 to 4.17 metres, or 5.23 to 7.28 metres to global mean sea level, respectively.”  This is illustrated in the maps below, taken from the paper, which show the observed state of the ice sheet (A) and the projected ice cover by the year 3000 under the three different scenarios (B to D). The shading in the maps shows the likelihood of future ice cover, with dark blue areas indicating areas with remaining ice in 16% of model runs, blue for 50% of model runs and white for 84%.

Credit: Aschwanden et al ( 2019 ) Reproduced under Creative Commons 4.0  Following a relatively low emissions pathway, such as RCP2.6 – which is consistent with a 1.5-2C warmer world – may, therefore, be regarded as “representing moderate risk, in that it may trigger…irreversible loss of the Greenland ice sheet”, concludes the IPCC 1.5C report.  The IPCC’s special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate (“SROCC”) also notes that decay of the ice sheet would not be abrupt. It does say, however, that the decay would be “irreversible for millennia” once underway. This is the same phrasing as used in AR5.  While it is possible that the ice sheet could stabilise at some intermediate point during its collapse, it would not regain its previous vast size until the next ice age, says Mottram:  “It is clear from even very early work that the ice sheet is only there because it is already there – if there was no ice sheet in Greenland under today’s climate we would not be able to build it up again. So once it’s gone it’s gone until at least the next glacial period – and we’ll be waiting some tens of thousands of years given current climate change and the slow rate of carbon removal by natural means.”  Back to top  Boreal forest shift  Boreal forests are found in the cold climates of the northern hemisphere high latitudes. They lie just to the south of the Arctic tundra, where tree growth is restricted by year-round freezing or near-freezing temperatures and a lack of rain.  Known as the “taiga” in Russia, boreal forests are characterised by species that can cope with the cold, such as pine, spruce and larch. They cover vast stretches of North America and northern Europe and Asia.  Boreal forests are the largest “biome”, or ecosystem, anywhere on the Earth’s land surface and account for 30% of the world’s forests. They are a very important store of carbon. While there is a lot of uncertainty around the precise amount of carbon they hold, estimates suggest it is more than one third of all terrestrial carbon.  And about a third of the boreal biome is underlain by permafrost.  However, the boreal zone, along with the tundra, is warming rapidly – approximately twice as quickly as the global average. Continued temperature rise could generate rapid changes in boreal forests, including dieback. A 2012 study explains:  “Increasingly warm summers becoming too hot for the currently dominant tree species, increased vulnerability to disease, decreased reproduction rates and more frequent fires causing significantly higher mortality, all contribute.”  A 2017 Nature Climate Change review paper concluded that rapid warming and “naturally lower tree species diversity” could put boreal regions at particular risk of natural forest “disturbances” by factors such as drought, fire, pests and disease. When compared to other ecosystems around the world, the study finds that “future changes in disturbance are likely to be most pronounced in coniferous forests and the boreal biome”.  For example, a 2014 study finds that “continued summer warming in the absence of sustained increases in precipitation” brought about a “turning point” around the mid-1990s that “shifted western central Eurasian boreal forests into a warmer and drier regime”. Research also indicates that “rather than showing gradual responses”, boreal ecosystems “will tend to shift relatively sharply between alternative states in response to climate change”.  Prof Scott Goetz from Northern Arizona University, who is science lead on NASA’s Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE), explains to Carbon Brief how disturbances could cause forests to “tip”:  “An example of a tipping point in boreal forests is a situation where an extreme fire event or repeated severe events render the system incapable of regenerating as a forest ecosystem and instead shifts the system to a sparsely wooded or grassland ecosystem.”  This is more likely to occur at the hotter and drier southern margins of the forest, says Goetz. But a “similar tipping point could occur without fire when extreme drought events kill a large proportion of the trees and composition shifts to other species”, he adds. A new modelling study shows these changes will result in much reduced “aboveground” biomass – i.e. all the living biomass above the soil, including branches, bark and foliage.  The IPCC’s special report on 1.5C notes that “increased tree mortality would result in the creation of large regions of open woodlands and grasslands, which would favour further regional warming and increased fire frequencies, thus inducing a powerful positive feedback mechanism”.  As a result, says Dr Brendan Rogers, assistant scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center, “in places that may transition to grasslands, recurring fire regimes may keep the system in a perpetual treeless state”.  At the southern margins of boreal forests, “aspen and spruce species are most at risk”, says Goetz and, therefore, most likely to be replaced:  “Pine species, shrubs and grasses, as well as more temperate tree species – oaks and maples – will be those most likely to fill the gaps the boreal species leave behind, at least in North America. In northern Eurasia, we’d expect pine species to dominate areas of the currently widespread larch forests.”  A 2012 study of forests in Alaska, for example, identified “a widespread shift from coniferous to deciduous vegetation [that] began around 1990 and will continue over the next several decades”.  But while trees at the southern edge of the boreal zone risk dieback, research suggests that forests at the northern edge could move into tundra under climate change. A 2018 modelling study finds that, even if the Paris warming limits are met, “boreal forests are simulated to expand into the tundra, while on the other hand tree composition shifts toward temperate species along their warm edge”.  Under the existing Paris emissions reduction pledges, the study projects “major climate change effects for more than 80% of the tundra and more than 40% of all boreal forests”.  The graphic below, published in the IPCC’s fifth assessment report in 2014, illustrates the factors involved in a northwards shift of the boreal biome into the tundra.  Illustration of the potential tundra-boreal biome shift under a warming climate. Credit: IPCC ( 2014 ) WG2 Fig4-10.  There is already evidence of boreal forests shifting. The IPCC’s 1.5C reports concludes that it has “high confidence” that “woody shrubs are already encroaching into tundra and will proceed with further warming”.  It also says that abrupt increases in tree cover are “unlikely” at 1.5-2C of warming. Above 2C of warming, there is “potential” for abrupt increases, the report says – albeit with “low confidence”.  For the boreal biome, the report says there is “medium confidence” of “further increases in tree mortality” at the southern boundary at 1.5C and 2C of warming. While “a drastic biome shift from tundra to boreal forest is possible” beyond 2C, it says there is “low confidence” in this projection.  It further notes that a potential “tipping point has been estimated to exist between 3C and 4C of global warming (low confidence), but given the complexities of the various forcing mechanisms and feedback processes involved, this is thought to be an uncertain estimate”.  Significant changes in boreal forests are made more likely by the rapid rate of warming, says Goetz:  “I don’t know that anyone has put a number on a species-specific tipping point, but we have high confidence that with global temperature increases of 1.5 or 2C, which in the boreal will translate into about double those temperature increases, we will see widespread changes in tree species composition and fire regimes.”  Such changes could occur within decades, he adds:  “Fire frequency and severity is the big factor here. With more severe fires and especially with more frequent severe fires, which burn off the organic soil layer, we’d expect to see a shift in forest species over the next two-to-three decades that would persist for many decades to come.”  Shifts in vegetation cover will affect the reflectivity of the land surface – known as its “albedo”, says Prof Colin Prentice, chair in biosphere and climate impacts at Imperial College London. He tells Carbon Brief:  “Northward expansion of the boreal forest is certainly expected as a result of warming and, indeed, there is evidence that it is happening already. Similarly, shrub tundra is expanding into colder regions as a result of warming and this process will continue…There will be, as a result, a decrease in vegetation albedo – especially in spring – which will amplify the warming locally. This is well attested both from first principles and climate model experiments.”  This “would lead to increased heat absorption in the Arctic and more rapid permafrost thaw”, says Goetz:  “Obviously great permafrost degradation means a lot more carbon emitted to the atmosphere, which would have the effect of increasing the cycle of warming and even more degradation, with global implications.”  Rogers agrees that the change in albedo is a key impact of shifting boreal forests. He tells Carbon Brief:  “We know from palaeoclimate literature that northward forest and tall shrub migration is a major Earth system feedback, mostly because of the darkened surface. This is particularly important in the late winter and spring due to the combination of high snow cover and moderate incoming solar radiation.”  In fact, he adds, “the full extent of ice ages [in Earth’s history] is impossible without this feedback”. For the modern day, “we expect this to be a warming effect, and we’re already witnessing shrubs getting denser and taller, and trees migrating north”, he says.  Carbon emissions from permafrost thaw and dieback of forests at the southern edge of the boreal biome would be a “double-whammy”, says Rogers.  However, the uncertainties in predictive models mean that scientists cannot be sure of when these shifts will happen across boreal forests, notes Rogers. And it is still not clear whether it “represents a true ‘tipping point’ or more of a gradual transition”, he adds:  “Certainly for any one location, there likely exists a tipping point beyond which the forest will be fundamentally altered – and wildfire can facilitate and exacerbate these transitions. But the boreal is a vast zone, with variation in climates and landscapes that may ‘tip’ at different times.”  Prentice argues that a gradual shift is more likely. “There are thresholds,” he notes, in terms of the conditions required for particular tree species to thrive at certain latitudes or elevations. But, he says, “the effect of warming is simply to gradually shift the geographic location of the threshold”.  He also says that neither the northward expansion of boreal forests nor their contraction in the south are likely to be irreversible:  “Cooling would send them into reverse. It is worth noting also that very large shifts in the distribution of the boreal forests have happened in the relatively recent geological past in response to natural climate changes that are reasonably well understood.”  However, Goetz points out that “fire is the wildcard and can shift forests much more rapidly than from warming effects on tree growth alone”. And Rogers adds that while “forest composition may be reversible”, the carbon emitted from thawing permafrost “would take much, much longer” to reaccumulate:  “That carbon took millennia to be sequestered by the land and gradually accumulate in frozen soil layers.”  Back to top  Other tipping points  The nine tipping points described above do not constitute an exhaustive list – indeed there are a number of other parts of the Earth system that have the potential to display tipping point behaviour.  Some examples include: shutdown of Antarctic bottom water formation; loss of alpine glaciers; a climate change-induced hole in the ozone layer above the Arctic; ocean anoxia (where areas of the ocean see a dramatic decline in oxygen); and a change in the frequency and/or strength of El Niño events.  Another example that is often cited is the decline of Arctic sea ice. Climate model simulations have suggested that summer sea ice extent in the Arctic could see abrupt and accelerating declines during this century. Such a potential decline is associated with the ice-albedo mechanism, explains Dr Dirk Notz, head of the Sea ice in the Earth system research group at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. He tells Carbon Brief:  “Less sea ice in one year implies more absorption of solar heat by the ocean, thus more warmth available to melt ice further, thus causing less sea ice the year after.”  The “idea of such a sea-ice tipping point was quite popular perhaps a decade ago”, says Prof Mark Serreze, director of the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). A 2005 paper in the Journal of Climate, for example, asked “Have we passed a tipping point?“ in response to thinning Arctic sea ice between 1988 and 2003.  However, the theory has not been supported by the latest research, Serreze tells Carbon Brief:  “More recent work argues that the trajectory to a seasonally ice-free ocean will be pretty much along the path that we are observing – a downward trend with strong ups and downs from year to year (and over multiple years) reflecting the influences of natural variability.”  Research by Notz and colleagues, for example, has shown that large declines in summer sea ice are reversible. Notz explains:  “After a year with anomalously little sea ice, the sea ice usually recovers somewhat in the year afterwards. This is because in addition to the amplifying ice-albedo feedback, there are dampening feedbacks that stabilise the ice cover from one year to the next.”  For example, less ice in summer means more open water going into winter. Without the insulating effect of the ice, the Arctic Ocean subsequently loses a greater amount of heat, which means it sees more ice growth in winter. In addition, thin ice in winter grows faster than thick ice, giving the chance for some degree of recovery after a small extent in summer.  Arctic sea ice breaking apart.

These feedbacks “imply that the memory of the sea ice cover is largely reset during winter”, says Notz, making the ice loss approximately linear in response to rising greenhouse gases.  However, while sea ice itself might not be a tipping element, ecological systems associated with it might well be, adds Notz:  “If the ice is gone completely in a given summer, any ecosystem that needs the continuous existence of sea ice might be wiped out ‘forever’.”  Another concern around tipping points is the potential for one to trigger a “cascade” effect on others. A Nature commentary from November 2019, for example, argues that “cascading effects might be common” in the Earth system, warning that this would be “an existential threat to civilization”.  It references a 2018 Science paper that assessed how 30 different potential social-ecological “regime shifts” could interact with o",Explainer: Nine ‘tipping points’ that could be triggered by climate change,true,265405875107666891812352990602690452684
36a280c7,"The South Pole, the most isolated part of the planet, is also one of the most rapidly warming ones, scientists said Monday, with surface air temperatures rising since the 1990s at a rate that is three times faster than the global average. While the warming could be the result of natural climate change alone, the researchers said, it is likely that the effects of human-caused warming contributed to it. The pole, home to a United States research base in the high, icy emptiness of the Antarctic interior, warmed by about 0.6 degrees Celsius, or 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit, per decade over the past 30 years, the researchers reported in a paper published in Nature Climate Change. The global average over that time was about 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade. Although parts of coastal Antarctica are losing ice, which contributes to sea level rise, the pole is in no danger of melting, as the year-round average temperature is still about minus-50 degrees Celsius. But the finding shows that no place is unaffected by change on a warming planet.","Belgian government Minister Fremault announced that Brussels is halting their 5G plans due to the negative health effects. Celine Fremault, Minister of the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region Responsible For Housing, Quality Of Life, Environment And Energy released the statement in an interview with L’Echo: “I cannot welcome such technology if the radiation standards, which must protect the citizen, are not respected, 5G or not. The people of Brussels are not guinea pigs whose health I can sell at a profit. We cannot leave anything to doubt."" Minister Fremault accurately identified that the 5G pilot project will not be compatible with Belgian radiation safety standards of 9 V/m, or 95 mW/m2, and has stated that she will not be making an exception. In the guidelines the threshold for extreme concern is 1 mW/m2, however many government agencies still only consider thermal effects and profit rather than the cumulative body of the thousands of peer reviewed scientific studies. With Brussels heading up the EU, and with one of the 2 major 5G appeals being addressed to the EU officials officials they seem to be better informed and motivated to protect themselves in the EU. Hopefully support continues to build for Minister Celine Fremault and all officials who are hearing the call to sanity and plea of the people to prioritize their safety over the technocratic oligarchy.

The question that should be really be asked by everyone is does 5G pose a threat to all biological life? It hasn’t been fully tested, and the results of independent evidence is overwhelmingly suggesting that yes 5G dose pose a major threat. That is unless you ask the telecommunications networks and the agencies and officials within their deep pockets who release untruths, withhold information, and attempt to quash pushback. In a US senate hearing the wireless industry even brashly admitted they have not done any safety studies and don’t plan to. Hundreds of scientists are trying to sound the alarm and raise the red flags. Dr. Martin Pall has conducted research that has laid out the mechanisms of how wireless radiation causes harm in our cells, and calls 5G “the stupidest idea in the history of the world.” Unfortunately those deep pockets of the telecommunications giants run deep and wide, within corporatized halls of government full of lobbyists that drown out the voice of reason with dreams of grandeur, control and greed for the unprecedented economic opportunities of the full on commercial exploitation of reality for even more profit and deprivation among these agenda pushers stuck in hive mind states blinded by the control and dollar signs obsessions, who are at the very least incapable of seeing where all this is heading and what will happen to them, their families, and all life on Earth. All of the industry and its sheepeople are being presented with scientific evidence of this catastrophe in the making, and being asked to wait for testing before forcing 5G upon the world. Yet they are refusing to listen and continue towing their control and profit pushing line. Why is this being allowed, how can it be ignored unless they have a dark agenda that includes a shadow of expression for an utter disdain for life. Perhaps even at the core of this desire lays an agenda to exit the human condition via AI and transhumanism seeking escape through technology rather than humanity and connection with divinity. Why else would this be pushed for so hard, untested, at all costs, ignoring the plea of science, it does make one wonder.

db830542,"“This will become an important year for [anecdotes about] the importance of temperature. Despite the fact that these forests were really soaked down this winter and spring, these heat waves have dried things out enough to promote really large fires,” says Park Williams, a research scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University.  In other words, the weeks of heat that baked the West in July and August were enough to wipe away some of the fire-dampening effect of the winter storms.  “The last 60 to 90 days have been exceptionally warm and dry, the perfect recipe for drying out fuels (the one ingredient besides ignitions you need for fire in these systems),” said John Abatzoglou, a professor of geography at the University of Idaho, in an email. “I was running a few numbers this morning, and the last 60 days have been record warm from Spokane, Washington, to Medford, Oregon; both Seattle and Missoula earlier this summer set records for the longest number of days without measurable rain.”  This excessive heat can have an outsize effect on the size of forest fires. For more than three decades, wildfire researchers have known that fire and aridity, which is controlled by heat, exist in an exponential relationship. Every degree of warming does more to promote fire than the previous degree of warming, Williams said.  “Now, thinking about temperature trends due to human-caused climate change, we think that the western United States is 1.5 [degrees] Celsius, or 3 degrees Fahrenheit, hotter than it would be in absence of climate change. And there’s a heat wave on top of that,” said Williams. “Because of the exponential influence of temperature, that means that this heat wave is having a way worse influence on fire than it would in absence of human-caused warming.”  In the runaway consequences of each additional degree of warming, wildfires are a “canary in the coal mine” for the effects of climate change, Williams said.  And global warming is already having an effect on wildfire. In a paper published last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Williams and Abatzoglou found that the total area burned in the western United States over the past 33 years was double the size it would have been without any human-caused warming.  “The added forest fire area—due to just the degree and a half Celsius of warming—equaled the area of Massachusetts and Connecticut combined,” Williams told me.  Other researchers have arrived at similar conclusions. A paper published in Science last year found that “large wildfire activity increased suddenly and markedly in the mid-1980s, with higher large-wildfire frequency, longer wildfire durations, and longer wildfire seasons.” The mid-1980s is also when most scientists argue that the effects of global warming began to be broadly felt.",Has Climate Change Intensified 2017’s Western Wildfires?,true,
,"Texas lifted its mask mandate and capacity restrictions on restaurants and other businesses Wednesday, despite experts warning the ""100 percent"" relaxation of coronavirus curbs will exacerbate the spread of worrying variants.  The Lone Star State became the fifth to rescind its face covering order in a sign of increasing optimism about the pandemic in the world's hardest hit country, where the infection rate has fallen dramatically since January but still remains high in absolute terms.  ""It is now time to open Texas 100 percent,"" said Governor Greg Abbott when he announced his plans to ease restrictions last week.  The Texas Rangers meanwhile are set to become the first major US professional sports team to welcome back a capacity crowd after announcing ticketing plans for the upcoming baseball season on Wednesday.  The Rangers said their 40,300-capacity ballpark would operate at full capacity for two exhibition games against Milwaukee on March 29-30 and the season opener against the Toronto Blue Jays on April 5.  The moves came as the immunization campaign was gathering momentum, with 62 million people so far receiving one or more doses -- about 19 percent of the adult population -- and Alaska became the first state to open up the shots to anyone aged 16 or over.  The White House on Wednesday announced plans to acquire 100 million more vaccines from Johnson & Johnson, giving the United States contingency capacity as it targets inoculating the adult population of 270 million people by May.  ""We need maximum flexibility, there's always a chance that we'll encounter unexpected challenges, or there'll be a new need for a vaccination effort,"" said President Joe Biden, explaining the decision.  He added: ""If we have a surplus, we're going to share it with the rest of the world,"" stressing the US had committed $4 billion to Covax, the global initiative to distribute vaccines to lower-income countries.  Story continues  Biden said he would launch the next phase of the country's Covid response in a primetime address Thursday.  - Texans mixed on masks -  In downtown Houston, the biggest city of the nation's second most populous state, the overwhelming majority of people continued to wear their masks despite the new order.  Businessman Omar Abu-Shaaban called the move a politically motivated nod to the governor's anti-science Republican base.  ""I don't think he had the health of the people in mind,"" he said.  But 22-year-old Kade Phillips told AFP he supported the decision.  ""I think it's good for everyone to be able to make their own choice and what they choose for their body,"" he said.  Popular grocery chains had already said they would keep their mask orders in place, while cities can also keep the orders on municipal buildings and there are also no changes to the rule on federal property.  Support for mask measures is strongly divided along political lines, with people in more conservative and rural parts of the country more likely to view them as an affront to personal freedom.  - Celebrating too early? -  More than 529,000 Americans have died from Covid-19 but while cases have declined dramatically since the January 11 peak, the infection rate has been plateauing since the last week of February at around 60,000 new cases per day.  Peter Hotez, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine, tweeted he was worried about a ""perfect storm"" coming to Texas with the lifting of the mask mandate, one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, rising cases of the B.1.1.7 variant first seen in Britain, an uptick in the test positivity rate and spring break.  In Maryland, which borders the capital Washington, Governor Larry Hogan announced that effective Friday the state would lift capacity limits on both outdoor and indoor dining, retail businesses and places of worship and allow large outdoor and indoor venues to begin operating at 50 percent capacity.  And Los Angeles and southern California will be allowed to partially reopen indoor dining and movie theaters from this weekend, Governor Gavin Newsom said, as the region hit key health criteria.  Hotez cautioned against a ""national race to the bottom"" adding that while the United States doesn't have enough vaccines yet, it will in two months' time.

The emergency use authorization allows the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to be distributed in the U.S.  “The FDA’s authorization for emergency use of the first COVID-19 vaccine is a significant milestone in battling this devastating pandemic that has affected so many families in the United States and around the world,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “Today’s action follows an open and transparent review process that included input from independent scientific and public health experts and a thorough evaluation by the agency’s career scientists to ensure this vaccine met FDA’s rigorous, scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization. The tireless work to develop a new vaccine to prevent this novel, serious, and life-threatening disease in an expedited timeframe after its emergence is a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide.”  The FDA has determined that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has met the statutory criteria for issuance of an EUA. The totality of the available data provides clear evidence that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine may be effective in preventing COVID-19. The data also support that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks, supporting the vaccine’s use in millions of people 16 years of age and older, including healthy individuals. In making this determination, the FDA can assure the public and medical community that it has conducted a thorough evaluation of the available safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality information.  The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine contains messenger RNA (mRNA), which is genetic material. The vaccine contains a small piece of the SARS-CoV-2 virus’s mRNA that instructs cells in the body to make the virus’s distinctive “spike” protein. When a person receives this vaccine, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease, but triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against SARS-CoV-2.  “While not an FDA approval, today’s emergency use authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine holds the promise to alter the course of this pandemic in the United States,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “With science guiding our decision-making, the available safety and effectiveness data support the authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine because the vaccine’s known and potential benefits clearly outweigh its known and potential risks. The data provided by the sponsor have met the FDA’s expectations as conveyed in our June and October guidance documents. Efforts to speed vaccine development have not sacrificed scientific standards or the integrity of our vaccine evaluation process. The FDA’s review process also included public and independent review from members of the agency’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. Today’s achievement is ultimately a testament to the commitment of our career scientists and physicians, who worked tirelessly to thoroughly evaluate the data and information for this vaccine.”  FDA Evaluation of Available Safety Data  Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is administered as a series of two doses, three weeks apart. The available safety data to support the EUA include 37,586 of the participants enrolled in an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled international study, the majority of whom are U.S. participants. These participants, 18,801 of whom received the vaccine and 18,785 of whom received saline placebo, were followed for a median of two months after receiving the second dose. The most commonly reported side effects, which typically lasted several days, were pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, and fever. Of note, more people experienced these side effects after the second dose than after the first dose, so it is important for vaccination providers and recipients to expect that there may be some side effects after either dose, but even more so after the second dose.  It is mandatory for Pfizer Inc. and vaccination providers to report the following to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine: all vaccine administration errors, serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS), and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death.  FDA Evaluation of Available Effectiveness Data  The effectiveness data to support the EUA include an analysis of 36,523 participants in the ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled international study, the majority of whom are U.S. participants, who did not have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection through seven days after the second dose. Among these participants, 18,198 received the vaccine and 18,325 received placebo. The vaccine was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19 disease among these clinical trial participants with eight COVID-19 cases in the vaccine group and 162 in the placebo group. Of these 170 COVID-19 cases, one in the vaccine group and three in the placebo group were classified as severe. At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person.  The EUA Process  On the basis of the determination by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services on February 4, 2020, that there is a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad, and then issued declarations that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of unapproved products, the FDA may issue an EUA to allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent COVID-19 when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives.  The issuance of an EUA is different than an FDA approval (licensure) of a vaccine. In determining whether to issue an EUA for a product, the FDA evaluates the available evidence and assesses any known or potential risks and any known or potential benefits, and if the benefit-risk assessment is favorable, the product is made available during the emergency. Once a manufacturer submits an EUA request for a COVID-19 vaccine to the FDA, the agency then evaluates the request and determines whether the relevant statutory criteria are met, taking into account the totality of the scientific evidence about the vaccine that is available to the FDA.  The EUA also requires that fact sheets that provide important information, including dosing instructions, and information about the benefits and risks of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, be made available to vaccination providers and vaccine recipients.  The company has submitted a pharmacovigilance plan to FDA to monitor the safety of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The pharmacovigilance plan includes a plan to complete longer-term safety follow-up for participants enrolled in ongoing clinical trials. The pharmacovigilance plan also includes other activities aimed at monitoring the safety profile of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and ensuring that any safety concerns are identified and evaluated in a timely manner.  The FDA also expects manufacturers whose COVID-19 vaccines are authorized under an EUA to continue their clinical trials to obtain additional safety and effectiveness information and pursue approval (licensure).  The EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was issued to Pfizer Inc. The EUA will be effective until the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biologics for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is terminated, and may be revised or revoked if it is determined the EUA no longer meets the statutory criteria for issuance.  The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.

4345f8fc,"The biggest issue, according to several people familiar with negotiations, involves a Democratic attempt to control the costs of vaccines and other treatments that are developed in response to the outbreak. Other issues include details of hospital reimbursement for uninsured patients and whether to pay for a provision to help expand telemedicine, which would cost roughly $500 million. “Vaccines should be affordable. It’s just as simple as that,” Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), a top appropriator, said as she left a Democratic leadership meeting on Tuesday night. “It’s going back and forth. That’s where we are,” DeLauro added. “There are no firm answers at the moment, but we’re moving toward getting this done and getting it done this week because the need is so critical. We have to get it done this week.” Pelosi and her top deputies briefed their fellow Democrats on the status of the emergency funding package on Tuesday night and outlined the remaining issues. A final deal could still be reached Tuesday night, they said, but could take until Wednesday morning. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had complained earlier Tuesday that Republican lawmakers were resisting Democratic efforts to stave off potential price-gauging of vaccines or other products. “Our Republican friends don't want to see the kinds of limitations that we want to see,"" Schumer said after a briefing with members of the White House’s coronavirus task force, including Vice President Mike Pence and HHS Secretary Alex Azar. The 11th hour policy battles come after both parties had intended to present a united front against the potential epidemic, with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California each touting positive conversations with each other about the package as recently as Tuesday. Republicans and Democrats both stressed that the response to the virus should avoid mudslinging and fingerpointing. Still, some of the final details of the massive funding package have come down to partisan talking points. Democrats are insisting the spending package include significant funding to purchase large amounts of coronavirus diagnostics, treatments and vaccine, when it becomes available, which would then be made available to the public free of cost, according to a senior Democratic aide. The Democratic aide said Republicans are trying to eliminate the “fair and reasonable price” federal procurement standard for the vaccines and treatments that will be developed and purchased with the emergency funds. “Fair and reasonable price” is a basic standard to prevent price gouging in federal contracts. Republicans, however, argue they are trying to fight Democratic efforts to create a new set of price controls and that they are not asking for changes to the underlying procurement standards. The administration's top scientists have said any coronavirus vaccine could be at least a year away from reaching the market. Moderna Therapeutics is working with National Institutes of Health on a vaccine while Johnson & Johnson has received funding from HHS's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. The bill would provide funding for masks, ventilators, community preparations and vaccine development, Schumer said. But it's silent on how much vaccines developed with the government's backing should cost. “We are not going to say the companies after we taxpayers have paid for it, ‘now go out and make a huge profit.’ That's not going to happen,” said Senate Appropriations ranking member Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.). Congressional leaders still plan to pass an emergency package by the end of this week, with funding levels much closer to the $8.5 billion Democrats suggested than the Trump administration's $2.5 billion request. Both House and Senate leaders have stepped into overdrive as the global coronavirus outbreak poses a rising threat to the U.S., with 122 cases of the virus now reported. Lawmakers have also dramatically stepped up their oversight of the Trump administration's response, which had drawn flak in the early days of the outbreak, with its mixed messaging and a slow rollout of tests as cases accumuluate. Senate Democrats on Tuesday confronted Pence over the federal government’s response to the outbreak, even as leaders of both parties have quietly urged lawmakers to present a united front. Multiple Democrats said Pence and the task force did not have enough answers on testing kits, costs of care and what will happen to people who do not have insurance. Lawmakers including Democratic Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell of Washington, where nine deaths have been confirmed, challenged Pence during the hourlong meeting, which became contentious at times, according to attendees.

They believe they have been exposed, they are sick, they want to get tested — but they have nowhere to go.” Roughly $900 million in the bill would go toward purchasing equipment including masks and ventilators. Murray said that officials told senators they had stockpiled masks, but that there were not enough. Separately, health insurers want assurances the government will help pay the cost of widespread testing or expensive treatment. “There’s not enough test kits. We don’t know how wide it is. And it’s because the president dropped the ball early,” said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.). Meanwhile, at the Senate Republican lunch, one attendee said senators suggested to Pence that the administration’s medical experts be the “point people” for the federal response. “No real pushback other than the recommendation that they just use people that are not politically appointed, real professionals in the area that way there can't be argument — oh, this is just political spin, it’s coming from doctors,” the attendee said. Pence, who President Donald Trump designated the lead on the virus response last week, made the rounds as the Trump administration tried to move past a raucous few days of partisan finger-pointing. Earlier on Tuesday, Pence hosted a group of House members who belong to the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus in the White House situation room. His message, according to several attendees, was to avoid political bickering as the U.S. grapples with a health crisis with a scale that remains unknown. Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.) laid out concerns with the administration’s outreach, including mixed messaging from Trump himself and various health agencies, according to multiple people in the room. Murphy, whose home city of Orlando includes Disney World, pressed Pence on which source of information should be trusted. Pence instructed her to refer to the CDC’s website. Another Democrat, Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota, challenged information the administration has presented about the risk of transmission. He later said he urged the administration to be as transparent and “as conservative” as possible.

SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- California Governor Gavin Newsom's unusual disappearance from public view has the ""Twitterverse"" buzzing and Newsom's wife telling inquiring critics to ""stop hating and get a life.""Newsom was in Monterey Tuesday for a fireside chat at the California Economic Summit, making his first public appearance since he got his booster shot on Oct. 27.Newsom touched on his personal life balancing family and work, which he describes ""hell of a couple years for all of us,"" especially for all parents. When asked about the last nearly two weeks of his absence from public events including the long-planned trip to the UN climate conference in Scotland, Newsom said he spent time with his kids.""They kind of had an intervention, they said they couldn't believe that I was gonna miss Halloween,"" he said. ""And I woke up that next morning with something's probably familiar to a lot of parents that knot in your stomach that had no damn choice. I had to cancel that trip.""But prior to that, questions about the governor's whereabouts were swirling around social media. It started when the possible Presidential contender abruptly canceled a long-planned trip to the United Nations climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland.Newsom cited unspecified ""family obligations"" as the reason for the last-minute stay-at-home decision, but gave no specifics.Questions really started to bubble up after the governor who rarely goes a day without some type of media appearance went silent after receiving a highly touted COVID booster shot.Here's one of the tweets:""Gavin Newsom has not been heard from since he had his booster shot 11 days ago. There is no way that he would keep people guessing if the shot made him sick, and therefore less likely to get one themselves unless that's exactly what happened.'So what's going on?According to ABC7 News Contributor Phil Matier's reliable sources, planning for Newsom's trip to Glasgow began more than a year ago when Donald Trump was still in the White House.At the time, Newsom's presence was seen as a necessary presence on the world stage in an attempt to counter Trump's anti-climate change policies.Former Governor Jerry Brown played the role in the early Trump years and by former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger when George Bush was President.But now Joe Biden is President and was scheduled to attend the conference representing the U.S., and Newsom was given a three-minute speaking spot.Glasgow, Scotland, in October, is a long way to go for a four-day confab and a three-minute speaking spot and then an equally long flight back.Newsom bowed out, and instead, Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis led the delegation that included about a dozen legislators.The governor's schedule, however, suddenly had a week of no public appearances.And where has Newsom been since his booster shot on Oct. 27?According to first partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom, the governor has been a working dad which is likely the real ""family obligation"" he has been missing out on while successfully battling the September recall attempt.""Funny how some people can't handle the truth. When someone cancels something, maybe they are in the office just working; maybe in their free time they are at home with their family, or at their kid's sports matches, or dining out with their wife. Please stop hating and get a life,"" Siebel Newsom said in a tweet that was quickly deleted.Not that the governor has been home the whole time.Newsom was front and center in San Francisco Saturday for the lavish wedding of a long-time family friend and Getty oil heiress Ivy Love Getty.The wedding was officiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, just back from her big infrastructure bill victory.One might expect such a star-studded event to trigger a constellation of tweets from guests but alas they were all told to park their phones at the door, as Vogue had an exclusive on all wedding photographs.As for Newsom, consider the brief silence a bit of a blessing.

,"In all of the times that we thought about a pandemic, in some hazy future that would probably never happen, the one thing that we mostly never foresaw was the truly epic amount of nonsense that would be produced. It seems like every second minute that a new myth about COVID-19 springs up that needs to be debunked, whether it’s the idea that drinking hot water can kill the virus (remember that from way back in April?) to the newer absurdity spreading around that most coronavirus deaths were actually caused by buses (spoiler: they weren’t). Pictured: At least 50% bigger than your average virus. Source: Pexels And so, when the newest misconception sprang up, instead of feeling elated that my purpose as a science communicator and blogger was being fulfilled, I instead felt the bone-crushing weariness that comes from total nonsense going very every single day of the year. And because this nonsense is about a pandemic disease, and policy makers do sometimes base their decisions on trash analyses published online, I felt like it’s important to address this inaccuracy as soon as possible. Which brings us here, to the claim: that 90% of all positive COVID-19 tests are false positives. This has serious implications, the story goes, because it means that there are actually virtually no cases of the disease in the country, and the government is lying to us all*. Which is, to be blunt, totally wrong. “I dropped a steaming pile of that idea on the paddock just this afternoon” Source: Pexels Let me explain. Testing For COVID-19 The main test used to determine if someone has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is called a polymerase chain reaction test or a PCR. PCR testing basically takes tiny amounts of viral DNA or RNA and amplifies it until you can detect it easily in a sample, and is one of the main ways we test for specific infections. PCR testing has a number of advantages, as well as some weaknesses. The test has a problem with identifying people who are in the early stages of infection. This is because it can be hard to get enough virus on a swab to replicate it in the test, which means that people who have only been infected 1 or 2 days ago may not be positive when they are tested. In fact, the sensitivity of the test can be as low as 40% in people who have only been infected a few days, meaning that 60% of tests are false negatives in this population. This is why many places will retest you if you are still having symptoms after a few days, even if your initial test was negative. Pictured: Somewhat less than ideal. Source: Pexels But in this blog, we’re not focusing on false negatives, we’re worried about false positives, because a few people having their COVID-19 missed is only worrisome if we care about public health rather than strange conspiracies. So, false positives. With the PCR tests used to detect COVID-19, the average number of false positives has been extremely well-calculated. We have been using these tests for decades, after all, and we’ve had the better part of a year to perfect them for this specific disease. While there were some early validations that showed slightly higher numbers of false positives, we’ve now got enormous samples run by researchers from across the world that show the rate of false positives in PCR tests for COVID-19 to be around 1 in 1,000 or lower. In other words, it is incredibly rare for a COVID-19 test that comes back positive to be a false positive. Almost unheard of. It happens, but very rarely, particularly because many tests are confirmed, i.e. run twice. Pictured: Very common these days. Source: Pexels Nonsense Numbers We can actually use two numbers, called specificity and sensitivity, to see the exact rate of tests that are ‘right’ in a population. The specificity of COVID-19 PCR tests is the ratio of true negatives to false positives+true negatives, which works out to about 99.9%. In other words, for every 1,000 people you test who truly don’t have the disease, you get 1 test that is falsely positive. Sensitivity is the ratio of true positives to false negatives+true positives, and while this is also high it’s not quite as high as specificity, averaging out around 98% or thereabouts. This means that for every 1,000 people you test who do have a coronavirus infection, you’ll miss about 20 true cases. Let’s imagine a population where about 50 in 1,000 people actually have COVID-19. You test all of them with PCR tests. Of the 950 people without the disease, you’ll get an average of one false positive test. Of the 50 people who do in fact have the disease, you’ll miss 1 person, which means 49 true positives. In this case, 98% of all positives are true positives, with just 1/49 tests being a false positive. You’ll also have missed one true positive, so your estimated prevalence — the proportion of people who you think have COVID-19 — is actually correct at 50/1,000. Pictured: According to stock photo websites, all science is test tubes or astronomy Source: Pexels Even with very low numbers of infections, the spectacularly high specificity of PCR tests means that you almost never have more false positives than true positives. If we repeat the calculation for a situation where only 50 in 10,000 people have COVID-19 in our sample, we still find 49 true positives and 10 false positives, which means our ‘correct’ percentage is now 83% — still very high, given the low population prevalence in the people we’re testing. In real life, it’s rare that so few of the people we test actually have the disease, because we target testing at those with symptoms and who think that they might be getting sick. And we can see this incredible accuracy happening in real life. In Australia, despite hundreds of thousands of tests conducted every week, there are vanishingly few positive results. In New South Wales, the state that I live in, we conduct more than 115,000 tests every week with <40 positive results. Even if every one of those were a false positive, the false positive rate would still be less than a fraction of 0.1%. More broadly, it is simply wrong to suggest that most tests coming back positive for COVID-19 are false positives. In reality, the simple truth is that most positive tests are just that: positive. The number of people who are sick with COVID-19 is increasing in many places in the world — particularly the UK — despite what certain inaccurate blogs might have you believe. This is the sad truth, and nothing more.",Most Positive Coronavirus Tests Are True Positives,true,26448459653934151147821084374688112102
,"A customer leaves an SAQ outlet on Jan. 6, the same day the Quebec government announced that vaccine passports will be required to enter all government liquor stores and cannabis outlets as of Jan. 18.Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press  Legal experts say Quebec’s plan to expand its vaccine passport requirement to include cannabis and liquor stores is likely legally sound, but may still face challenges from groups opposed to vaccine mandates.  Quebec’s government announced on Thursday that proof of vaccination will be required in provincially run liquor and cannabis stores as of Jan. 18, and warned that other non-essential services, such as shopping malls and hair salons, could be next. The measures are part of an effort to push more Quebeckers to get COVID-19 vaccines.  Officials have blamed the unvaccinated, who make up the majority of COVID-19 patients in hospitals, for straining the province’s health care system. Quebec’s passport requirements already apply to restaurants, gyms and other locations where people gather for recreation.  Under a COVID-19 curfew in Montreal, a lonely doorman stands watch over an empty city  A glimpse into Quebec’s COVID-19 curfew on four dark nights in two lonely cities  COVID-19 hospitalizations look different in the Omicron wave, and vaccination status is playing a part  Cheryl Milne, a constitutional lawyer and executive director of the Asper Centre for Constitutional Rights at the University of Toronto, said the expansion of vaccine passports would likely stand up to any legal challenges, because unvaccinated people will still be able to access alcohol and cannabis through private retailers and delivery services.  “Obviously, they’re thinking they need to step up pressure on people who are refusing to be vaccinated,” Ms. Milne said.  “It’s untested at this point, but so far the courts, when looking at vaccine mandates or restrictions on liberty rights such as travel, have mostly sided with the provinces, who are trying to ensure vaccine compliance or public health measures to stop the spread of the virus.”  Ms. Milne said the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms gives governments a great deal of agency to make decisions like these, especially in emergency situations such as pandemics.  Quebec has reported a spike in appointments for first doses of vaccines since the announcement – a sign the strategy is working. The province’s Ministry of Health and Social Services said 6,000 people booked first-dose appointments on Thursday, and an additional 3,000 did so by 5:30 p.m. on Friday. The ministry said there were around 1,500 daily first-dose bookings before the announcement.  On Friday, Quebec’s College of Physicians said in a statement that the government should use the vaccine passport system to further limit access to a large number of shops and public places.  François Vincent, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business’s vice-president for Quebec, criticized the idea of expanding the vaccine passport requirement to include more types of retail spaces. He said the move would put undue staffing and financial strain on businesses that are already struggling.  Legal experts say Quebec’s plans to expand its vaccine passport requirement to cannabis and liquor stores may face legal challenges, but they think the policies are legally sound.CHRISTINNE MUSCHI/Reuters  He argued that the government should reconsider the policy, or at least cover business owners’ additional staffing and equipment costs if they are required to enforce vaccine mandates.  “The strategy is to get people to get vaccinated, but you’re asking the private sector to do the job without giving them the tools,” he said.  Ms. Milne said jurisdictions may find themselves in muddier water if they begin restricting access to more essential services, such as grocery stores, based on vaccination status.  But she said courts could still rule in favour of those measures if the highly infectious Omicron variant of COVID-19 creates an even more dire situation in the country – or if a new, deadlier variant begins wreaking havoc.  Amir Attaran, a professor with both the faculty of law and the school of epidemiology at the University of Ottawa, said there is no legal barrier to federal and provincial governments making vaccines fully mandatory for most members of the general public.  Federal Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos at a briefing on Friday nudged provinces and territories toward having conversations about that type of sweeping mandatory vaccination regime, saying it’s possible such a policy could become reality in the future.  Mr. Attaran said the most likely legal challenge to a broad vaccine mandate would have to do with the idea that it violated Section 7 of the Charter, which guarantees personal autonomy through the right to life, liberty and security. But he said that section places limits on individual rights if they affect another person’s life, liberty and security. It would be possible to argue that a strong vaccine mandate falls under that exemption, he said.  “The governments in Canada have yet to lose a lawsuit” regarding vaccine mandates, he added.  “As long as they set up a mechanism whereby persons having a medical or religious reason not to vaccinate are accorded reasonable exemptions, then they’ve demonstrated fundamental justice.”  Frank Addario, a Toronto lawyer, also said the new vaccine passport rules are legally sound, but he noted that it’s vital for any government to increase its educational messaging if it ratchets up the severity of its vaccine laws.  He pointed out that people who are vaccine hesitant are often from marginalized communities. Some of them, he said, are Black and Indigenous people, who have reasons to distrust Canadian authority figures.  “If I’m designing it as a lawyer and I want to win, then we’ve got to do a really good job on getting out there and showing that we have really worked hard to reach into all these communities where we have not succeeded,” Mr. Addario said. He added that inflammatory rhetoric toward the unvaccinated could hurt governments in court.

,"The natural immune protection that develops after a SARS-CoV-2 infection offers considerably more of a shield against the Delta variant of the pandemic coronavirus than two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, according to a large Israeli study that some scientists wish came with a “Don’t try this at home” label. The newly released data show people who once had a SARS-CoV-2 infection were much less likely than never-infected, vaccinated people to get Delta, develop symptoms from it, or become hospitalized with serious COVID-19.  The study demonstrates the power of the human immune system, but infectious disease experts emphasized that this vaccine and others for COVID-19 nonetheless remain highly protective against severe disease and death. And they caution that intentional infection among unvaccinated people would be extremely risky. “What we don’t want people to say is: ‘All right, I should go out and get infected, I should have an infection party,’” says Michel Nussenzweig, an immunologist at Rockefeller University who researches the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and was not involved in the study. “Because somebody could die.”  The researchers also found that people who had SARS-CoV-2 previously and received one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine were more highly protected against reinfection than those who once had the virus and were still unvaccinated. The new work could inform discussion of whether previously infected people need to receive both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or the similar mRNA vaccine from Moderna. Vaccine mandates don’t necessarily exempt those who had a SARS-CoV-2 infection already and the current U.S. recommendation is that they be fully vaccinated, which means two mRNA doses or one of the Johnson & Johnson adenovirus-based vaccine. Yet one mRNA dose might be enough, some scientists argue. And other countries including Germany, France, Italy, and Israel administer just one vaccine dose to previously infected people.  The study, conducted in one of the most highly COVID-19–vaccinated countries in the world, examined medical records of tens of thousands of Israelis, charting their infections, symptoms, and hospitalizations between 1 June and 14 August, when the Delta variant predominated in Israel. It’s the largest real-world observational study so far to compare natural and vaccine-induced immunity to SARS-CoV-2, according to its leaders.  The research impresses Nussenzweig and other scientists who have reviewed a preprint of the results, posted yesterday on medRxiv. “It’s a textbook example of how natural immunity is really better than vaccination,” says Charlotte Thålin, a physician and immunology researcher at Danderyd Hospital and the Karolinska Institute who studies the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. “To my knowledge, it’s the first time [this] has really been shown in the context of COVID-19.”  Still, Thålin and other researchers stress that deliberate infection among unvaccinated people would put them at significant risk of severe disease and death, or the lingering, significant symptoms of what has been dubbed Long Covid. The study shows the benefits of natural immunity, but “doesn’t take into account what this virus does to the body to get to that point,” says Marion Pepper, an immunologist at the University of Washington, Seattle. COVID-19 has already killed more than 4 million people worldwide and there are concerns that Delta and other SARS-CoV-2 variants are deadlier than the original virus.  The new analysis relies on the database of Maccabi Healthcare Services, which enrolls about 2.5 million Israelis. The study, led by Tal Patalon and Sivan Gazit at KSM, the system’s research and innovation arm, found in two analyses that never-infected people who were vaccinated in January and February were, in June, July, and the first half of August, six to 13 times more likely to get infected than unvaccinated people who were previously infected with the coronavirus. In one analysis, comparing more than 32,000 people in the health system, the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 was 27 times higher among the vaccinated, and the risk of hospitalization eight times higher.  “The differences are huge,” says Thålin, although she cautions that the numbers for infections and other events analyzed for the comparisons were “small.” For instance, the higher hospitalization rate in the 32,000-person analysis was based on just eight hospitalizations in a vaccinated group and one in a previously infected group. And the 13-fold increased risk of infection in the same analysis was based on just 238 infections in the vaccinated population, less than 1.5% of the more than 16,000 people, versus 19 reinfections among a similar number of people who once had SARS-CoV-2.  No one in the study who got a new SARS-CoV-2 infection died—which prevented a comparison of death rates but is a clear sign that vaccines still offer a formidable shield against serious disease, even if not as good as natural immunity. Moreover, natural immunity is far from perfect. Although reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 are rare, and often asymptomatic or mild, they can be severe.  In another analysis, the researchers compared more than 14,000 people who had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and were still unvaccinated with an equivalent number of previously infected people who received one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The team found that the unvaccinated group was twice as likely to be reinfected as the singly vaccinated.  “We continue to underestimate the importance of natural infection immunity … especially when [infection] is recent,” says Eric Topol, a physician-scientist at Scripps Research. “And when you bolster that with one dose of vaccine, you take it to levels you can’t possibly match with any vaccine in the world right now.”  Nussenzweig says the results in previously infected, vaccinated people confirm laboratory findings from a series of papers in Nature and Immunity by his group, his Rockefeller University colleague Paul Bieniasz and others—and from a preprint posted this month by Bieniasz and his team. They show, Nussenzweig says, that the immune systems of people who develop natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and then get vaccinated produce exceptionally broad and potent antibodies against the coronavirus. The preprint, for example, reported that people who were previously infected and then vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine had antibodies in their blood that neutralized the infectivity of another virus, harmless to humans, that was engineered to express a version of the coronavirus spike protein that contains 20 concerning mutations. Sera from vaccinated and naturally infected people could not do so.  As for the Israel medical records study, Topol and others point out several limitations, such as the inherent weakness of a retrospective analysis compared with a prospective study that regularly tests all participants as it tracks new infections, symptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths going forward in time. “It will be important to see these findings replicated or refuted,” says Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at Emory University.  She adds: “The biggest limitation in the study is that testing [for SARS-CoV-2 infection] is still a voluntary thing—it’s not part of the study design.” That means, she says, that comparisons could be confounded if, for example, previously infected people who developed mild symptoms were less likely to get tested than vaccinated people, perhaps because they think they are immune.  Nussenzweig’s group has published data showing people who recover from a SARS-CoV-2 infection continue to develop increasing numbers and types of coronavirus-targeting antibodies for up to 1 year. By contrast, he says, twice-vaccinated people stop seeing increases “in the potency or breadth of the overall memory antibody compartment” a few months after their second dose.  For many infectious diseases, naturally acquired immunity is known to be more powerful than vaccine-induced immunity and it often lasts a lifetime. Other coronaviruses that cause the serious human diseases severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome trigger robust and persistent immune responses. At the same time, several other human coronaviruses, which usually cause little more than colds, are known to reinfect people regularly.",Having SARS-CoV-2 once confers much greater immunity than a vaccine—but vaccination remains vital,true,137122259927535493904716150166366117009
,"Artist and model Ivy Love Getty, the great granddaughter of J. Paul Getty and one of the heiresses to the oil fortune he amassed, married photographer Tobias Alexander Engel in a ceremony officiated by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi at City Hall in San Francisco. The bride first met her groom through a family member, and they eventually ran into each other again at Paris Fashion Week. “I saw this cute guy who was taking photos of the event and of me,” she remembers. “I naturally went over, and we started talking. Quickly we realized that we had met before, the year before.”  While they were dating, the New York-based couple traveled often. On one of their trips abroad, Toby asked Ivy to marry him. “After attending the Unicef Ball, we went to Capri for three days,” Getty says. “Normally, I pick where we go out to eat, but this time Toby insisted he pick. This didn’t raise any red flags, but when I got to the restaurant, I thought to myself ‘Oh he really planned this. We had a table overlooking the entire island away from the rest of the restaurant. The waitress came, and we ordered our food. As the sun was getting ready to set, we went outside to take photos of it. Toby set his iPhone timer and got down on one knee. The timer went off at the perfect moment as we have the most incredible photo.”  Toby proposed with a sapphire engagement ring on a yellow gold band that’s reminiscent of Princess Diana’s ring. Diamonds from a necklace Ivy’s grandmother gave her when she was a teenager were added around the center stone. “It is the most unique piece of jewelry and so sentimental to me,” she says. “I can’t help but smile every time I look down and see it!”  Because of the pandemic, the couple didn’t immediately start planning, instead biding their time a bit. They wanted their friends and family to be able to celebrate with them, especially as Ivy had lost both her grandmother Ann—the notable interior designer and philanthropist who raised her—and her father John Gilbert Getty in 2020. “When my beloved grandmother passed away, I knew I wanted to have the wedding in my house to honor her,” Getty says. “My grandmother interior designed each room of the house which allows me to feel as if she is there with me. I would be able to look around the room and see something that reminds me of her. Her presence is everywhere in that home. The theme of my entire wedding is the house and my grandmother.”  “I was lucky enough to have stayed in the house where Ivy and Tobias celebrated their wedding,” Vogue contributing editor Hamish Bowles (who has also recently been appointed the Editor in Chief of World of Interiors) says. “It’s one of the great treasure houses of America, suffused with Ann’s alchemical touch.”  Art and panels from the house were incorporated into the save-the-dates and invitations. “Growing up in that house and being around great parties my whole life, I never had to turn to Pinterest for inspiration,” Getty says. “I am fortunate that one of my best friends, who I’ve known my entire life, is event planner Stanlee Gatti. I also hired wedding planner Jocelyn Arelt of Arelt Events. I had the list of creatives surrounding me that I always knew would help plan my wedding. The process showed me how much planning and effort goes into a wedding, and I had so much fun doing it!”  The wedding kicked off with a British Invasion Mod Party at The Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco on Thursday night. Stanlee’s inspiration for the first night of festivities was Barberella, the 1968 sci-fi film directed by Jean-Claude Forest. It took Stanlee’s team seven days to reimagine what normally feels like an airline hanger inside into a full-fledged nightclub, complete with shiny silver walls. “I knew the walls were silver the day before, I didn’t know anything else,” Getty admits. “I didn’t tell them anything specific. Everything has been a complete surprise.”  “I don’t do storyboards, proposals, or anything that formal,” Gatti says. “I put clay on the wheel and spin.”  Guests arrived on the scene in short, sexy sequins, gogo boots, and big half up, half down hair—ready to party just as soon as their vaccination cards were checked and their phones were locked and stowed away in pouches. Dancers put on a show in clear plastic bubbles while Mark Ronson DJed. Eventually, Earth Wind & Fire took the stage. Ivy wore three looks during the course of the evening, all styled by Carrie Goldberg of CLG Creative. A vintage Emanuel Ungaro dress with coral and diamond earrings from Stephen Russell, a vintage Emilio Pucci dress and D’Accori shoes, and finally a customized vintage Norman Norell from Happy Isles in L.A.  “It wasn’t hard to get inspired by each event, starting with the mod themed welcome party,” Goldberg explains. “We agreed that nothing should play it safe, and that we should focus on turning up the volume on the ‘60s vibe Ivy’s so inspired by. We referenced iconic photos of Twiggy, Mary Quant, Jean Shrimpton, and more to set the tone.”  The following day, guests joined the couple for a picnic lunch at the Log Cabin on Presidio, overlooking the city—IV drips were at the ready for anyone in need of help recovering from the night before. “Butterflies are sentimental to Ivy, and so we incorporated them wherever possible,” Goldberg says of the bride’s look for this daytime event. “This archive Alexander McQueen gown from Pre-Fall 2016 had her name all over it: A black lace gown with an open back and a mock neck featuring dozens of hand-embroidered butterflies whose wings fluttered as she walked. It was all about dark romance, something soft but with a dose of edge—we paired it with Christian Louboutin platform sandals, Stephen Russell antique earrings, Chloe sunglasses, and a cheeky Romeo and Juliet clutch by Olympia Le Tan.”  That evening, an intimate group gathered for a ceremony rehearsal at city hall, followed by an intimate dinner at Quince restaurant. Ivy collaborated with her dear friend Paul Burgo of Factory New York on a custom look—a sequin midi dress in shades of fuchsia, black, and white, paired with a custom headpiece. “Accessories were kept sleek but undeniably Ivy,” Goldberg says. “Shoulder duster earrings by Material Good, Amina Muaddi pumps, and a crystal-edged, black satin mini bag.”  The wedding day started with a pajama party. “We have the whole mezzanine level,” Getty explains. “There’s a styling room with all of the extra clothes, and there’s two hotel rooms that they removed all of the hotel furniture from and then there are these individual Margiela boxes with all of the bridesmaids’ names engraved on them.”  “Normally, I don’t do bridesmaids dresses because bridal gowns alone take up so much of my time,” Galliano says. “But as I was so bewitched by Ivy and her stories of these women she had grown up with—her bridesmaids—made an exception. Before I knew it, the bridesmaids numbers reached fourteen! And these girls are the Gen Z babies. I dressed their mothers and their aunties! Creating the bridesmaids’ dresses wasn’t easy with the current travel situation, but bravo to Ivy, Alexis [Roche], and Auntie Vanessa for coordinating everything. You can’t imagine getting these girls all together at Claridge’s at 4:00 a.m. in the morning, walking around in peignoirs for 48 hours to do their fittings. They were so lovely and such fun. Some of the dresses have taken on a more bias-cut influence, and some have taken on a double-layering technique played out in pale, thunderous grays and lilacs, with lamés woven to echo those colors.”  Ivy got ready with cousin Vanessa Waibel and actress Anya Taylor-Joy in the penthouse suite at the Fairmont Hotel. She wore her John Galliano for Maison Margiela Haute Couture down the aisle, paired with a couture veil and headdress. Christian Louboutin shoes, designed in collaboration with John Galliano, completed Ivy’s look along with pieces borrowed from her grandmother’s jewelry collection.  “John has been talking about the dress for months,” Bowles says. “And he’s understandably obsessed with Ivy who is not only beautiful but the acme of cool and charm.""  Stanlee and his team carpeted the entire rotunda of City Hall with bright teal and pink Persian rugs, completely transforming the space. “We draped all the archways on the second floor and first floor with turquoise and rose pink velvet drapes with 12” long gold thread fringe,” he explains. “We hung in waterfall fashion off the grand staircase railings, from top to bottom, thousands of pale pink dendrobiam orchids. Large stone urns on pedestals filled with pastel roses were through the rotunda and a top the staircase. I wanted to channel Ann,” Gatti says. “The colors, patterns and fabrics were a nod to Ann.”  The bridesmaids filed in first, wearing their Maison Martin Margiela Haute Couture by John Galliano dresses. Groomsmen were followed by the flower girls in their butterfly wings. “The whole wedding party looked amazing with the bridesmaids dressed like Vestals in cloudy grey gauze and bias satin, and the flower girls with butterfly wings,” Bowles says. “Ivy looked incredible in all those mirror shards that tinkled as she walked up the steps and the wedding veil embroidered with all those symbols that had so much resonance for her and represented the beloved people in her life. John was involved in every aspect of how the party would look, establishing the hair styles and so on, and the result was incredibly beautiful and poetic.”  Guests were asked to mask up before Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi entered the room and took her position at the microphone. The groom proceeded to recite vows he’d written himself: “Faith in us has changed my world, captured my heart and tamed my soul. Your belief in me and in us has been the biggest gift of my life,” he said. “I treasure it every day. My love for you is an intrinsic part of me. This day symbolizes a new beginning of our journey together. I think of you, happy to know I am yours and you are mine.”  Music composed by Gordon Getty was performed, then best man Frederic Trohler and Ivy’s rescue Chihuahua mix, Blue, supplied the rings at the request of Speaker Pelosi. The couple was pronounced husband and wife. They embraced to kiss, and somewhere amid all of the excitement Ivy’s crown toppled off. Within seconds, Raffaele Ilardo on Galliano's team was up on stage to recreate her look. Queue Myra, the singer known for her hit in The Princess Diaries—she started playing “Miracles Happen” from the balcony, and the bridal party, led by actress Anya Taylor-Joy, broke into dance. It was a surreal moment that could well have taken place in Genovia.  “San Francisco’s City Hall is designed to inspire awe—a symbol of the city’s power and resilience after the devastating 1906 earthquake and fire, with its white marble detailing and soaring dome that looms more than 300 feet overhead,” Hamish notes. “But despite the architectural magnificence—and the panoply of state, with Nancy Pelosi officiating and Governor Newsom and Mayor Breed in attendance—the ceremony managed to feel extraordinarily intimate and personal, with Tobias’s charming vows and his passionate kiss that dislodged Ivy’s crown!”  Guests then piled into black cars and shuttles headed for the Getty Mansion. A Latin band and the Pena Pachamama dancers took over one room, there were bars and buffets tucked away throughout, and a rose garden was erected for DJ Dojah's dance party. The bride wore a second couture look by Maison Margiela with a draped aquamarine choker that worked perfectly with the raw edge neckline of the gown for the reception. “Ivy’s reception dress was exquisite,” Bowles notes. “Like a tattered Madame Vionnet gown in wisps of delicately embroidered pale pink chiffon and tulle, it was like a breath and moved so beautifully for the first dance.” As guests mingled from room to room sampling various buffets, there were moments—like when the couple cut the cake, toasted their guests, expressing how grateful they are and remembering those loved ones who are no longer with us—that felt like a typical family wedding at home, complete with eccentric cousins and all. But then one remembered the setting and its significance: Ann and Gordon Getty amassed a museum-quality collection of European antiques, Venetian paintings, French textiles, and Russian chandeliers over the years. Rooms are covered in gold-framed Impressionist paintings by artists like Matisse, Degas, and Cassatte, to name a few, and decorative pillows made from Lyon silks and embroidered Chinese brocades are strewn across deep sofas. So while Bon Jovi’s wedding ballad “Living on a Prayer” was played, at this wedding, the bride was jumping up and down with John Galliano on the dance floor while guests chanted “Woah, we’re halfway there!” It felt opulent and fun, elegant but also wild. “It was exciting to see the collision of rather grand San Francisco society and all the couple’s contemporaries—beautiful, free spirited rebels being their authentic selves in that amazingly operatic setting,” Bowles says. “They were all astoundingly charming and engaged and engaging. It gave one hope for the future! The party ended at around 1:00 in the morning, but as the ceremony had been so much earlier it seemed far later. The intrepid headed off to the penthouse at the Fairmont.”  “It’s just like everything I could have dreamed of and more,” Getty says. “So it’s wild when something so magical comes true because you’ve thought about it but didn’t actually think it would.” Miracles happen.",Inside Ivy Getty’s Fantasy Wedding Weekend in San Francisco,true,225761225397919572119243248130549004890

d2e759ba,"Three in four labour wards have no consultants overnight. A major audit published today also reveals that almost half of hospitals lack senior specialists at weekends. And just two out of 165 maternity units had a consultant present round the clock, according to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Scroll down for video A major audit published today also reveals that almost half of hospitals lack senior specialists at weekends. Stock image Mothers-to-be are instead left in the hands of overstretched midwives and inexperienced and often exhausted junior doctors. Although consultants are on call from home, they can live up to 30 minutes away and staff summon them only in emergencies. More than half of births take place out of hours. And research shows that babies born then are a third more likely to die or suffer serious complications. The royal college obtained the figures from 165 NHS maternity units – 82 per cent of the total. They show that: Just over 73 per cent had no consultants on the weekday overnight shift, typically 10pm to 8am; Another 43 per cent said none were on site at weekends; 89 per cent said consultants were not present for evening shifts at weekends; Heart of England NHS trust in Birmingham and Central Manchester University were the only centres with consultants day and night, all week. Maureen Treadwell, of the Birth Trauma Association, said: ‘We are concerned at the number of hospital trusts with no consultant cover at night. ‘There are a number of rare but sudden catastrophic events in labour where a less experienced doctor may need the advice or assistance of a senior colleague. ‘These are not common events, but every year some women and babies will die as a result of substandard care, often from staff who are doing their best, but may never have dealt with such a condition.’ The figures are worrying because labours are becoming more complex due to obesity and the trend for women to have babies later in life. Experts say midwives and junior doctors are less likely to spot when things go wrong and can be reluctant to summon the help of consultants. Labour wards are also under pressure because of high birth rates fuelled by migration. Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s health spokesman, said it shows that the Tories can;t even deliver a five-day NHS Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s health spokesman, said: ‘It is crucial that maternity units are sufficiently staffed to provide a high level of care to all who use them – day or night. ‘The Tories talk about a seven-day NHS but these figures show they can’t even deliver a five-day NHS.’ Elizabeth Duff of the National Childbirth Trust said: ‘Women need safe maternity services whenever they give birth. We know more needs to be done to provide the right level of staff to give support when necessary.’ The royal college issued recommendations in 2009 stating that maternity units should work toward having consultants present round the clock. This would improve the care of women and the training of junior staff, the guidelines stated. Consultants are supposed to supervise the care of all patients in maternity units and intervene if something goes wrong. A major study by Imperial College London last year found that babies delivered at the weekend were 7 per cent more likely to be stillborn. And research published by Cambridge University in 2010 found that babies born overnight or at weekends in Scottish hospitals were a third more likely to die. MY BABY WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY IF I'D HAD HER IN THE WEEK Angela Owens pictured with baby Hope believes her daughter Ella would be alive today had she given birth on a weekday Angela Owens believes her daughter Ella would be alive today had she given birth on a weekday. She was two weeks overdue when she felt severe and sudden pain on a Saturday afternoon four days before Christmas 2013. The 31-year-old went to the labour ward at Warrington Hospital, describing it as a ghost town. Midwives repeatedly told her to go home and take paracetamol – and ignored her pleas for a consultant. Eventually – after her GP brother arrived – they bleeped the consultant but by this stage it was too late. When Ella was finally delivered on 11pm on the Saturday she was stillborn. The mother, who has two other daughters with her partner Paul, said: ‘There was a general flippant attitude towards me,’ ‘You put your trust in health staff in these situations, but I had to beg them for help. ‘Hospitals seem to go into sleep mode at the weekends and for us this resulted in the ultimate tragedy. It was horrendous. I will never recover from her death.’ Ella was one of ten babies who had been stillborn or died in unexplained circumstances at Warrington Hospital in a 12-month period between 2013/14. The deaths were avoidable and blamed on staffing shortages – half occurred at weekends. Advertisement The authors said the same would be true for English hospitals. They blamed the extra risks on a lack of intervention by junior doctors. NHS figures show that doctors performed almost 40 per cent of births in 2014/15 and midwives do most of the remainder. They do not state whether the former were consultants or junior doctors. But the figure has steadily increased from 24 per cent in 1989. An NHS England spokesman said: ‘Having a baby is now safer than it has ever been and the vast majority of mothers report that they get great NHS maternity care.’ The spokesman highlighted a study last year that claimed there was no evidence to show overnight consultants made any difference to safety. But he refused to acknowledge other research showing babies born out of hours were more likely to die. Tomorrow the NHS will publish its first-ever Ofsted-style ratings for maternity care in a bid to drive up standards.","In essence, the larger question being asked is: can people without coronavirus symptoms spread the COVID-19 virus?  This question is at the heart of all current COVID mitigation efforts.  If there is no asymptomatic spread then what is all of this mask wearing nonsense and shut-down mandates all about? A research paper published on November 20th highlights a case study of almost 10 million people in China.  What the study found was there were 300 cases of Coronavirus in the population being carried without any symptoms at all.  So the scientists then tracked the asymptomatic carriers.  The contact tracing of 1,174 “close contacts” with the asymptomatic carriers showed ZERO transmission.  Not a few, not a couple, but zero -none-  not a single transmission of Coronavirus from a person without symptoms. The conclusion is not that asymptomatic spread is rare or that the science is uncertain. The study revealed something that hardly ever happens in these kinds of studies. There was not one documented case. Forget rare. Forget even Fauci’s previous suggestion that asymptomatic transmission exists but not does drive the spread. Replace all that with: never. At least not in this study for 10,000,000. [STUDY] … Stringent COVID-19 control measures were imposed in Wuhan between January 23 and April 8, 2020. Estimates of the prevalence of infection following the release of restrictions could inform post-lockdown pandemic management. Here, we describe a city-wide SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid screening programme between May 14 and June 1, 2020 in Wuhan. All city residents aged six years or older were eligible and 9,899,828 (92.9%) participated. No new symptomatic cases and 300 asymptomatic cases (detection rate 0.303/10,000, 95% CI 0.270–0.339/10,000) were identified. There were no positive tests amongst 1,174 close contacts of asymptomatic cases. 107 of 34,424 previously recovered COVID-19 patients tested positive again (re-positive rate 0.31%, 95% CI 0.423–0.574%). The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan was therefore very low five to eight weeks after the end of lockdown. One might suppose that this would be huge news. It would allow us to open up everything immediately. With the whole basis for post-curve-flattening lockdowns crumbled, we could go back to living a normal life. The fear could evaporate. We could take comfort in our normal intuition that healthy people can get out and about with no risk to others. We could take off our masks. We could go to movies and sports events. … We keep hearing about how we should follow the science. The claim is tired by now. We know what’s really happening. The lockdown lobby ignores whatever contradicts their narrative, preferring unverified anecdotes over an actual scientific study of 10 million residents in what was the world’s first major hotspot for the disease we are trying to manage. You would expect this study to be massive international news. So far as I can tell, it is being ignored. [More] In essence, what the study of 10 million people confirmed is what many people, doctors, scientists and World Health Organization already suspected. Like the common cold and flu when a person is infected with the virus they are only infecting others when they have symptoms: cold, runny nose, coughing, aching, sneezing, fever, congestion etc; hence, when a person has an illness they should isolate to not spread the virus. However, when a person has no external symptoms of the virus, just like the cold and flu, they are not a risk of transmitting the virus to others. ♦ This is a major issue with massive ramifications because all of the current COVID-19 mitigation effort is based on the principle that people can carry and spread the virus while having no idea they have it, and no symptoms. If asymptomatic transmission is not happening, and it appears with scientific certainty it is not, then all of the current lock-down regulations, mask wearing requirements and social distancing rules/decrees are based on a complete fallacy of false assumptions. The asymptomatic case study published in November affirms the earlier reporting from the World Health Organization that COVID-19 is only known to transmit from people who are showing symptoms of the virus.  In June of 2020, Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the World Health Organization’s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, said transmission of the coronavirus by people who aren’t showing symptoms is “very rare.” Bloomberg Markets and Finance 847K subscribers WHO Says Covid-19 Asymptomatic Transmission Is ‘Very Rare’ Watch later Share . As you can see from the video explanation, in June 2020 Ms. Kerkhove could not identify a single study or case that was traced to asymptomatic spread; but scientists still thought it might be possible so she -and others- kept using the “very rare” terminology. However, with the latest information and a far more lengthy timeline to study the disease, the cumulative 2020 data shows “very rare” actually means “never”, asymptomatic spread just doesn’t happen – EVER. So why is the entire world engaged in COVID-19 mitigation processes to block the transmission of a virus that has never, not even once, been identified as occurring?",true,
,"August 29, 2014  ‘Lifestyles of the Rich Environmentalists,’ produced by a group called the Institute for Energy Research, is a slick web video campaign designed to lampoon Leonardo Dicaprio and will.i.am as hypocrites for supporting action on climate change. The claim is that wealthy celebrities who oppose industrial-scale pollution supposedly shouldn’t fly in airplanes that use fossil fuels. The group, along with its subsidiary, the American Energy Alliance, churns out a steady stream of related content, from Facebook memes criticizing the Environmental Protection Agency, to commercials demanding approval of new oil projects like the Keystone XL, to a series of television campaign advertisements this year attacking Democratic candidates in West Virginia, Colorado, North Carolina and Alaska. On Capitol Hill, IER aggressively opposes any effort to repeal tax breaks afforded to the oil and gas industry.  Documents obtained by Republic Report reveal for the first time that the group was actually founded by none other than Charles Koch, the petrochemical, manufacturing, and oil refining tycoon worth an estimated $52 billion.  IER has no information about its founding members on its website, and only lists a board composed of seemingly independent conservative scholars and businessmen. Earlier reports revealed that IER/AEA has received grants from Koch-funded foundations, and its leadership includes several individuals who have at times worked for Koch or Koch-related interests. But this is the first time it has been revealed that Charles personally founded the organization.  In October of 1984, Charles, then using a Menlo Park, California address founded a non-profit called the Institute for Humane Studies of Texas. That organization briefly lost its charter in 1989 for failure to pay the Texas state franchise tax. Four years later, incorporation documents reveal, the group rebranded as the Institute for Energy Research, or IER, which later formed a subsidiary called the American Energy Alliance.  IER/AEA’s advocacy contrasts sharply with Charles’ personal brand as a selfless libertarian activist. The industrialist has argued that he is resolutely against special government hand-outs, such as tax credits or subsidies that benefit one industry over another. “Far from trying to rig the system, I have spent decades opposing cronyism and all political favors, including mandates, subsidies and protective tariffs—even when we benefit from them,” Charles wrote in a column for the Wall Street Journal this year.  But Charles’ group, IER/AEA, has fought to protect special tax breaks that benefit fossil fuel producers. Along with issuing press releases against various federal efforts to eliminate oil and gas industry tax credits, IER/AEA commissioned a study claiming that such tax reforms would have an adverse effect on jobs and on oil production.  Charles and his brother David are personally responsible for founding and funding much of the modern conservative infrastructure. The popular libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute, was in fact first named the Charles Koch Foundation, Inc before rebranding. The largest political organization in America outside the Democratic and Republican parties is Americans for Prosperity, the Tea Party-organizing foundation also founded by the Kochs.  The latest organs in the Koch political network have carefully guarded the sources of their funding and direction. There is the new youth group, Generation Opportunity, along with the new veterans-related campaign organization, Concerned Veterans for America. But IER/AEA’s true origin casts new light on its motivations.","Charles Koch Personally Founded Group Protecting Oil Industry Hand-Outs, Documents Reveal",true,9760584251322343154879980817408811619
,"Multiple people described Mr. Bolton’s account of the Ukraine affair.  The book presents an outline of what Mr. Bolton might testify to if he is called as a witness in the Senate impeachment trial, the people said. The White House could use the pre-publication review process, which has no set time frame, to delay or even kill the book’s publication or omit key passages.  Just after midnight on Monday, Mr. Trump denied telling Mr. Bolton that the aid was tied to investigations. “If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book,” he wrote on Twitter, reprising his argument that the Ukrainians themselves felt “no pressure” and falsely asserting that the aid was released ahead of schedule.  Over dozens of pages, Mr. Bolton described how the Ukraine affair unfolded over several months until he departed the White House in September. He described not only the president’s private disparagement of Ukraine but also new details about senior cabinet officials who have publicly tried to sidestep involvement.  For example, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged privately that there was no basis to claims by the president’s lawyer Rudolph W.

4d9c4db8,"Though these types of floods often produce only a foot or two of standing saltwater, they are straining life in many towns by killing lawns and trees, blocking neighborhood streets and clogging storm drains, polluting supplies of freshwater and sometimes stranding entire island communities for hours by overtopping the roads that tie them to the mainland.  Such events are just an early harbinger of the coming damage, the new research suggests.  “I think we need a new way to think about most coastal flooding,” said Benjamin H. Strauss, the primary author of one of two related studies released on Monday. “It’s not the tide. It’s not the wind. It’s us. That’s true for most of the coastal floods we now experience.”  In the second study, scientists reconstructed the level of the sea over time and confirmed that it is most likely rising faster than at any point in 28 centuries, with the rate of increase growing sharply over the past century — largely, they found, because of the warming that scientists have said is almost certainly caused by human emissions.  They also confirmed previous forecasts that if emissions were to continue at a high rate over the next few decades, the ocean could rise as much as three or four feet by 2100.  Experts say the situation would then grow far worse in the 22nd century and beyond, likely requiring the abandonment of many coastal cities.",Seas Are Rising at Fastest Rate in Last 28 Centuries,true,
,"Earth's atmosphere stretches out to the Moon – and beyond  20 February 2019  A recent discovery based on observations by the ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, SOHO, shows that the gaseous layer that wraps around Earth reaches up to 630 000 km away, or 50 times the diameter of our planet.  ""The Moon flies through Earth's atmosphere,"" says Igor Baliukin of Russia's Space Research Institute, lead author of the paper presenting the results.  ""We were not aware of it until we dusted off observations made over two decades ago by the SOHO spacecraft.""  Where our atmosphere merges into outer space, there is a cloud of hydrogen atoms called the geocorona. One of the spacecraft instruments, SWAN, used its sensitive sensors to trace the hydrogen signature and precisely detect how far the very outskirts of the geocorona are.  These observations could be done only at certain times of the year, when the Earth and its geocorona came into view for SWAN.  For planets with hydrogen in their exospheres, water vapour is often seen closer to their surface. That is the case for Earth, Mars and Venus.  ""This is especially interesting when looking for planets with potential reservoirs of water beyond our Solar System,"" explains Jean-Loup Bertaux, co-author and former principal investigator of SWAN.  The first telescope on the Moon, placed by Apollo 16 astronauts in 1972, captured an evocative image of the geocorona surrounding Earth and glowing brightly in ultraviolet light.  ""At that time, the astronauts on the lunar surface did not know that they were actually embedded in the outskirts of the geocorona,"" says Jean-Loup.  Cloud of hydrogen  The Sun interacts with hydrogen atoms through a particular wavelength of ultraviolet light called Lyman-alpha, which the atoms can both absorb and emit. Since this type of light is absorbed by Earth's atmosphere, it can only be observed from space.  Thanks to its hydrogen absorption cell, the SWAN instrument could selectively measure the Lyman-alpha light from the geocorona and discard hydrogen atoms further out in interplanetary space.  The new study revealed that sunlight compresses hydrogen atoms in the geocorona on Earth's dayside, and also produces a region of enhanced density on the night side. The denser dayside region of hydrogen is still rather sparse, with just 70 atoms per cubic centimeter at 60 000 kilometers above Earth's surface, and about 0.2 atoms at the Moon's distance.  ""On Earth we would call it vacuum, so this extra source of hydrogen is not significant enough to facilitate space exploration,"" says Igor.  The good news is that these particles do not pose any threat for space travelers on future crewed missions orbiting the Moon.  ""There is also ultraviolet radiation associated to the geocorona, as the hydrogen atoms scatter sunlight in all directions, but the impact on astronauts in lunar orbit would be negligible compared to the main source of radiation – the Sun,"" says Jean-Loup Bertaux.  On the down side, the Earth's geocorona could interfere with future astronomical observations performed in the vicinity of the Moon.  ""Space telescopes observing the sky in ultraviolet wavelengths to study the chemical composition of stars and galaxies would need to take this into account,"" adds Jean-Loup.  The power of archives  Launched in December 1995, the SOHO space observatory has been studying the Sun, from its deep core to the outer corona and the solar wind, for over two decades. The satellite orbits around the first Lagrange point (L1), some 1.5 million kilometres from Earth towards the Sun.  This location is a good vantage point to observe the geocorona from outside. SOHO's SWAN instrument imaged Earth and its extended atmosphere on three occasions between 1996 and 1998.  Jean-Loup and Igor's research team in Russia decided to retrieve this data set from the archives for further analysis. These unique views of the whole geocorona as seen from SOHO are now shedding new light on Earth's atmosphere.  ""Data archived many years ago can often be exploited for new science,"" says Bernhard Fleck, ESA SOHO project scientist. ""This discovery highlights the value of data collected over 20 years ago and the exceptional performance of SOHO.""

673f05fa,"Manchin and Capito Introduce Legislation to Improve Early Detection of Black Lung  Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin D-WV and Shelley Moore Capito R-WV introduced legislation to boost participation in federal programs that detect and treat black lung disease among coal miners.  “Coal miners sacrifice a lot, including their own health, to keep our lights on, heat our homes, and power our businesses. Black lung cases are at a 25-year high and with today’s technology and our knowledge of this disease, that is simply unacceptable. Our amendment will make sure more miners participate in early detection so we can catch it and treat it quicker. The health and safety of our miners should always be our number one priority and I will be fighting for this amendment to be included in the final spending bill,” Senator Manchin said.  “West Virginia coal miners have worked tirelessly for decades to keep industries and communities in this country moving,” Senator Capito said. “These resources dedicated to the early detection of black lung could be life-saving for thousands of hardworking West Virginians. Amazing work is being done in this area by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health’s Respiratory Health Division in Morgantown, and I am honored to help that work continue and provide assistance to those who have given so much to our state.”  According to a recent study published in the American Journal of Public Health, cases of black lung are at a 25-year high in Appalachian coal mining states, with as many as one in five underground coal miners in the region having evidence of black lung. In order to address this worsening public health crisis, Senators Manchin and Capito have filed an amendment to the defense, labor, health and education spending package currently under consideration on the floor of the U.S. Senate aiming to improve the participation rate of coal miners in federal health surveillance programs that detect and treat black lung. Specifically, the amendment requires the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to submit a report to Congress on ways to boost outreach efforts to increase participation in the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program CWHSP and to identify barriers that deter miners with black lung from accessing treatment. CWHSP is a national program that offers free health screening services to coal miners, including chest X-rays, lung function testing, respiratory health assessment questionnaires, and extended health surveillance. However, the current national participation rate in CWHSP is approximately 35 percent among active miners and even lower among retirees.  ###",Manchin and Capito Introduce Legislation to Improve Early Detection of Black Lung,true,

The father of Kamala Harris detailed how their ancestors owned slaves.  TRENDING: You Son of a Bitch! YOU PUNK! - Geraldo LOSES IT ON LIVE TV after Dan Bongino Lays Him Out on Hannity! VIDEO  The Democrats have been up in arms about an NBC News report that detailed how Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s great-great-grandfathers owned slaves in Alabama in the 1800s.  Donald Harris, a Stanford University economics professor and father of 2020 Democrat candidate, wrote about how they are descendant of an Irishman who owned a slave plantation in Jamaica in a piece titled “Reflections of a Jamaican Father.”  “My roots go back, within my lifetime, to my paternal grandmother Miss Chrishy née Christiana Brown, descendant of Hamilton Brown who is on record as plantation and slave owner and founder of Brown’s Town,” Mr. Harris wrote in his article for Jamaica Global.  The Free Beacon reports that “a research archive of Jamaican records indicate that at one point in 1817, Hamilton Brown owned scores of slaves. The majority were brought in from Africa, though he also owned many Creole slaves.”  Harris has been pushing for “some form of reparations for black people,” saying that “we have to be honest that people in this country do not start from the same place or have access to the same opportunities.” Something her own family history reflects.  McConnell has responded to the reports about his ancestors by pointing out that the family of former President Barack Obama also owned slaves.  “You know, I find myself once again in the same position as President Obama,” McConnell said. “We both oppose reparations, and we both are the descendants of slaveholders.”",Flashback: Father of Kamala Harris Details on How Their Ancestors Owned Slaves,true,

Official figures released yesterday showed that employment is at a record high, with more than 2,000 people finding work every day.  The workforce has grown to 32.34million – the highest level since records began in 1971, according to the Office for National Statistics. The total has risen by 609,000 since the referendum of June 2016.  Official figures released yesterday showed that employment is at a record high, with more than 2,000 people finding work every day.

The ONS also said the number of European Union citizens working in Britain had gone up since the referendum.  Almost 2.37million had jobs in March – 155,000 more than in early 2016. And workers from outside the EU have risen by 235,000 over the past two years.  Yesterday’s report from the ONS raised hopes that the economic slowdown at the start of this year would be temporary. The economy grew by just 0.1 per cent in the first quarter while output per hour – a key measure of productivity – dropped by 0.5 per cent.  Almost 2.37million had jobs in March – 155,000 more than in early 2016. And workers from outside the EU have risen by 235,000 over the past two years  But Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ‘We can be proud of our record on jobs. The unemployment rate is at its lowest in over 40 years.’  John Longworth, the former head of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘Once again Project Fear has been trounced by the outstanding jobs figures.  ‘At the same time, we see that the German economy has slowed and unemployment remains unacceptably high in many EU countries.’  An extra 3.2million people have joined the workforce since the Tories came to power in coalition in 2010. Four in five men aged between 16 and 64 are now in work, the highest proportion since 1991. Unemployment has dropped to a 43-year low of 4.2 per cent – compared with 8.5 per cent in the eurozone.  Unemployment has dropped to a 43-year low of 4.2 per cent – compared with 8.5 per cent in the eurozone  The total fell by 46,000 over the first three months of the year to 1.42million – 116,000 lower than a year earlier.  An average of 2,189 jobseekers found work every day in the first three months of the year.  John Hawksworth, chief economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: ‘The great British job-creating machine kicked back into life in the first quarter of 2018.  ‘All of this good news stands in marked contrast to the subdued GDP growth of just 0.1 per cent. This estimate could be revised up later. But productivity growth turned negative again after a couple of quarters when it seemed to be perking up. This may reflect the fact that the downturn in output due to the cold weather in the first quarter did not lead to job losses given that it was seen as a purely temporary setback.’  Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said the post-crisis jobs boom in the UK was a big achievement given persistent fears over the threat to jobs from technology and machines.  German growth falls The eurozone economy slowed sharply at the start of the year as Germany and France stumbled, official figures showed yesterday. Output in the single currency bloc rose by 0.4 per cent in the first quarter of the year following a 0.7 per cent increase in the previous three months. The region was held back by Germany and France – the engine rooms of the eurozone. Growth in Germany slowed from 0.6 per cent to 0.3 per cent in the first quarter. At the same time, the pace of expansion in France dropped from 0.7 per cent to 0.3 per cent. The figures, from official statistics agency Eurostat, fuelled fears that the recovery in the eurozone is running out of steam after a solid performance in 2017. And while unemployment in the UK has fallen to a 43-year low of 4.2 per cent, it remains stubbornly high at 8.5 per cent in the eurozone. Peter Vanden Houte, chief economist at banking group ING, said: ‘The weaker first quarter might be the new normal.’ The unemployment rate in France is 8.8 per cent, 11 per cent in Italy and 16.1 per cent in Spain. The average across the advanced world is 5.4 per cent. Advertisement  Esther McVey, the Work and Pensions Secretary, said: ‘Since 2010 we have seen 3.2million more people move into work right across the UK.  ‘Youth unemployment has fallen by over 40 per cent and the unemployment rate at its joint lowest since 1975. Today’s figures once again cement that turnaround, with a new employment rate record of 75.6 per cent, and on average over 1,000 people each and every day, since 2010, getting a job.  ‘With wages growing faster than inflation and increases in the personal tax allowance, not only are more people bringing home a pay packet but they are keeping more of their hard earned money for themselves and their families.’  The Bank of England believes the official growth figure of just 0.1 per cent in the first quarter will be revised up to 0.3 per cent over time.  Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the Ernst & Young Item Club, said: ‘The labour market figures suggests that the economy may not be as weak as some of the recent data suggest. It may fuel hopes that the economy can bounce back after GDP growth slowed in the first quarter.’  The ONS also said wages were rising at the fastest pace for nearly three years as businesses took on more staff.

He rips up problematic streets, raises them with extra dirt and repaves them, installing new drains and giant pumps that can push water back into the bay. The approach has already been shown to work in several neighborhoods. A controversy has erupted about whether Miami Beach is polluting Biscayne Bay with the water, but the city is pushing ahead. Miami Beach plans to spend at least $400 million on its plan by 2018, raising the money through fees imposed on homes and businesses.

bbf4d6a7,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in 2012, on Friday released a copy of his delinquent personal financial disclosure report, a 47-page document showing his wife to be a millionaire with extensive investments held in a family trust.  At a minimum, Ilana Shafran Mandel's holdings are worth $1.95 million. But they could be worth as much as $7.1 million, based on a range of valuations in her husband's financial disclosure report.  Annual income from the trust was at least $860,000 last year and could have been as high as $1.8 million, thanks to dividends, capital gains, rent from real estate and distributions from gas and natural resource partnerships  Mandel's personal financial report was due to the Senate clerk on May 15, little more than a month after he signed candidacy papers on April 5. But he said the complexity and structure of his wife's finances presented questions he needed to resolve in order to file the form correctly. He said the $200 fine he'll have to pay under Senate rules is a fair price for accuracy.  Democrats derided the presumptive GOP Senate nominee for his continued lateness, suggesting he might be hiding something. Keenly aware of the criticism, the Mandel campaign hand-delivered the report to reporters around midday Friday -- yet kept Democrats who wanted to pore over it waiting by choosing to submit it to the Senate via mail. The Senate is likely to receive it early next week.  This frustrated Democratic activists who were waiting for the filing to show up at the Senate clerk's office by the 6 p.m. Friday closing time.  For nearly six months Josh Mandel broke the law and illegally refused to disclose his personal finances despite every other major Senate candidate in the country being in compliance, and now in an effort to continue his evasion tactics, he files a report which is still not yet available to the public on the weekend before the biggest election in the country this year, said Ohio Democratic Party spokesman Justin Barasky.  Based on the copy of the report released to the press, the overwhelming majority of Mandel assets are held for his wife in the JMS Trust -- short for the Joseph M. Shafran Children's Trust. Joseph Shafran is Ilana's father, and his mother -- Ilana's grandmother -- was an immigrant who with her siblings founded a lumber business that grew into Forest City Enterprises. Today, Ilana's trust-held stock in Forest City, a publicly traded company, is worth anywhere from $315,003 to $650,000.  Her other stock holdings through the trust are extensive and include Avon Products, General Electric, J. P. Morgan Chase, McDonalds, Microsoft, Sherwin-Williams and Time Warner. The trust also has an array of bond holdings including Bank of America, the Hamilton County Sewer System, and the Medina County Library. It also is invested in mutual funds, real estate, gas and natural resource partnerships, and a small stake in Wicked People Tour Inc., which Mandel spokesman Joe Aquilino said is related to the Broadway show Wicked.  Mandel, a Marine veteran who expects to challenge Democratic incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown next year, is not personally wealthy. He reported his income as state treasurer as $82,477, and his personal investments are worth as little as $60,000 or as much as $375,000, excluding a Lyndhurst condo he and his wife rent out, valued between $100,001 and $250,000.  Brown, who filed his annual disclosure report in May, has a small range of holdings worth as little as $435,010 or as much as $1 million, based on the ranges of values in his report.","Josh Mandel discloses finances, showing his wife with extensive holdings in a trust",true,
,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for use in children ages five to 11. Pfizer’s clinical trial results indicate the vaccine is safe and effective in this age group.  This is an important development. COVID-19 infections are on the rise in children across Canada.  It is now up to Health Canada to consider the data and to decide whether to authorize this COVID-19 vaccine for children. Once it is authorized in Canada, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) will have to decide whether to recommend vaccination for all children in this age group.  This raises the question of how this decision ought to be made.  Making an ethical decision  As a moral philosopher who has collaboratively researched ethical issues relating to the vaccination of children, I believe it is important to answer this question, for two reasons.  First, whatever the decision, the principles on which it is based — and should be based — must be clear and transparent.  Second, surprisingly little attention has been paid to this issue in Canada, despite the decision to vaccinate children being a matter of science and ethics. Science can clarify some of the costs and benefits of vaccination, but it cannot tell us which costs and benefits matter and when a cost-benefit ratio is favourable.  Fortunately, there is no need to generate a decision-making procedure from scratch. The procedure used by the United Kingdom’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) in deciding whether to vaccinate healthy children aged 12-15 in the U.K. can provide important lessons about what not to do.  Risks and benefits  The most important factor is whether the benefits of vaccination outweigh its risks, and the degree to which the benefits outweigh the risks. In weighing these, the JCVI relied on what it called the “health perspective.”  Reasoning from this perspective, the JCVI held (in a series of public statements) that the chief benefits of vaccination against COVID-19 were the prevention of death, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) or multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).  The chief harms of vaccination were myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart, and pericarditis, inflammation of the thin sack surrounding the heart, though it said these were rare and “typically self-limiting and resolved within a short time.”  The JCVI argued that the benefits of vaccination in this age group are only “marginally greater” than the harms and that therefore vaccination would not be offered to all members of this group.  THE CANADIAN PRESS/Winnipeg Free Press-Mike Deal  NACI disagreed, but did not outline the ethical principles it relied on in recommending vaccination for children ages 12-17.  JCVI’s decision not to offer all children vaccination against COVID-19 was flawed in numerous respects. (It was later overruled by the chief medical officers of the U.K.‘s four nations.) NACI will do well to avoid these mistakes in making its decision about vaccinating children ages five to 11.  The Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Independent SAGE, a group of British scientists offering independent scientific advice on the prevention of COVID-19) has raised a number of concerns about the JCVI’s decision-making process.  One concern is the way in which the JCVI calculated the benefits of vaccination, basing these calculations on risk to the population of all children of death, hospitalization, ICU admission and so on from COVID-19 infection, rather than the risks of these to children with a confirmed infection of COVID-19.  Another concern Independent SAGE raised was that the JCVI did not state which vaccine it considered when it examined the risks, a relevant concern since heart inflammation rates appear to be higher after the Moderna vaccine than after the Pfizer vaccine.  Direct and indirect benefits  Some of JVCI’s other mistakes related to value judgments, relying on the health perspective to make its decision. However, the JCVI was not consistent on what this included.  As noted, the JCVI mentioned the prevention of death, hospitalization, ICU admission and PIMS or MIS-C. These are not the only health benefits of vaccination against COVID-19. Some direct and indirect health benefits of vaccination were not clearly included.  The direct benefits include the prevention of long COVID — a condition affecting anywhere from two to 14 per cent of children infected with COVID-19 — and potential neurological and cognitive deficits caused by COVID-19 infection.  THE CANADIAN PRESS/Nathan Denette  Preventing the negative mental and physical health effects associated with school closures, limits on sporting and other such activities and physical distancing requirements are among the indirect benefits (though these were rightly noted by NACI in its recommendation to vaccinate adolescents). These health effects are important when deciding whether to vaccinate.  These are the known risks and benefits. However, the JCVI’s refusal to recommend vaccination to all children aged 12-15 was due to the uncertainties “regarding the magnitude of the potential harms” of vaccination, including myocarditis.  Although it gave considerable weight to unknown harms or uncertainties of vaccination, the JVCI did not consider potential unknown benefits of vaccination, or uncertainties about benefits. There was no reason to rule these out. Uncertainties about benefits seem to be of as much importance in thinking about the risk benefit profile of COVID-19 vaccination as uncertainties about risks. These, again, matter greatly to this decision.  The JCVI made another ethical error when it said the harms of vaccination should be given greater weight (relatively speaking) than the benefits.  There is no good reason to place a higher relative value on harms compared to benefits. Harms caused by vaccines are not worse than harms caused by COVID-19. It does not appear to be true that the rare and typically mild pericarditis or the myocarditis caused by vaccination is any worse than the pericarditis or the myocarditis caused (at greater frequency) by COVID-19 infection. This is not in line with other treatments considered for children, for which harms are not typically weighed more heavily than benefits.  The well-being perspective  It was a mistake for JCVI to make the decision about vaccination against COVID-19 in children purely on the basis of the health perspective. Health is important. But it is not the only value in the lives of children. Health is a priority because without it many other important benefits — enjoying friends, connecting with relatives, absorbing oneself in homework or music lessons — become much more difficult, if not impossible.  The JCVI mentioned the beneficial effects of vaccination on education. But it did not factor these benefits into the decision relating to vaccinating children against COVID-19.  Educational and other benefits afforded to children by vaccination matter greatly and must be factored into this decision. Moving beyond the health perspective into the well-being perspective encompasses a larger range of benefits and protections from vaccination, including safe and stable learning environments, time with extended family, sport, music performances and the many other things that make life happy and meaningful for children.  When making the decision whether to vaccinate children aged five to 11 against COVID-19, regulators in Canada must rely on both sound science and sound ethics. They must in particular consider all the health and well-being impacts of vaccination more generally; they must consider the uncertain harms and benefits of vaccination; and they must treat benefits and harms symmetrically.  Doing so will show that vaccinating children is, all things considered, beneficial.  Do you have a question about COVID-19 vaccines?

,"(CNN) President Joe Biden hosted Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga at the White House on Friday for his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader as he refocuses American foreign policy toward East Asia.  The meeting between the two leaders came at the end of a pivotal week for the Biden administration's foreign policy, marked by Wednesday's announcement that the President will remove US troops from Afghanistan by September 11 and Thursday's announcement of sanctions on Russia for election interference and cyber attacks. Those moves are a part of the President's desire to shift the country's foreign policy focus to East Asia and counter a rising China.  Biden and Suga said they both aimed to tighten the relationship between the two countries during the daylong visit, and China was one of the biggest focuses of the day's meetings.  ""We committed to working together to take on the challenges from China and on issues like the East China Sea, the South China Sea, as well as North Korea, to ensure the future of a free and open Indo-Pacific,"" Biden said during remarks in the Rose Garden of the White House on Friday.  Suga said he and Biden had ""serious talks on China's influence over the peace and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific, and the world at large.""  ""We agreed to oppose any attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion in the East and South China Seas and intimidation of others in the region,"" Suga said. ""At the same time, we agreed on the necessity for each of us to engage in frank dialogue with China, and in so doing, to pursue stability of international relations, while upholding universal values.""  China sent 25 warplanes into Taiwan's air defense identification zone on Monday, which was the largest breach of that space since the island began regularly reporting such activity in September, Taiwan's Defense Ministry said.  The fact that Suga was the first foreign leader to pay a visit to the White House showed the importance of the relationship between the two countries in promoting democracy in the region, Biden said earlier in the day.  ""As you know, this is the first foreign leader to visit me in my presidency and I'm really pleased to welcome such a close ally and good partner,"" Biden said during a bilateral meeting in the State Dining Room at the White House.  Suga opened his remarks at that meeting by acknowledging the shooting in Indianapolis that left eight people dead overnight, saying through a translator that ""innocent citizens must not be exposed to any such violence.""  The Prime Minister said the two countries have a bond over their shared values and he was looking to ""reaffirm the new and tight bond between us.""  ""I wish to spend time with you to, again, confirm the close ties between our two countries. And thank you again for accepting us,"" Suga said.  During the news conference later in the afternoon, Biden mentioned partnerships with Japan on technology, making sure the technologies are shared and set by democracies, not autocracies, in a nod to China.  ""We're going to work together to prove that democracies can still compete and win in the 21st Century,"" he said.  Suga said during the news conference that the two leaders discussed issues related to Taiwan and Xinjiang during their meetings.  ""As we engaged in an exchange of views over the regional situation, we also discussed the circumstances in Taiwan and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region as well,"" the Prime Minister said, according to a live translation.  ""I refrain from mentioning details since it pertains to diplomatic exchanges, but there is already an agreed recognition over the importance of peace and stability of the Taiwan strait between Japan and the United States, which was reaffirmed on this occasion. I also explained Japan's position and initiatives regarding the situation in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to the President, who I think understood my points,"" he added.  The two leaders also discussed North Korea, as the US is nearing the conclusion of its North Korea policy review.  While Japan has been consulted throughout the process, the two leaders had an opportunity to ""put the finishing touches on what is an important initiative for the United States,"" a senior official said ahead of the meeting.  National security adviser Jake Sullivan recently met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Annapolis, Maryland, in order to discuss the administration's North Korea policy review. The review included extensive consultations with members of the Trump administration about diplomatic engagements with North Korea.  ""The United States can only be effective in Asia when the US-Japan relationship is strong and Japan is steady and stable,"" the official said.

,"Warning: The below content is not appropriate for children. Please check with an adult before you read this page. To go back to the children’s page, please click here.  This isn’t an easy piece to write, for reasons that will shortly become clear, but I know it’s time to explain myself on an issue surrounded by toxicity. I write this without any desire to add to that toxicity.  For people who don’t know: last December I tweeted my support for Maya Forstater, a tax specialist who’d lost her job for what were deemed ‘transphobic’ tweets. She took her case to an employment tribunal, asking the judge to rule on whether a philosophical belief that sex is determined by biology is protected in law. Judge Tayler ruled that it wasn’t.  My interest in trans issues pre-dated Maya’s case by almost two years, during which I followed the debate around the concept of gender identity closely. I’ve met trans people, and read sundry books, blogs and articles by trans people, gender specialists, intersex people, psychologists, safeguarding experts, social workers and doctors, and followed the discourse online and in traditional media. On one level, my interest in this issue has been professional, because I’m writing a crime series, set in the present day, and my fictional female detective is of an age to be interested in, and affected by, these issues herself, but on another, it’s intensely personal, as I’m about to explain.  All the time I’ve been researching and learning, accusations and threats from trans activists have been bubbling in my Twitter timeline. This was initially triggered by a ‘like’. When I started taking an interest in gender identity and transgender matters, I began screenshotting comments that interested me, as a way of reminding myself what I might want to research later. On one occasion, I absent-mindedly ‘liked’ instead of screenshotting. That single ‘like’ was deemed evidence of wrongthink, and a persistent low level of harassment began.  Months later, I compounded my accidental ‘like’ crime by following Magdalen Berns on Twitter. Magdalen was an immensely brave young feminist and lesbian who was dying of an aggressive brain tumour. I followed her because I wanted to contact her directly, which I succeeded in doing. However, as Magdalen was a great believer in the importance of biological sex, and didn’t believe lesbians should be called bigots for not dating trans women with penises, dots were joined in the heads of twitter trans activists, and the level of social media abuse increased.  I mention all this only to explain that I knew perfectly well what was going to happen when I supported Maya. I must have been on my fourth or fifth cancellation by then. I expected the threats of violence, to be told I was literally killing trans people with my hate, to be called cunt and bitch and, of course, for my books to be burned, although one particularly abusive man told me he’d composted them.  What I didn’t expect in the aftermath of my cancellation was the avalanche of emails and letters that came showering down upon me, the overwhelming majority of which were positive, grateful and supportive. They came from a cross-section of kind, empathetic and intelligent people, some of them working in fields dealing with gender dysphoria and trans people, who’re all deeply concerned about the way a socio-political concept is influencing politics, medical practice and safeguarding. They’re worried about the dangers to young people, gay people and about the erosion of women’s and girl’s rights. Above all, they’re worried about a climate of fear that serves nobody – least of all trans youth – well.  I’d stepped back from Twitter for many months both before and after tweeting support for Maya, because I knew it was doing nothing good for my mental health. I only returned because I wanted to share a free children’s book during the pandemic. Immediately, activists who clearly believe themselves to be good, kind and progressive people swarmed back into my timeline, assuming a right to police my speech, accuse me of hatred, call me misogynistic slurs and, above all – as every woman involved in this debate will know – TERF.  If you didn’t already know – and why should you? – ‘TERF’ is an acronym coined by trans activists, which stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist. In practice, a huge and diverse cross-section of women are currently being called TERFs and the vast majority have never been radical feminists. Examples of so-called TERFs range from the mother of a gay child who was afraid their child wanted to transition to escape homophobic bullying, to a hitherto totally unfeminist older lady who’s vowed never to visit Marks & Spencer again because they’re allowing any man who says they identify as a woman into the women’s changing rooms. Ironically, radical feminists aren’t even trans-exclusionary – they include trans men in their feminism, because they were born women.  But accusations of TERFery have been sufficient to intimidate many people, institutions and organisations I once admired, who’re cowering before the tactics of the playground. ‘They’ll call us transphobic!’ ‘They’ll say I hate trans people!’ What next, they’ll say you’ve got fleas? Speaking as a biological woman, a lot of people in positions of power really need to grow a pair (which is doubtless literally possible, according to the kind of people who argue that clownfish prove humans aren’t a dimorphic species).  So why am I doing this? Why speak up? Why not quietly do my research and keep my head down?  Well, I’ve got five reasons for being worried about the new trans activism, and deciding I need to speak up.  Firstly, I have a charitable trust that focuses on alleviating social deprivation in Scotland, with a particular emphasis on women and children. Among other things, my trust supports projects for female prisoners and for survivors of domestic and sexual abuse. I also fund medical research into MS, a disease that behaves very differently in men and women. It’s been clear to me for a while that the new trans activism is having (or is likely to have, if all its demands are met) a significant impact on many of the causes I support, because it’s pushing to erode the legal definition of sex and replace it with gender.  The second reason is that I’m an ex-teacher and the founder of a children’s charity, which gives me an interest in both education and safeguarding. Like many others, I have deep concerns about the effect the trans rights movement is having on both.  The third is that, as a much-banned author, I’m interested in freedom of speech and have publicly defended it, even unto Donald Trump.  The fourth is where things start to get truly personal. I’m concerned about the huge explosion in young women wishing to transition and also about the increasing numbers who seem to be detransitioning (returning to their original sex), because they regret taking steps that have, in some cases, altered their bodies irrevocably, and taken away their fertility. Some say they decided to transition after realising they were same-sex attracted, and that transitioning was partly driven by homophobia, either in society or in their families.  Most people probably aren’t aware – I certainly wasn’t, until I started researching this issue properly – that ten years ago, the majority of people wanting to transition to the opposite sex were male. That ratio has now reversed. The UK has experienced a 4400% increase in girls being referred for transitioning treatment. Autistic girls are hugely overrepresented in their numbers.  The same phenomenon has been seen in the US. In 2018, American physician and researcher Lisa Littman set out to explore it. In an interview, she said:  ‘Parents online were describing a very unusual pattern of transgender-identification where multiple friends and even entire friend groups became transgender-identified at the same time. I would have been remiss had I not considered social contagion and peer influences as potential factors.’  Littman mentioned Tumblr, Reddit, Instagram and YouTube as contributing factors to Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria, where she believes that in the realm of transgender identification ‘youth have created particularly insular echo chambers.’  Her paper caused a furore. She was accused of bias and of spreading misinformation about transgender people, subjected to a tsunami of abuse and a concerted campaign to discredit both her and her work. The journal took the paper offline and re-reviewed it before republishing it. However, her career took a similar hit to that suffered by Maya Forstater. Lisa Littman had dared challenge one of the central tenets of trans activism, which is that a person’s gender identity is innate, like sexual orientation. Nobody, the activists insisted, could ever be persuaded into being trans.  The argument of many current trans activists is that if you don’t let a gender dysphoric teenager transition, they will kill themselves. In an article explaining why he resigned from the Tavistock (an NHS gender clinic in England) psychiatrist Marcus Evans stated that claims that children will kill themselves if not permitted to transition do not ‘align substantially with any robust data or studies in this area. Nor do they align with the cases I have encountered over decades as a psychotherapist.’  The writings of young trans men reveal a group of notably sensitive and clever people. The more of their accounts of gender dysphoria I’ve read, with their insightful descriptions of anxiety, dissociation, eating disorders, self-harm and self-hatred, the more I’ve wondered whether, if I’d been born 30 years later, I too might have tried to transition. The allure of escaping womanhood would have been huge. I struggled with severe OCD as a teenager. If I’d found community and sympathy online that I couldn’t find in my immediate environment, I believe I could have been persuaded to turn myself into the son my father had openly said he’d have preferred.  When I read about the theory of gender identity, I remember how mentally sexless I felt in youth. I remember Colette’s description of herself as a ‘mental hermaphrodite’ and Simone de Beauvoir’s words: ‘It is perfectly natural for the future woman to feel indignant at the limitations posed upon her by her sex. The real question is not why she should reject them: the problem is rather to understand why she accepts them.’  As I didn’t have a realistic possibility of becoming a man back in the 1980s, it had to be books and music that got me through both my mental health issues and the sexualised scrutiny and judgement that sets so many girls to war against their bodies in their teens. Fortunately for me, I found my own sense of otherness, and my ambivalence about being a woman, reflected in the work of female writers and musicians who reassured me that, in spite of everything a sexist world tries to throw at the female-bodied, it’s fine not to feel pink, frilly and compliant inside your own head; it’s OK to feel confused, dark, both sexual and non-sexual, unsure of what or who you are.  I want to be very clear here: I know transition will be a solution for some gender dysphoric people, although I’m also aware through extensive research that studies have consistently shown that between 60-90% of gender dysphoric teens will grow out of their dysphoria. Again and again I’ve been told to ‘just meet some trans people.’ I have: in addition to a few younger people, who were all adorable, I happen to know a self-described transsexual woman who’s older than I am and wonderful. Although she’s open about her past as a gay man, I’ve always found it hard to think of her as anything other than a woman, and I believe (and certainly hope) she’s completely happy to have transitioned. Being older, though, she went through a long and rigorous process of evaluation, psychotherapy and staged transformation. The current explosion of trans activism is urging a removal of almost all the robust systems through which candidates for sex reassignment were once required to pass. A man who intends to have no surgery and take no hormones may now secure himself a Gender Recognition Certificate and be a woman in the sight of the law. Many people aren’t aware of this.  We’re living through the most misogynistic period I’ve experienced. Back in the 80s, I imagined that my future daughters, should I have any, would have it far better than I ever did, but between the backlash against feminism and a porn-saturated online culture, I believe things have got significantly worse for girls. Never have I seen women denigrated and dehumanised to the extent they are now. From the leader of the free world’s long history of sexual assault accusations and his proud boast of ‘grabbing them by the pussy’, to the incel (‘involuntarily celibate’) movement that rages against women who won’t give them sex, to the trans activists who declare that TERFs need punching and re-educating, men across the political spectrum seem to agree: women are asking for trouble. Everywhere, women are being told to shut up and sit down, or else.  I’ve read all the arguments about femaleness not residing in the sexed body, and the assertions that biological women don’t have common experiences, and I find them, too, deeply misogynistic and regressive. It’s also clear that one of the objectives of denying the importance of sex is to erode what some seem to see as the cruelly segregationist idea of women having their own biological realities or – just as threatening – unifying realities that make them a cohesive political class. The hundreds of emails I’ve received in the last few days prove this erosion concerns many others just as much. It isn’t enough for women to be trans allies. Women must accept and admit that there is no material difference between trans women and themselves.  But, as many women have said before me, ‘woman’ is not a costume. ‘Woman’ is not an idea in a man’s head. ‘Woman’ is not a pink brain, a liking for Jimmy Choos or any of the other sexist ideas now somehow touted as progressive. Moreover, the ‘inclusive’ language that calls female people ‘menstruators’ and ‘people with vulvas’ strikes many women as dehumanising and demeaning. I understand why trans activists consider this language to be appropriate and kind, but for those of us who’ve had degrading slurs spat at us by violent men, it’s not neutral, it’s hostile and alienating.  Which brings me to the fifth reason I’m deeply concerned about the consequences of the current trans activism.  I’ve been in the public eye now for over twenty years and have never talked publicly about being a domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor. This isn’t because I’m ashamed those things happened to me, but because they’re traumatic to revisit and remember. I also feel protective of my daughter from my first marriage. I didn’t want to claim sole ownership of a story that belongs to her, too. However, a short while ago, I asked her how she’d feel if I were publicly honest about that part of my life, and she encouraged me to go ahead.  I’m mentioning these things now not in an attempt to garner sympathy, but out of solidarity with the huge numbers of women who have histories like mine, who’ve been slurred as bigots for having concerns around single-sex spaces.  I managed to escape my first violent marriage with some difficulty, but I’m now married to a truly good and principled man, safe and secure in ways I never in a million years expected to be. However, the scars left by violence and sexual assault don’t disappear, no matter how loved you are, and no matter how much money you’ve made. My perennial jumpiness is a family joke – and even I know it’s funny – but I pray my daughters never have the same reasons I do for hating sudden loud noises, or finding people behind me when I haven’t heard them approaching.  If you could come inside my head and understand what I feel when I read about a trans woman dying at the hands of a violent man, you’d find solidarity and kinship. I have a visceral sense of the terror in which those trans women will have spent their last seconds on earth, because I too have known moments of blind fear when I realised that the only thing keeping me alive was the shaky self-restraint of my attacker.  I believe the majority of trans-identified people not only pose zero threat to others, but are vulnerable for all the reasons I’ve outlined. Trans people need and deserve protection. Like women, they’re most likely to be killed by sexual partners. Trans women who work in the sex industry, particularly trans women of colour, are at particular risk. Like every other domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor I know, I feel nothing but empathy and solidarity with trans women who’ve been abused by men.  So I want trans women to be safe. At the same time, I do not want to make natal girls and women less safe. When you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms to any man who believes or feels he’s a woman – and, as I’ve said, gender confirmation certificates may now be granted without any need for surgery or hormones – then you open the door to any and all men who wish to come inside. That is the simple truth.  On Saturday morning, I read that the Scottish government is proceeding with its controversial gender recognition plans, which will in effect mean that all a man needs to ‘become a woman’ is to say he’s one. To use a very contemporary word, I was ‘triggered’. Ground down by the relentless attacks from trans activists on social media, when I was only there to give children feedback about pictures they’d drawn for my book under lockdown, I spent much of Saturday in a very dark place inside my head, as memories of a serious sexual assault I suffered in my twenties recurred on a loop. That assault happened at a time and in a space where I was vulnerable, and a man capitalised on an opportunity. I couldn’t shut out those memories and I was finding it hard to contain my anger and disappointment about the way I believe my government is playing fast and loose with womens and girls’ safety.  Late on Saturday evening, scrolling through children’s pictures before I went to bed, I forgot the first rule of Twitter – never, ever expect a nuanced conversation – and reacted to what I felt was degrading language about women. I spoke up about the importance of sex and have been paying the price ever since. I was transphobic, I was a cunt, a bitch, a TERF, I deserved cancelling, punching and death. You are Voldemort said one person, clearly feeling this was the only language I’d understand.  It would be so much easier to tweet the approved hashtags – because of course trans rights are human rights and of course trans lives matter – scoop up the woke cookies and bask in a virtue-signalling afterglow. There’s joy, relief and safety in conformity. As Simone de Beauvoir also wrote, “… without a doubt it is more comfortable to endure blind bondage than to work for one’s liberation; the dead, too, are better suited to the earth than the living.”  Huge numbers of women are justifiably terrified by the trans activists; I know this because so many have got in touch with me to tell their stories. They’re afraid of doxxing, of losing their jobs or their livelihoods, and of violence.  But endlessly unpleasant as its constant targeting of me has been, I refuse to bow down to a movement that I believe is doing demonstrable harm in seeking to erode ‘woman’ as a political and biological class and offering cover to predators like few before it. I stand alongside the brave women and men, gay, straight and trans, who’re standing up for freedom of speech and thought, and for the rights and safety of some of the most vulnerable in our society: young gay kids, fragile teenagers, and women who’re reliant on and wish to retain their single sex spaces. Polls show those women are in the vast majority, and exclude only those privileged or lucky enough never to have come up against male violence or sexual assault, and who’ve never troubled to educate themselves on how prevalent it is.  The one thing that gives me hope is that the women who can protest and organise, are doing so, and they have some truly decent men and trans people alongside them. Political parties seeking to appease the loudest voices in this debate are ignoring women’s concerns at their peril. In the UK, women are reaching out to each other across party lines, concerned about the erosion of their hard-won rights and widespread intimidation. None of the gender critical women I’ve talked to hates trans people; on the contrary. Many of them became interested in this issue in the first place out of concern for trans youth, and they’re hugely sympathetic towards trans adults who simply want to live their lives, but who’re facing a backlash for a brand of activism they don’t endorse. The supreme irony is that the attempt to silence women with the word ‘TERF’ may have pushed more young women towards radical feminism than the movement’s seen in decades.  The last thing I want to say is this. I haven’t written this essay in the hope that anybody will get out a violin for me, not even a teeny-weeny one. I’m extraordinarily fortunate; I’m a survivor, certainly not a victim. I’ve only mentioned my past because, like every other human being on this planet, I have a complex backstory, which shapes my fears, my interests and my opinions. I never forget that inner complexity when I’m creating a fictional character and I certainly never forget it when it comes to trans people.  All I’m asking – all I want – is for similar empathy, similar understanding, to be extended to the many millions of women whose sole crime is wanting their concerns to be heard without receiving threats and abuse.",J.K.

,"The government’s top Great Barrier Reef scientist says a third mass bleaching event in five years is a clear signal the marine wonder is “calling for urgent help” on climate change.  One quarter of the Great Barrier Reef suffered severe bleaching this summer in the most widespread outbreak ever witnessed, according to analysis of aerial surveys of more than 1,000 individual reefs released on Tuesday.  Dr David Wachenfeld, chief scientist at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, told Guardian Australia: “My greatest fear is that people will lose hope for the reef. Without hope there’s no action.  “People need to see these [bleaching] events not as depressing bits of news that adds to other depressing bits of news. They are clear signals the Great Barrier Reef is calling for urgent help and for us to do everything we can.”  Prof Terry Hughes, director of the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, surveyed 1,036 reefs from a plane over nine days in late March. The marine park authority also had an observer on the flights.  Hughes has released maps showing severe levels of bleaching occurred in 2020 in all three sections of the reef – northern, central and southern – the first time this has happened since mass bleaching was first seen in 1998.  A coral bleaching map showing the worst affected areas in 2020 highlighted in red. Photograph: ARC Centre for Excellence in Coral Reef Studies  A bleaching map showing the worst affected areas in 2016-17. Photograph: ARC Centre for Excellence in Coral Reef Studies  Some 25% of the reefs were severely bleached – meaning that more than 60% of the corals on each reef had bleached.  Hughes said previous observations had shown that bleaching at that extent leads to “high levels of mortality” of corals.  The Great Barrier Reef has experienced five mass bleaching events – 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2020 – all caused by rising ocean temperatures driven by global heating.  Hughes said there probably would not be the same level of coral death in the north and central regions in 2020 as in previous years, but this was partly because previous bleaching outbreaks had killed off the less heat-tolerant species.  The 2020 bleaching was second only to 2016 for severity, Hughes said.  Corals can recover from mild bleaching, but scientists say those corals are more susceptible to disease. Severe bleaching can kill corals.  Hughes said severe mass bleaching had never before hit the southern section of the reef – from Mackay south. That area had high numbers of heat-sensitive corals that “light up like a Christmas tree” when viewed from the air.  “It’s not too late to turn this around with rapid action on emissions,” he said. “But business-as-usual emissions will make the the Great Barrier Reef a pretty miserable place compared to today.”  In February the reef was subjected to its hottest sea surface temperatures since records began in 1900.  Some scientists fear that rising levels of heat being taken up by the ocean have pushed tropical reefs to a tipping point at which many locations bleach almost annually.  Wachenfeld said the reef’s sheer size – it comprises about 3,000 individual reefs – made it resilient, “but climate change brings a new scale of impact unlike anything we have seen before”.  He told Guardian Australia: “Three mass bleaching events in five years is showing us the enormous scale at which climate change can operate.  “No one climate event will kill the Great Barrier Reef, but each successive event creates more damage. Its resilience is not limitless and we need the strongest possible action on climate change.”  The globe has already warmed by about 1C above pre-industrial levels, caused primarily by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels.  Wachenfeld said: “We’re at about 1C and we have just had three marine heatwaves in five years that have all damaged the reef.”  Measures to improve the resilience of the reef include improving water quality, controlling outbreaks of coral-eating starfish, and research and development to improve the heat tolerance of corals.  “None of that is a substitute for strong action on emissions,” Wachenfeld said. “Dealing with the climate problem is the underpinning for everything else to work.”  Under the Paris climate agreement, countries agreed to deliver country-wide plans that would keep global heating well below 2C, with an aim to keep temperatures to 1.5C.  “That’s the window we have to aim for,” Wachenfeld said.  “As we approach and go beyond 2C, I don’t see the tools we have today, and the tools that research and development is working on, will protect the reef.  “The world is heading for 3C of warming – we will not be able to protect coral reefs under those circumstances.  “The reef is, after this event, a more damaged ecosystem, but it can still recover. It needs more help from us and it needs it urgently. This is a call to action.”  In a statement to Guardian Australia, the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said: “It is deeply concerning the reef has suffered another bleaching event and our focus has to be on the ways that we can reduce the pressure on the reef and strengthen its resilience.  “The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has been monitoring the situation closely and highlighting the concerns over temperatures.  “Thankfully, some of the most recognised tourism areas have been less impacted but that does not change the importance of the issue and the importance of coordinated global action on emissions reduction to reduce ocean temperatures.”  Queensland’s minister for environment and the Great Barrier Reef, Leeanne Enoch, said climate change, pollution from run-off and other threats “are testing the reef’s ability to recover from major disturbances like mass bleaching events, severe tropical cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish.”  She said the Palaszczuk government had “committed to a zero net emissions target by 2050” and allocated more than $427m for reef protection and resilience between 2015 and 2022.  “The missing piece continues to be leadership and action from the federal government on climate change,” she said.",Great Barrier Reef's third mass bleaching in five years the most widespread yet,true,233238683355028709590047045417625638315
,"You might have missed it amid all the sound and fury of impeachment, but it’s been a busy week for disinformation. Twitter, the Wall Street Journal reports, will start removing posts that it determines are “misleading about an election.” Elizabeth Warren’s campaign rolled out a plan on “Fighting Digital Disinformation,” including a pledge not to “knowingly use or spread false or manipulated information.” And the House Ethics Committee announced that members of the House of Representatives who share deepfakes on social media might face sanctions from the House itself. The ethics announcement attracted the least attention of all, but it’s actually an important step in creating standards for how elected representatives should use social media.  This news might seem trivial compared to the drama of the impeachment trial going on just down the street. But as technology companies and governments alike grapple with how to address the spread of online falsehoods, the committee’s memo is noteworthy. Four years after the shock to the system of 2016, everyone agrees that disinformation and misinformation are problems that need to be dealt with, but the question remains who is best positioned to accept responsibility. The House of Representatives appears to be, in some small way, beginning to take on the task.  The committee’s “pink sheet”—an advisory memorandum on House rules—alerts members of the House to the dangers of posting deepfakes on social media, warning that “manipulation of images and videos that are intended to mislead the public can harm … discourse and reflect discreditably on the House.” For this reason, disseminating “deep fakes or other audio-visual distortions intended to mislead the public” could violate the House’s Code of Official Conduct, which governs the behavior of the chamber’s members and employees.  This might sound like the committee is addressing a problem that doesn’t exist yet. As far as we know, there have not been any cases in which a member of Congress—or any other prominent American political figure—has tweeted a genuine deepfake, meaning doctored audio or video generated through machine learning than can produce extremely lifelike and misleading results. After all, deepfakes—though concerning—just aren’t all that common in politics (yet).  Politicians have, however, published plenty of what the memorandum describes as “other audio-visual distortions”—that is, photos or video deceptively manipulated in a less sophisticated manner than a deepfake. Sometimes the manipulation is obvious: President Trump recently tweeted a picture altered to depict him putting a Medal of Honor around the neck of a dog that played a role in the raid on Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (the original photo showed the president bestowing the medal to a Vietnam War medic). But U.S. political figures have published more deceptive images, too. Three days after the strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, Rep. Paul Gosar tweeted a photo appearing to show President Obama shaking hands with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani; it took 40 minutes before he acknowledged that the picture was actually a fake, a doctored version of a shot from a 2011 meeting between Obama and then-Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.  The world is a better place without these guys in power. pic.twitter.com/gDoXQu9vO5 — Paul Gosar (@DrPaulGosar) January 6, 2020  It’s easy to see why the committee might be particularly concerned about these manipulations now. Quoting a Congressional Research Service article on deepfakes, the memo warns that when members of the House or their staff tweet or share deepfakes or other manipulated audio or video, they could “erode public trust, negatively affect public discourse, or even sway an election.” Consider, for example, the misleadingly edited video tweeted out by President Trump in May 2019 that appeared to display Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi slurring her words at a news conference—or the wide circulation of a deceptive clip that seemed to show Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden make a racist remark. Now imagine such a clip, with sophisticated editing or not, circulated in the days or even hours before an election—and given the appearance of legitimacy by retweets from members of Congress and perhaps even the president himself.  The memo changes the calculation for members: Tweet misleading content, and you could be subject to House disciplinary rules. The Ethics Committee asks members and staff to think before they tweet: Before posting on social media, “[m]embers and staff are expected to take reasonable efforts to consider whether such representations are deep fakes or are intentionally distorted to mislead the public.” Members who break this guidance could be subject to public admonition by the committee of the offending members. Technically, the full House could even censure members—or expel them for violation of House rules.  Censure is unlikely, though, and expulsion even less so. Only five members have ever met the latter fate, three of whom were expelled for fighting for the Confederacy. Tweeting a deepfake may be harmful to democracy, but it might not be quite the same as taking up arms against the republic.  More realistically, the committee may hope that the guideline itself will have a deterrent effect. The committee is often reluctant to discipline members, so the most realistic deterrent may come from members’ desire to avoid scrutiny from the Office of Congressional Ethics, which investigates and produces public reports about ethics violations. As former senior counsel to the House Michael L. Stern, told us, “[T]he primary motivation for complying with this edict is not the formal sanction, but the embarrassment of getting called out for violations, as well as the desire to avoid an investigation” by either the committee or the independent Office of Congressional Ethics.  In this way, the pink sheet is a norm-setting exercise for the House—and a bipartisan one, as the committee is the only one in the House evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. When members tweet doctored pictures or share altered videos, they now do so as knowing violators of the House’s position on this type of content.  So the guidelines set out in the memo might not have that much bite. Yet they still represent a shift from the current state of things—which is to say, an ad hoc system in which tech platforms are effectively building the content moderation plane in midair, setting out broad rules and then struggling to decide the extent to which politicians get special treatment. The result of these efforts has been that, by and large, citizens and users of the major platforms have come to think of the platforms themselves as the governing bodies to whom appeals should be addressed when a prominent political figure publishes misleading or objectionable content. Every time President Trump posts a threat on Twitter, for example, hundreds of other users will tweet at Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and other executives demanding to know why the platform won’t remove content that appears to violate its terms of service.  Hey @Twitter, is threatening nuclear war not a violation of terms of service? https://t.co/Gwz2EZHKnu — Kal Penn (@kalpenn) August 11, 2017  The situation has become so commonplace that it may no longer seem strange. But there is something bizarre about the notion that private platforms not only can regulate what and how politicians communicate with their constituents and the rest of the world, but that those platforms should. As any number of scholars and journalists have pointed out, the responsibility of deciding what speech is and is not within the bounds of acceptable discourse is, on its face, a task better suited to democratic governance than private enterprise. The Ethics Committee guidance is a small step toward governmental institutions accepting at least some of that burden.  That said, the House shouldering part of that weight means that the chamber will now have to grapple with some of the puzzling content moderation questions that only platforms have dealt with until now. Just as Twitter or Facebook users whose content is removed will appeal to the platforms to argue that their posts don’t violate the terms of service, surely the Ethics Committee and the Office of Congressional Ethics are going to be faced with the problem of assessing whether a member or staffer has actually violated the rule. Recall that the memo’s prohibition includes an intent requirement—so a member who shares a deepfake could argue that he or she too was duped, or explain that the shared deepfake was not a deception, but merely a joke. In fact, after he published the fake image of Obama shaking hands with Rouhani, that’s exactly what Gosar did: “[N]o one said this wasn’t photoshopped. No one said the president of Iran was dead. No one said Obama met with Rouhani in person,” Gosar wrote.  Then there are the new questions that emerge from two sets of overlapping rules between the House and the platforms, which will create headaches for both parties. Platforms are likely to face two situations: those in which a member spreads misleading content that appears to violate the terms of the memo and the House does nothing, and those in which the House issues some sort of sanction.  In the first case, where a member spreads misleading content but the committee takes no action, there will no doubt still be calls—as there are every time something similar happens—for platforms to do something. These calls are natural: Platforms have the greatest capacity to stop the spread of content on their services by using their content moderation infrastructure, and so it feels like they should exercise it. But, as noted above, it is jarring to ask a private company, with no democratic mandate or legitimacy, to take action against the speech of a public representative when the House Committee on Ethics itself has not done so. This situation appears to be a lose-lose for platforms: Take no action and they will continue to face charges of negligence in their roles at gatekeepers; do something and they will appear to be usurping the role of the committee to police the boundaries of acceptable conduct by elected representatives.  The second case isn’t easy either. Where a particular post has resulted in sanction from the committee, what should platforms do to best facilitate democratic accountability? Continuing to allow false content to spread might allow it to continue to do harm. But removing a post by a representative could prevent constituents from holding their member of Congress accountable, because fewer people will be aware of the post in the first place.  This situation calls for thinking outside the binary of taking down content or leaving it up, which platforms are starting to show in other cases—like flagging content that has been rated false by fact-checkers, or Twitter’s (as yet unused) policy of placing warning screens on content that breaks its rules but is in the public interest. When it comes to deepfakes and other “synthetic and manipulated media,” for example, Twitter has proposed placing a notice next to such posts or adding some other kind of warning, which could mesh well with whatever action the committee takes. Similarly, platforms could reduce circulation of misleading content that is the subject of committee censure and add context noting the committee’s action.  And, as ever, there’s the little matter of what to do about the president. The Ethics Committee can pass whatever rules it likes for members, but that’s not going to stop Trump from tweeting and retweeting. What happens if, for example, members of the House retweet a Trump tweet containing a misleadingly edited video? The members might be censured while the president would remain untouched.  Then again, perhaps this mirrors the struggles of Twitter itself: Puzzled by how to handle presidential tweets, the platform has written into its terms of service an exception for “newsworthiness,” which essentially allows Trump to publish whatever he likes. (Other platforms have similar rules.) Of course, the House has no power over Trump’s Twitter feed, and while the platform could limit his tweets if it wanted, it has decided not to.  The Ethics Committee is now going to get a taste of the absurdities and contradictions of regulating social media. We’ll have to wait and see whether Twitter users start tweeting at the committee as well as @jack and asking that congressional tweets be taken down—or demanding to know why members have been unjustly punished.",Members of the House Are on Notice: No Tweeting Deepfakes,true,241539950659389993784110406277708524347
,"CBC News has obtained an unredacted copy of a lawsuit launched by an anti-vaccination advocacy group against the government response to the coronavirus crisis, the details of which can now be independently verified and publicly reported for the first time.  The lawsuit was filed July 6 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Toronto by Aylmer, Ont.-based Vaccine Choice Canada and seven individuals. The legal action is a challenge under Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms to the country's pandemic response measures, including compulsory face masks, the closure of businesses and the enforcement of physical distancing.  The plaintiffs are suing the governments of Canada and Ontario, the City of Toronto, senior politicians, a number of local Ontario health authorities, health officials and the CBC over their response to the pandemic.  The suit states that the closure of businesses to prevent the spread of the virus was ""extreme, unwarranted and unjustified,"" that self-isolation measures imposed on individuals were ""not scientific, nor medically based nor proven"" and that the mandatory wearing of face coverings in some public spaces imposes ""physical and psychological harm.""  The lawsuit alleges that the measures violate Sections 2 (right of association), 7 (life, liberty and security of the person), 8 (unlawful search and seizure), 9 (arbitrary detention of enforcement officers) and 15 (equality before and under the law) of the charter.  ""The measures ... are further not in accordance with the tenets of fundamental justice in their overbreadth, nor are they justified under S.1 of the charter in that they are demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society,"" the lawsuit states.  Vaccine Choice Canada describes itself as a watchdog organization whose mandate is ""to empower families to make educated, voluntary, and informed decisions about vaccination,"" but public health authorities have criticized the group for spreading false or misleading information about vaccines and immunization.  Names of plaintiffs redacted for fear of harassment  While copies of the 191-page statement of claim exist online, the names and stories of some of the individual plaintiffs have been redacted on the documents by the plaintiffs themselves. Social media posts from Rocco Galati, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said it was done out of precaution to protect the individuals from harassment.  Here is the statement of claim filed in Ontario Superior Court.<a href=""https://t.co/rULDUrXdQe"">https://t.co/rULDUrXdQe</a><br><br>Some of the plaintiffs' names have been redacted to protect them from harassment. —@roccogalatilaw  CBC News has agreed not to name the individuals, who range from a former professor to working parents, a chiropractor and people living with chronic illnesses or disabilities.  No date has been set for when the case will go to court, and it's unclear whether a judge will allow it to proceed.  The lawsuit is seeking $1 million in general damages and $10 million in punitive damages, plus legal costs.  No statements of defence have been filed in the case.  Legal scholar says lawsuit has claims worth examining  Among the personal stories contained in the statement of claim is that of a 23-year-old Hamilton man with autism who has the emotional capacity of a four-year-old. His guardian claims in the suit that the man doesn't have the capacity to understand pandemic health measures, which have ""totally mentally devastated"" him by depriving him of his routines and his social and emotional network.  Another account is of a Mississauga woman who says she can't wear a mask because it triggers a traumatic memory of having a mask forcibly held over her face during a sexual assault.  Protesters gather outside the Ontario Legislature in Toronto in May to demonstrate against government actions related to the coronavirus pandemic. (Chris Young/The Canadian Press)  The claim states the woman is often faced with a choice when she goes out in public without a mask: risk being embarrassed by disclosing her private history or be denied service at local businesses.  ""I don't think we need to violate people's privacy or have them disclose medical conditions, particularly in the context of a private business,"" said Jacob Shelley, an assistant professor of health law and ethics at Western University in London, Ont., who examined an unredacted copy of the lawsuit provided by CBC News.  ""We need to have a discussion about what does it mean to mandate masks. What does it mean to have everyone wear masks when you're indoors and you can't socially distance, because I think there are going to be legitimate instances where people are going to be unable or unwilling to wear a mask for reasons that really are their own.  ""There's lucid, valid, potential issues that maybe are worth being adjudicated before the court.""  A sign encouraging physical distancing at Union Station in Toronto. The City of Toronto is one of the parties named in the suit. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)  Shelley said given the content of the lawsuit, a public debate over masks risks being overshadowed by other claims that aren't supported by science.  ""The 'pandemic' is false, and the measures phony, designed and implemented for improper and ulterior purposes, at the behest of the WHO, controlled and directed by billionaire, corporate oligarchs,"" the statement of claim says.  ""The plaintiffs state, and the fact is, that the evidence is that far many more people have died as a result of the 'pandemic' measures themselves than purportedly from the 'COVID-19 deaths,' even if one takes the deaths 'caused' by COVID as a given.""  A sign put up by Ottawa public health authorities specifying mask rules and who is exempt from them. The lawsuit alleges that measures such as mandatory mask-wearing are 'extreme, unwarranted and unjustified' and some may even impose 'physical and psychological harm.' (Kate Porter/CBC)  Other lawsuit claims  Other claims made in the lawsuit are unrelated to the coronavirus pandemic.  ""Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology report the development of a novel way to record a patient's vaccination history by using smartphone-readable nano crystals called 'quantum dots,' embedded in the skin using micro-needles. In short, a vaccine chip embedded in the body. This work and research are funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,"" the lawsuit said.  The statement of claim includes a timeline that begins in the year 2000 when Bill Gates steps down as the head of Microsoft to start the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It also states Gates expects a ""'twenty-fold' return on his $10 billion vaccine investment within the next few decades.""  Included in the timeline are references to the Chinese military, 5G networks, international vaccine programs and the Rockefeller Foundation as relevant to the creation and spread of the coronavirus, but the lawsuit isn't clear on how.  Shelley said including such references in the statement of claim without providing supporting scientific evidence could ultimately be what gets the suit dismissed before it goes to trial under Ontario's rules of civil procedure.  Toronto lawyer Rocco Galati, who is representing plaintiffs in the suit, initially agreed to speak to CBC News but then did not respond to follow-up requests for comment. (Trevor Hagan/The Canadian Press)  CBC News reached out multiple times to Galati, who is listed as the spokesperson for the lawsuit in a press release issued by Vaccine Choice Canada. He spoke with a reporter last Wednesday but did not agree to an on-the-record interview.  Galati told CBC News he would be available last Thursday for a recorded interview but did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday or the following Monday.  The CBC has also been named as a defendant in the lawsuit for allegedly propagating misinformation and ""false news"" about the coronavirus crisis.

Dr. Robert Strang said he is aware of the video that garnered more than 106,000 views in 24 hours, but the claims in it are not true.  ""There's nothing at all to suggest that this is actually an event that actually occurred,"" he said.  The video was created and shared on Facebook on Thursday by a woman who claims her daughter's friend is in critical care after getting a COVID-19 vaccine because her heart repeatedly stopped.  The woman goes on to make several unfounded claims about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and encourages viewers to spread her message.  Strang said Friday that neither Emergency Health Services nor the IWK Health Centre is aware of any events taking place similar to what's reported in the video, and that ""some other information would lead us to believe that this is a false story.""  The post has received more than 100 comments expressing support, including some sharing anti-vaccination views.  'Where's the evidence?'  Strang said he encourages people who view the video to think critically.  ""I would push back and say, 'Well, where's the evidence that this actually happened?'""  Strang said it's not time to create misinformation or false narratives about the vaccines.  ""It's just not helpful. And people who put this type of misinformation out, they're actually harming other people.""  He urged everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated.

8a2e3fdd,"By Guest Columnist MATTHEW CHARLES CARDINALE, CEO and news editor of Atlanta Progressive News As Atlanta’s City Council considers its next big moves on affordable housing and community development, decision-makers and stakeholders alike have the opportunity to benefit from a bold, cutting-edge policy tool: Affordable Housing Impact Statements. Much like an environmental impact statement or a fiscal impact statement, an Affordable Housing Impact Statement would specify the estimated impact of certain public policy decisions of the City Council on Atlanta’s affordable housing stock. The statement would be prepared by the Office of Housing and would look like this: ***** This legislation, if enacted, is estimated to have a projected impact upon the affordable housing stock of the City of Atlanta by: Adding ___ or decreasing ___ units affordable at 30 or below percent of the City of Atlanta Area Median Income (AMI); and Adding ___ or decreasing ___ units affordable between 30.01 and 50 percent of AMI; and Adding ___ or decreasing ___ units affordable at between 50.01 and 80 percent of AMI; and Adding ___ or decreasing ___ units affordable at over 80 percent of AMI. ****** The statements would be presented to Councilmembers before they vote on impacted legislation so that they are empowered with meaningful information about the consequences of their decisions as they’re making them. And the statements would be kept in a repository by the Municipal Clerk so that stakeholders can review the statements over time to see the trend of public policy and whether Atlanta is getting closer to, or further away, from, its goals. After my nearly 10 years of citizen advocacy before Atlanta’s Community Development/Human Resources Committee (CD/HR) on issues of affordable housing, I have become very familiar with the concerns of Councilmembers and the needs of Atlanta’s working families in connection with this issue. So, as a law student at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington, currently in my third year, I took the idea of Affordable Housing Impact Statements – an idea of Ben Howard, senior advocate, that was adopted by Georgia Stand Up’s policy platform in 2009 – and drafted a proposed ordinance for the City of Atlanta, implementing the idea. Due to the leadership of Chairman Andre Dickens and Councilman Michael Julian Bond, the draft ordinance was introduced at CD/HR in November 2014, and is pending there as a held paper: Atlanta has an affordable housing crisis that is getting worse every year. The cost of rental housing is getting higher and higher, and it is making it burdensome, if not impossible, for working class people–including those who work in Atlanta – to live in Atlanta. Tens of thousands of Atlanta households are cost-burdened, meaning they pay more than 30 percent of their income towards rent, according to a recent report by HR&A Advisors and Enterprise, Inc., on behalf of the City of Atlanta. This includes more than 25,000 cost-burdened renter households subsisting on $20,000 or less per year; and about 13,000 cost-burdened renter households making between $20,000 and $34,999 per year. People tend to think of the availability or lack of affordable housing as a product of market forces only, but public policy also plays a huge role. For example, routine decisions by the Atlanta City Council include land-use decisions that result in the loss of affordable units and replacing them with market-rate units, for example when a developer submits a proposal that clearly presumes the demolition of existing affordable units, like the San Lucia apartments by the Lindbergh Target. Other routine decisions that affect the housing stock include the acceptance of federal grant dollars like Community Development Block Grants for the production or rehabilitation of affordable housing. These grants can help meet the greatest unmet needs among Atlanta’s working families, if the units are appropriately targeted at 30 percent AMI. Impact statements would document the positive impact in terms of numbers of units and the income brackets of the households who will benefit. There are also bigger proposals already introduced or in the works, including: mandatory inclusionary zoning; land banks and land trusts; policies to deal with abandoned, foreclosed properties; and more. That is why this is an ideal time to enact Affordable Housing Impact Statements now, rather than later. That way we can have a meaningful, consistent way to document positive or negative impacts across a range of income brackets, as we consider each of these diverse proposals. Late last year, I had the opportunity to meet with Terri Lee, deputy commissioner of Planning and Community Development; and Derrick Jordan, interim director of the Office of Housing, to discuss their thoughts and concerns, which they also expressed to the CD/HR Committee. Since then, I have drafted an administrative memo, providing additional guidance on how such an impact statement could be composed; and proposed amendments to reduce the administrative burden on the Office of Housing. Also, the Council increased the Office of Housing’s staff in the most recent fiscal year budget, which is already in effect, so preparing these Impact Statements would be a funded mandate. We have a lot of work to do in terms of substantive policy making; and I think mandatory inclusionary upzoning, with a component for units at 30 percent AMI, and appropriate unit bonuses for developers, will be critical. I just think adopting an Affordable Housing Impact Statement reporting policy is a common sense next step, a step that is focused on process, to make sure that we are collecting information in a pro-active and consistent way. It can help us monitor and gauge the potential impacts of policy decisions as we make them. I think adoption of this policy would show the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that Atlanta is serious about addressing structural barriers to fair housing in an affirmative way. It also will show the world we are serious about leading the way on this important issue. If you agree that Affordable Housing Impact Statements are a good idea, please contact members the Atlanta City Council’s CD/HR Committee, including Chairman Dickens as well as Councilmembers Bond, Kwanza Hall, Ivory Young, Cleta Winslow, Keisha Lance Bottoms, and Joyce Sheperd.",Energy Secretary Rick Perry says CO2 is not the main driver of climate change,true,

,"The Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) has said that the porous and extensive border area requiring security coverage was the reason for the spate of smuggling and arms proliferation in the country.  The NCS, however, said that the procurement of three mobile scanners for it by the Ministry of Finance would further enhance its surveillance and security at the country’s borders.  Col. Hameed Ali, retired, the Comptroller General, NCS, said this at the presentation of the service’s 2021 budget before the House Committee on Customs Service on Thursday in Abuja.  The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the NCS proposed a budget of N242.45 billion for the 2021 fiscal year.  Ali said that there was no way the NCS, which has a little over 15,000 officers, would be able to police the nation’s boarders effectively.  The CGC said that it was worrisome that smuggling often happened in border communities where most of the residents had no feel of governance and therefore bare no allegiance to the Nigerian government.  He said that those residents would rather bare their allegiance to smugglers because of lack of government presence in the border communities, stressing that the NCS would continue to do its best to police the nation’s borders.  “I feel their pain, in some cases they have to cross the border to go to school and also fetch water because there is no government presence,” the CGC said.  He said that the war against smugglers should not be left to the NCS alone, adding that other security agencies should be involved in the fight against smuggling.  Ali also disclosed that the three scanners purchased would be deployed to Apapa, Tin can Island and Port Harcourt, adding that the scanner would be use to improve its work.  On recruitment into the NCS, the CGC said that the service had not recruited in the past 17 years, adding that recruitment into the service was the prerogative of the President.  He said that the NCS needed to recruit officers, adding that there was a gap in terms of officers currently in the service.  “There will come a time that there will be no junior officers again in NCS; we need more officers and this is why we embarked on the recruitment of 3200 officers for which we have so far spent N40 million,” he said.  Rep Leke Abejide, the Chairman of the committee, said that the committee was interested in the 2020 NCS budget performance as it was one of the major agencies of revenue generation in the country.","NCS says Nigeria border area extensive, porous | The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News",true,43357230460473537121883896667477651973
c850e415,"Words scaled by the frequency that President Trump has used them in tweets during his term in office, according to the Trump Twitter Archive. WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump spent much of the 2020 presidential campaign insisting that he could only lose if the election was rigged against him, and he has spent nearly every day since his defeat claiming his dire predictions of fraud had come to pass. But just as he cried foul before a single vote was cast – something he also did in 2016 – Trump has maintained he was robbed of victory without any credible evidence to support that belief. Despite assurances from his own departments of Justice and Homeland Security that no serious fraud occurred, Trump has raged against the election result and mounted a relentless campaign to reverse President-elect Joe Biden's 306-232 Electoral College win. More: Congress' count of Electoral College votes could be most contentious in 144 years. Here are past dramatic moments The president, his lawyers and his allies have filed scores of lawsuits; made repeated allegations of election fraud in news and social media; organized protests; tried to convince state legislatures to take action; and held hearings in various state houses, hotel ballrooms and, at one point, a landscaping company. And on Wednesday, 13 senators and more than 100 Republican lawmakers plan to object to the certification of Biden's win when Congress meets in a joint session. All those efforts to overturn the election can be a bit dizzying, so USA TODAY has broken it down by the numbers to help make sense of it all. Election lawsuits: 62 The president and his allies filed 62 lawsuits in state and federal courts seeking to overturn election results in states the president lost, according to Marc Elias, a Democratic election lawyer who is tracking the outcomes. Election lawsuit defeats: 61 Out of the 62 lawsuits filed challenging the presidential election, 61 have failed, according to Elias. Some cases were dismissed for lack of standing and others based on the merits of the voter fraud allegations. The decisions have came from both Democratic-appointed and Republican-appointed judges – including federal judges appointed by Trump. More: 'It really is over now': The 24 hours that likely thwarted Trump's effort to overturn the election State Supreme Courts in Arizona, Nevada and Arizona each rejected or declined to hear Trump’s appeals to overturn results in those states, while the Pennsylvania and Michigan supreme courts denied multiple lawsuits. The 60th and 61st losses came in recent days. Last Friday, a Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas dismissed a lawsuit from Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, that argued Vice President Mike Pence has the conditional power to decide which states' Electoral College votes to count. More: A look at what several state supreme courts said about rejecting attempts to overturn Biden's election win On Monday, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by voters in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Arizona that argued state legislatures should have met after the election to certify votes. The lone victory for the Trump team was a small one. A Pennsylvania judge sided with the Trump campaign, ruling that voters could not go back and “cure” their ballots if they failed to provide proper identification three days after the election. The ruling affected few votes and did not change the outcome in Pennsylvania, which Biden won by 81,660 votes. Number of contested states: 6 The vast majority of the lawsuits were in six pivotal battleground states that Biden won: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump won five of the states four years ago in his victory over Hillary Clinton, but Biden flipped each to the Democratic column. House Republicans who plan to object to Electoral College results Wednesday said they plan to target these same six states. Number of times the US Supreme Court sided against Trump: 2 The U.S. Supreme Court twice refused to take up Trump-endorsed lawsuits that sought to overturn the results of the Nov. 3 election. In a one-sentence denial, the Supreme Court on Dec. 8 rejected a request from Pennsylvania Republicans that sought to overturn Biden's win in the state. The challenge, led Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., claimed that the Republican-led state legislature's expansion of absentee voting violated the state's constitution. Three days later, the Supreme Court refused to let Texas challenge the election results in four battleground states critical to Trump's defeat. The court said Texas did not demonstrate ""a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another state conducts its elections."" Number of recounts: 3 Georgia held two recounts of its presidential election results, both reaffirming Biden's win in the state. Wisconsin had one recount that confirmed Biden's victory there. The first recount in Georgia – a hand recount ordered by the state – found Biden won by 12,284 votes, a narrower margin than the 14,196-vote lead he held immediately following the election. Local election administrators identified uncounted ballots in four counties. Each was the result of human error. The second recount in Georgia – one requested by the Trump campaign – narrowed Biden's victory to 11,779 votes Votes Trump gained from recounts: 2,343 In Wisconsin, Biden gained 74 votes following a partial recount of the state's results that focused only on two Democratic strongholds, Milwaukee and Dane counties. It increased Biden's statewide margin to 20,682 votes out of about 3 million cast. Adding the differences in both states together, Trump gained 2,343 votes as a result of the Georgia and Wisconsin recounts. Number of elections Trump has claimed were rigged: At least 6 This is not the first time Trump has declared an election had been ""rigged"" or ""stolen."" On Election Day in 2012, when President Barack Obama defeated his Republican challenger Mitt Romney, Trump tweeted that there were ""reports of voting machines switching Romney votes to Obama."" ""Pay close attention to the machines, don't let your vote be stolen,"" he said. Four years later, when Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, defeated Trump in the Iowa caucuses, Trump tweeted, ""Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!"" Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016 Trump also said the 2016 Democratic primary was ""rigged"" against Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and, as in 2020, he declared the 2016 general election race was ""rigged"" against him before it even took place. Even after winning the election and being sworn in as president, Trump baselessly insisted more than 3 million illegal votes were cast against him. A White House commission Trump created to investigate election fraud disbanded without finding any evidence to support the president's claims. Trump went on to allege ""fraud"" in the 2018 midterm elections and to imply there was something nefarious about the late changing vote totals in tight races, though such changes are routine in close elections where projections cannot be made immediately. Just out — in Arizona, SIGNATURES DON’T MATCH. Electoral corruption - Call for a new Election? We must protect our Democracy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2018 The president also declared in 2020, without evidence, that the Democratic primary had once again been ""rigged"" against Sanders. Number of electoral votes changed as the result of Trump's effort: 0 Despite all the lawsuits, recounts and false voter fraud allegations, the Electoral College on Dec. 14 elected Biden the next president by a margin of 306 to 232 – marking no change in the electoral outcome. Biden finished with a record 81,281,502 votes nationally, defeating Trump in the popular vote by a sizable 7 million votes. With 51.3% of the national popular vote, Biden won with the highest share of the vote for a challenger of an incumbent president since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932. Trump won 46.8% of the vote nationally. Days until Biden's inauguration Wednesday's joint session of Congress will have procedural fireworks as 13 U.S. senators and more than 100 Republican House members plan to object to electoral votes from potentially six battleground states that Biden won. But the efforts are doomed to fail, lacking the votes in the Democratic-controlled House and even in the Republican-led Senate. Because each objection could lead to hours of debate in the House and Senate, the session could be a marathon. But in the end, Biden and Harris will be inaugurated as the next president and vice president at noon on Jan. 20.",Democrats To America: We Own The Government!,true,
0ee11c2b,"n a Capitol Hill hearing room two summers ago, privacy activist Christopher Soghoian organized a stunning demonstration of some new police surveillance technology. A small group of congressional staffers were handed ""clean"" cellphones and invited to start calling each other while, off to the side, a Berkeley communications researcher named Kurtis Heimerl turned on his gear. After a few minutes, Soghoian told the staffers to hang up—and then Heimerl played back their conversations. Not only that, the two men told the staffers, the digital eavesdropping equipment was capable of sucking all the data from their phones—emails, contact files, music, videos—whatever was on them. Since then, reports that federal, state and local law enforcement agencies are using such devices to track suspects and criminals without warrants have percolated in the national media, thanks largely to Soghoian, now the American Civil Liberties Union's top technologist on privacy issues. (A federal appeals court ruled June 11 that the Fourth Amendment protects people from such intrusions.) Far less well known is the use of such technology by foreign intelligence services against U.S. targets in Washington, D.C., sometimes using criminal go-betweens. It's a spy war that Q, James Bond's fictional techno-wizard, would envy. Instead of Walther PPK's and Aston Martins, the weapons are silent devices that capture cellphone signals. On one side are the world's major spy services, including those of China, Russia, Israel, France and now Iran. Arrayed against them are technical teams from the FBI and U.S. Secret Service, backed up by the NSA and the CIA. The bad guys may be winning this war, says Soghoian, a ponytailed, British-American former hacker with a Ph.D. from Indiana University. Intelligence officials worry that he's right, but won't say so publicly. And the feds don't want U.S. citizens to know about the technology, critics say, because they are shielding their use of similar devices, the most prominent of which is the StingRay. Spies With Big Ears Call it the ""IMSI catcher"" war, with the acronym standing for International Mobile Subscriber Identity. Every device that communicates with a cell tower—mobile phone, smartphone or tablet—has one. What StingRay (manufactured by Florida-based Harris Corp.) and its competitors do is act like a cellphone tower, drawing the unique IMSI signals into their grasp. Once the device is locked onto a signal, the quarry's data is ripe for the plucking. Major targets include people working for U.S. national security agencies, defense contractors and officials, including members of such congressional panels as the armed services and intelligence committees. ""This type of technology has been used in the past by foreign intelligence agencies here and abroad to target Americans, both [in the] U.S. government and corporations,"" former FBI deputy director Tim Murphy tells Newsweek. ""There's no doubt in my mind that they're using it."" Mike Janke, a former Navy SEAL and co-founder of Silent Circle, a company that sells state-of-the-art encryption software, says, ""Defense firms in the Washington, D.C. area have found IMSI catchers attached to the light poles in their parking lots. In February, one or two were found in the parking lot of a defense contractor near Washington."" He adds, ""They've also been found in Palo Alto,"" the capital of Silicon Valley. ""The FBI has been called in, but you can't track who has made it."" Keith Flannigan, who has worked for decades in law enforcement as a technical surveillance specialist, says high-tech criminal hackers, mostly in Europe, sell the information to interested parties, including spy services. Such transactions make it easier for the buyers to hide. ""That is why,"" he says of the many cases in which hacking has been detected, ""we don't know who the real ones are"" behind an electro-heist. ""They are smart enough to hire professionals to ensure that they don't get caught.""According to security experts, the main actors in electro-spying on U.S. targets are ""the big three""—China, Russia and Israel, the countries fingered by the CIA in a 2013 CIA National Intelligence Estimate on cyberthreats. Janke says Iran has also become a sophisticated player. According to a 2011 report in The Washington Post, Iran-backed Hezbollah used ""cellphone records and calling patterns"" to bust a CIA spy ring in Beirut.""It's a cat-and-mouse game,"" says Janke, a covert communications expert who ""has led and coordinated highly classified missions worldwide,"" according to Silent Circle's website. But it has ""tremendous implications,"" says James Bernazzani, who once headed the FBI's Hezbollah-tracking counterterrorism unit, partly because StingRay ""technology can defeat standard encryption."" To further complicate the electro-battlefield, there are also devices on the market that each side can use to detect when StingRays are aimed at them. ""Technological advances are most dangerous when the adversary puts 'the good guys' in a reactive and defensive position,"" Bernazzani told Newsweek. ""Technological advances need to stay ahead of those who wish us harm. That is critical."" As in all spy wars, street-level electro-espionage and counterespionage operations are largely invisible. In a rare exposure in 1998, a Russian diplomat was caught eavesdropping on the State Department's C Street headquarters. When the bust was announced, no mention was made of the technology involved, but a former CIA expert tells Newsweek the Russian was wearing ""a wired-up body vest"" that turned him into a walking, driving antenna nest. If stories like that conjure up black-and-white images of Nazi radio trucks cruising the dark streets of Paris in search of French Resistance agents, you're not far off, espionage veterans say. ""The tech officers [of foreign spy services] are always on the prowl for access points where [communications] can be secretly intercepted or sent, and that's why the opposition's tech officer's movements are of particular interest to [U.S. government] surveillance,"" the former CIA man says. ""It's rare that technical operations get exposed, since they're so carefully planned and executed."" The electro-war is ""3-D—in the air, underwater, in buildings, underground,"" the ex-spy explains. ""A tech team in a van may be targeting a U.S. official's cellphone inside a restaurant and turning on the microphone remotely. Or they may be tracking a target whose car has a beacon. ""Traditionally, the main base of…technical ops is from an embassy, consulate or military base,"" he adds. ""It's sovereign territory and safe.… The Russian Embassy, up on the hill overlooking Georgetown, has an ideal location to grab signals. Israel's embassy is next door to Intelsat,"" which operates over 50 communications satellites for U.S. and foreign clients. The Chinese Consulate in Tijuana, Mexico, has great electro-coverage of Southern California, according to the U.S. government's Intelligence Threat Handbook. It's Everywhere Now Thanks to Edward Snowden's snooping disclosures about the National Security Agency, we all know that the U.S. is listening too, mostly from the air-conditioned comfort of the NSA's headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, or in American embassies. According to a recent piece by intelligence expert Matthew Aid in Foreign Policy magazine, the FBI attaches StingRay-like devices to helicopters and flies them over foreign embassies in Washington. That's a breeze compared with electro-spy vs. spy ops on the ground. ""Technical operations can get very complex and high-risk when it comes to involving the human factor and street work,"" the CIA veteran says. ""When case officers""—jargon for spy handlers—""join with tech officers and local agents, the intel wars take on a high-risk flavor."" Harris Corp. is no longer the sole source for IMSI catchers. Judging by the catalog of SafeTech, a Brazilian dealer in high-end police equipment, obtained by Newsweek, StingRays and associated equipment are easily available worldwide. (The company does not comment on its sales.) Meanwhile, foreign manufacturers have developed their own versions.
""There are several others [on the market],"" says Flannigan, director of International Dynamics Research Corp., a Virginia company that offers technical surveillance countermeasures training to private and government clients in the U.S. and abroad. ""There is a much better unit that is totally undetectable, that is good for about 1 ½ miles, that will record and resend all cell activity in that area."" One leading manufacturer is an Israeli company, Ability, which, according to its website, was ""founded in 1993 by a team of experts in military intelligence and communications, who were joined by specialists in electronics and mathematics…to devise state of the art encryption and decryption solutions…to security and intelligence agencies, military forces, police and homeland security services around the world."" ""The sword cuts both ways,"" says Murphy, who worked in technical, undercover and surveillance operations during his FBI career. ""As we advance in technology, the bad guys advance in technology, too. You're seeing that in the cyberwars.… The tools are easy to get ahold of. They're cheaper and faster, and the availability is widespread. So it wouldn't surprise me that adversarial, state-sponsored activity is going on and targeting our individuals, and at an exponential rate."" It's everywhere now, experts say. Stalkers have it. Private eyes have it. Tabloid reporters could have it (if they want to risk getting busted like Rupert Murdoch's British cellphone snoopers). Surely political ""opposition researchers"" have it. Nobody's iPhone or iPad is safe from the IMSI catchers.
In the wake of a 1996 incident in which a Florida couple ""accidentally"" eavesdropped on a conference call between key Republicans, including Newt Gingrich and future House Speaker John Boehner, federal legislation was passed to protect analog communications from interception. It didn't work. And obviously, the tech world has moved far beyond those primitive devices, privacy activists argue. In a paper to be published later this year in the Harvard Journal of Law & Technology, Soghoian and Stephanie K. Pell, a former federal prosecutor who served as counsel to the assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's National Security Division, argue that ""policy makers did not learn the right lessons from the analog cellular interception vulnerabilities of the '90s.… ""[The] communications of Americans will only be secured through the use of privacy enhancing technologies like encryption,"" they write, ""not with regulations prohibiting the use or sale of interception technology."" Try getting government officials to even talk about the need for higher encryption standards. ""In spite of the security threat posed by foreign government and criminal use of cellular interception technology,"" Soghoian and Pell write, ""U.S. government agencies continue to treat practically everything about it as a closely guarded 'source and method'""—jargon for intelligence tradecraft protected from public disclosure—""shrouding the technical capabilities, limitations and even the name of the equipment they use from public disclosure."" Indeed, the FBI, Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security all declined to comment on the security threat for Newsweek. A spokesman for the State Department said only, ""We provide briefings to our diplomats on the vulnerabilities of using cellphones and telephones while serving overseas,"" which includes reminders of ""the risks associated with revealing personal information via telephones or cellular phones."" The main feature of StingRays and the like is that one need not say anything on a cellphone to serve up valuable information. Once such devices suck data from your machine, they can find you (and your stored contacts) anywhere—even when your phone is turned off. U.S. law enforcement and spy agencies, which make extensive use of StingRays and countermeasures, refuse to talk about the security threat, especially in a public forum. Soghoian says that after his demonstration in the congressional hearing room two summers ago, ""the staff were pretty shocked…but nothing happened after. ""No hearings, no letters, nada.""",TEXAS RURAL HOSPITAL CLOSURES (1995-2015),true,
,"Foreword – the Prime Minister  Nearly 2 years ago, after decades in hibernation, the UK finally re-emerged on the world stage as an independent trading nation and global champion for free trade.  And since reclaiming our own chair at the WTO , our feet have barely touched the floor. Seldom has a week seemed to pass without another FTA being signed, sealed and delivered somewhere in the world. The numbers continue ticking relentlessly upwards but at the time of writing we’ve already secured agreements covering something like two-thirds of all British trade and with countries that run, if not quite from A to Z, then certainly from Albania to Vietnam.  But an FTA is ultimately just a tool. And while this blizzard of British diplomacy has been bad news for protectionists, mercantilists and isolationists the world over it will only be good news for British businesses and British workers if we learn to use that tool properly.  That’s what this strategy is all about. Helping you make the most of our new-found freedoms by bringing the whole government together to deploy a cornucopia of trade outposts in distant lands, experts to provide the support you need, trade shows to put you in the international shop window, finance for those who need it and more besides so that businesses large and small, from every sector, in every part of the United Kingdom can start selling to every market in the world.  It will help us build back better from the pandemic, giving businesses the support they need make the most of their potential and exploit the UK’s new competitive edge.  It will help take our green industrial revolution worldwide, making it easier than ever for UK companies to share cutting-edge carbon-free technology with the places where it’s needed most.  And it will help with this government’s core mission of levelling up the whole United Kingdom, spreading opportunity and prosperity right around the country.  It’s a welcome shot in the arm for UK PLC, the start of a new and exciting chapter for us all, and I look forward to working with employers of all shapes and sizes as we once again make the UK a nation that does business with the world.  Foreword – the Secretary of State for International Trade and President of the Board of Trade  Free trade agreements are the lifeblood of my department. But they won’t mean anything if UK businesses don’t take advantage of them.  That’s why, in setting out our new world-leading Export Strategy, I want to set some joint goals – goals for both business and government.  First, I want to fire the starting gun on the Race to a Trillion. UK exports are due to hit the £1 trillion mark by the mid-2030s, but I want us to hit that mark before then. I want us to be audacious and to aim for the end of the decade – not as a target, but as a goal.  Second, I want each and every corner of the UK to see exporting as a natural business goal. Exporting isn’t just for the South East of England. It can and must be a force for levelling up the UK.  And third, I want every business to see their products as a potential export. The Made in Britain logo has always been a stamp of quality – from Sheffield steel to Scotch whisky to Welsh lamb. But now that stamp could equally be on Peppa Pig or the Premier League. We export world-class services and culture as well as manufactured goods or agricultural produce.  To achieve these goals, we will need joint working between government and business. And we will need a change of mindset in both. That’s what this strategy sets out to achieve. Government will lend its weight to providing the advice, the expertise and the marketing. Business will do what it does best – selling its world-class products and services.  Our strategy responds to and anticipates changes in the global economy, by tilting towards the Indo-Pacific. At the same time, we will tighten ties with traditional trade allies, the source of prosperity over centuries. We know global markets want the UK’s high-quality goods and services. And we start from a position of strength – the UK is the world’s sixth largest exporter and the second largest services exporter.  Our future prosperity lies, in part, in exports. Exporting businesses are more competitive, pay higher wages and are more profitable. Global sales support local jobs. And international revenues boost the UK’s finances, so that we can reinvest in public services. Our strategy will therefore support our wider aspirations as a nation. Working with exporters of digital, artificial intelligence, shipbuilding and green goods and services will help realise our ambitions as a science and technology superpower and in the Net Zero transformation. Together, we can level up the country by sparking an exporting revolution that will ensure we build back better and stronger than ever.  Executive summary  There’s a world of opportunity, matched by the UK’s export potential — our strongest export markets are typically found in markets like the United States or Europe. However, the global economy is changing. Rapid economic growth in the Indo-Pacific region is shifting the world’s centre of economic gravity eastwards. The world economy is also expected to become more services-oriented, and the UK’s specialist sectors are predicted to grow faster than the global average.  Exports are a critical part of our economy — exports support millions of jobs in the UK and evidence suggests important links between trade and productivity. This export plan seeks to ensure these benefits are felt across the country. It will build the exporting capability of critical sectors, such as tech and clean economy. This will support the government’s Innovation Strategy, Net Zero Strategy and Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution.  We are refreshing our approach to meet our trading context — our 2018 Export Strategy laid strong foundations for export policy, promotion and support, but since then the trading environment has changed significantly. Our refreshed strategy will demonstrate how we will ensure certainty and continuity of the support we provide to exporters. It also sets out our new, clear strategic approach to capitalise on our new trade agreements and market access work.  Our ambition is to reach £1 trillion in exports annually — we want businesses to be ambitious in their exporting. Projections suggest that we will reach £1 trillion in exports annually by the mid-2030s, but we think can get there faster if we work together. We are therefore challenging business and government to Race to a Trillion. This strategy will be the joint framework for us to accelerate that race and grow our economy through exports.  Delivering in partnership with business is critical — the strategy will explore Better Support, Better Access to Finance and a Better Business Environment for exporters. Each of these is underpinned by Better Data to ensure we target our activity for the greatest impact. We will work with business on implementation and continue to challenge ourselves on improving our offer. We will use existing governance to monitor implementation and use our new monitoring and evaluation framework to assess our progress.  Made in the UK, Sold to the World — the strategy comprises a 12-point plan which sets out the path that government will take to transform our support offer and Build Back Better. This will allow the UK to level up and project Global Britain. Among other initiatives the plan includes a range of new support measures, including the new Export Support Service ( ESS ) and the UK Export Academy.  We will support strategic sectors and maximise our comparative advantage — we will seek to maximise on the potential of the UK’s world-leading sectors, such as digital services, clean economy, life sciences and creative industries. We will also focus on sectors of national significance such as agriculture, food and drink and shipbuilding. We are partnering with industry to provide impactful, sector-specific support.  We are ready to trade with our closest trading partners, emerging economies and developing markets — we know our work to open markets in the Indo-Pacific is critical if we want to maximise our comparative advantage and export performance. We will develop new relationships in these regions, for example through our accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership ( CPTPP ). We will continue to strengthen ties with longstanding trading partners.  Our strategy is underpinned by core values — we take pride in our values, which align to exporting best practices, which we will uphold and reflect in our trade agreements. We will not compromise our commitments to protect the environment and tackle climate change through trade. We will continue to champion equality and opportunity for all. We are also committed to upholding rules-based trade.  A world of opportunity  Our strongest export markets are typically found in markets like the United States or Europe. However, the global economy is changing. Rapid economic growth in the Indo-Pacific region is shifting the world’s centre of economic gravity eastwards. China, India, Brazil, Russia, Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey collectively are expected to equal the G7 ’s share of global import demand by 2050.[footnote 1] Other economies, such as Vietnam and the Philippines, are expected to grow even more rapidly in the coming decades.[footnote 2] Between 2000 and 2019, the Indo-Pacific region accounted for 50% of global economic growth in real terms. By 2050 this is expected to be 56%.[footnote 3]  The most successful exporting nations will need to create and sustain market share in these economies. Our assessments show that the UK’s comparative advantage in exporting high quality goods and services is particularly adapted to exploiting these markets. The markets for these goods and services is growing as the middle class expands.  Chart 1: Regional drivers of global economic growth in real terms [footnote 4]  Chart 2: World population by income threshold[footnote 5]  In 2019, there were around 1.7 billion ‘middle class’ consumers in the world – equivalent to 1 in every 5 people (Chart 2). By 2050, the global middle class could reach 3.5 billion people – equivalent to 1 in every 3 people. Over half of these middle-class consumers are likely to live in China and the Indo-Pacific.  Trade is expected to become gradually more services oriented, as rising incomes shift spending patterns in emerging markets and as moves to enhance supply chain resilience lead to increased reshoring of manufacturing. By 2030, services sectors are expected to account for 77% of global gross domestic product ( GDP ), up from 75% in 2019. At the same time the UK’s specialist sectors are expected to grow faster than the global average in the coming decade.[footnote 6] Global import demand for UK specialist sectors is expected to grow from £6 trillion in 2019 to £9.2 trillion by 2030.[footnote 7]  Chart 3 – Global GDP by sector, 2019 to 2030[footnote 8]  Free trade is evolving, and the UK has an important opportunity to trade more and trade differently. We are embarking on a new era in our trading relationships, negotiating innovative, world-leading free trade agreements with the markets of the future. By aligning our agreements and relationships to UK priorities, we are creating export opportunities that work for all parts of the UK. For example, our new free trade agreement with Japan, while delivering benefits across the economy, contains cutting edge digital and data provisions which support UK tech and digital-savvy firms to export to Japan.  We also want our exporters to be active in developing markets. For example, our recent government- to- government agreement with Peru has opened a new market for many UK businesses, with opportunities in the portfolio worth £1.7 billion. As we Build Back Better, developing countries will benefit from high quality UK project expertise, as we committed to in the G7 Carbis Bay agreement. UK exporters can access opportunities in emerging markets that are opened and supported by the UK’s development work including Official Development Assistance ( ODA ) spending, such as from the British Support for Infrastructure Projects ( BSIP ) programme and Growth Gateway.  The aim of this refreshed strategy is to help UK business to grow through exporting. Whether through manufacturing or services, if we embrace that collective mission, nominal exports have the potential to reach £800 billion by 2030, and £1 trillion by the mid-2030s, or even sooner if we can get more businesses across the UK exporting.[footnote 9] This strategy will help make that projection a reality.  Our strategic context  Now is a pivotal moment for UK exporters. We must seize the export opportunity of an independent trade policy by negotiating UK trade agreements and making exporting easier for UK business so we can Build Back Better. Exports support millions of jobs, enable small businesses to increase their productivity, and extend the UK’s economic ties across the globe. Our export plan lays the groundwork for UK exporters to thrive. We are fundamentally an open and liberalised economy that is ready to do business and trade with the world.  We are taking important steps across our domestic policy to build our exporting capability in critical sectors, such as the clean economy and technology. Our Innovation Strategy, Net Zero Strategy and Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution will shape the UK as a science superpower. Measures like Help to Grow will raise the productive capacity of business, and help firms internationalise in the process. We will capitalise on the government’s economic policy development. We will cement our exporting values of competitive imports, innovative ideas and foreign demand, all underpinned by a resilient and productive business base.  Our strategic approach  Business has asked for consistency in policy, so this strategy builds on our 2018 Export Strategy.  We will continue to:  encourage and inspire businesses that can export but have not started or are just beginning  and inspire businesses that can export but have not started or are just beginning inform businesses by providing information, advice and practical assistance on exporting from the public or private sector, or their peers  businesses by providing information, advice and practical assistance on exporting from the public or private sector, or their peers connect UK businesses to overseas buyers, international markets, and each other  UK businesses to overseas buyers, international markets, and each other put finance at the heart of our offer  This strong platform is the basis for our action-oriented refreshed strategy. It will enable us to adapt to the changes demanded by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and make the most of our legislative freedom.  To take advantage of new trading opportunities made possible by new free trade agreements, this approach will allow us to:  encourage and inspire businesses, and promote UK exporters in markets including those where we have signed, or are negotiating a free trade agreement.  give businesses the right information to benefit from these trade agreements, and make it easier to trade  connect UK businesses to overseas buyers or intermediaries, and ensure we are engaged with business and governments as we implement agreements or resolve barriers to trade  Taken together, we will support companies globally to take advantage of the preferential terms we have secured, no matter what stage they are at in their export journey.  Our ambition  The world has moved on since 2018. The UK has left the EU. We are recovering from a profound crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, deeper shifts are accelerating growth in Indo-Pacific markets and in future-oriented services sectors powered by innovations in digital technology. As we emerge from the crisis and turn our eyes to the future, we believe that we should set ourselves a bold national ambition. This is a whole-economy endeavour to mobilise our efforts in support of our project to boost exporting in Britain.  Race to a Trillion  In 2019, the Conservative Manifesto promised to redouble efforts towards exporting and we want to set an ambitious target to realise this commitment. We are challenging government and business to Race to a Trillion, with a shared ambition of lifting UK exports to £1 trillion each year.  Our projections suggest that we will reach this level of exports in the mid-2030s, but we think we can do better if we work together. Our refreshed Export Strategy embodies a 12-point plan for exports that will be the joint framework for business and government to work together to accelerate our Race to a Trillion.  Making it happen  We need to act now. Exporting is critical to UK jobs, and we know international markets are becoming increasingly competitive. UK trade agreements pave the way for easier exporting, and we must capitalise on our new trading relationships to take exporters to the fast-growing markets of the future.  Our action-focused plan will deliver:  better support – transforming our service offering to new and existing exporters, being more joined up and more digital to reach small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) at scale  – transforming our service offering to new and existing exporters, being more joined up and more digital to reach small and medium-sized enterprises ( ) at scale better access to finance – ensuring no viable export fails due to lack of finance or insurance  – ensuring no viable export fails due to lack of finance or insurance a better business environment – making it easier to export, raising the competitiveness of all UK exporters and helping developing country partners to improve the climate for trade  – making it easier to export, raising the competitiveness of all UK exporters and helping developing country partners to improve the climate for trade better data – harnessing new technologies and legal powers to target support, inform policy and identify export opportunities  Our effort will be focused on where we can add value. We will not try to offer services that the market is better placed to provide. Rather we will focus on where markets fail and where we can add value. We will do what only governments can do.  Working in partnership with business is critical to our success. Whether resolving market access barriers, enhancing our trade diplomacy or providing critical support and finance, we will choose partnership to unlock the UK’s economic and exporting potential. We will work with business to foster positive change in the culture of exporting for all parts of the UK, all local communities, and all sectors of the economy. In joint enterprise, business and government can work together to build a Global Britain of commerce and trade.  In this spirit, we will work closely with business representative organisations, trade associations and the UK’s sector leaders to champion UK businesses of all sizes on the world stage. We will work with all UK nations, the mayoral combined authorities, local authorities, the British chambers and regional partners such as the Midlands Engine Partnership, NP11 and the planned Northern Powerhouse growth body. We will work with these partner organisations to capitalise on their networks and regional insight. This strategy will also align with the wider business support offer, including growth hubs, as part of the wider Enterprise Strategy, to be launched in 2022.  As a signal of this intent, and in recognition of the critical role, insight, and leverage of business in this joint endeavour, we will support the launch of the Trade in Services Council ( TISC ) alongside this Export Strategy. Led by industry and with support from the Department for International Trade ( DIT ), it will include trade associations and a wide range of services companies of all sizes to bring together a collective voice on cross-services priorities related to the promotion of international trade.  We applaud the services sector coming together to create this Council, coordinated by the Confederation of British Industry ( CBI ). It will be an important forum to boost trade in services across the UK, working in partnership with government to articulate the value of services trade to the UK economy. We will also be working in close partnership with business through our engagement fora to oversee the implementation of the strategy.  These new projects will bring business and government together to take an action-oriented, economy-wide view of how we best implement and realise the ambitions in this strategy. Our export plan will put business at the heart of decision-making on the steps that we collectively take to embrace the opportunities that flow from our independent trade policy.  Introducing our 12-point plan: Made in the UK, Sold to the World  This is a national effort, led by business, supported by government.  Here is how government will play its part:  Last month we launched the new ESS , our first ever end-to-end service to support businesses exporting to Europe. Over £45 million in funding has been awarded over the Spending Review 2021 period for the digital transformation of DIT ’s export support services, delivered through an expansion of ESS to cover all markets. In September we opened new offices in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and a second DIT HQ in Darlington, with dedicated teams that for the first time will focus on extending the opportunities from the government’s international trade work across the UK, levelling up export growth and supporting jobs. This is historic. Through the European Regional Development Fund ( ERDF ), the Internationalisation Fund is providing 7,500 SMEs in England with financial assistance to export and internationalise. We will launch the UK SME Export Support Fund, to provide SMEs with financial assistance to internationalise. Our world-leading export credit agency, UK Export Finance ( UKEF ), will expand its products and delivery network to boost support to UK exporters and their overseas buyers. We will focus on strengthening a joint approach, connecting governments and business through our global networks. We will extend the reach and range of our pilot Export Academy to offer bespoke training programmes and digital tools to help businesses navigate the technicalities of exporting and find opportunities overseas. We will extend our community of Export Champions, ensuring businesses can build and learn from exporting successes through business-to-business networking and peer-to-peer learning. We will champion the government’s priority sectors through our innovative campaign Made in the UK, Sold to the World. We are piloting our UK Tradeshow Programme ( UKTP ) to propel our efforts and promote Team UK at the world’s largest tradeshows. We will put exporting at the heart of reforms to regulations, cross-government measures and regulatory diplomacy to help foster the conditions for exporting businesses to thrive. We will utilise the UK government’s international teams based in over 180 global markets to provide sector and market specific support to innovative, high growth companies to help them grow internationally. We will continue to open new markets for UK exporters through our new trade deals, with the ambition of covering 80% of UK trade by the end of 2022, and broader work to remove market access barriers.  1. Export Support Service  We have created a new end-to-end ESS for UK exporters.  Through the ESS we have developed a single point of contact and entry for exporters to Europe.  Over £45 million funding has been awarded over the Spending Review 2021 period for the digital transformation of DIT ’s export support services, delivered through an expansion of DIT ’s new Europe-focused ESS to cover all markets.  The ESS has 3 main aims:  simplify guidance and access to support for business  target specific difficulties businesses are having in exporting to Europe  promote the opportunities and support government offers  If you’re a UK business selling goods or services to Europe, you can contact the UK government export support team by phone or online.  Our staff are here to provide guidance on:  exporting to new markets  paperwork you need to sell your goods abroad  rules for a specific country where you want to sell services  To ask the export support team a question, visit https://www.gov.uk/ask-export-support-team.  This is the first end-to-end support service for exporters. Built with the expertise from our highly regarded International Trade Advisers, ESS has a single point of entry and interactive service provision, working closely with British Embassies and High Commissioners to support businesses in-market.  In the longer term, we are working to ensure that export services are digital by default and to create a seamless journey across GOV.UK. We will also use the insight gained from working with businesses to shape future UK government policy, ensuring exporter interests are factored into decisions. Finally, subject to the success of the programme, we will be expanding ESS to support businesses exporting to anywhere in the world.  Going forward, we will be aligning ESS with other DIT initiatives to create an export system that supports businesses at all stages of their export journey. This will include providing global in-market insight, business connections and export support for high potential SMEs to help them break into and grow in new markets. The reform of this overseas support is already active in the China, North America, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean Her Majesty’s Trade Commissioner ( HMTC ) regions. We will be rolling out the service in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan HMTC region over the next few months. From April 2022, we will expand to Europe, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Asia Pacific and South Asia HMTC regions.  2. Supporting exporters across all parts of the UK  We will extend the reach of our export services across the whole of the United Kingdom. As part of this mission, we will invest significant new resource in ensuring that potential exporters across the country can access the support that they need to grow their business through exporting.  Previously, DIT ’s presence has been largely localised to our headquarters in London.  To increase our capacity to support businesses across the UK, we have:  opened new Trade and Investment offices in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland  established a second DIT HQ in Darlington  DIT will have over 550 roles stationed in these offices by 2025.  Through these offices we will support businesses to export, attract investment and take advantage of the opportunities of our new FTAs . We will engage businesses on trade policy and market access issues that reflect local priorities and the competitive advantage of sectors and specialisms around the UK.  The UK government, through DIT , is responsible for international trade agreements. We share with the devolved administrations the responsibility to help businesses in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland to export. Our dedicated nation teams, alongside the Local Enterprise Partners ( LEPs ), will articulate and amplify our offer in each home nation, providing better access to our global network. Our Export Strategy will bolster and complement Wales’s Export Action Plan, Northern Ireland’s 10X Economy and Scotland: A Trading Nation. Our offer will also support business sectors important to the local economies on the world stage through campaigns and by ensuring that UK trade policy reflects the diversity of the UK.  The brilliant endeavours of UK exporters are exemplified by the recipients of the Queen’s Award for Enterprise. This scheme promotes outstanding business achievement in International Trade and other areas. We will use our new local presence around the country to encourage more exporters to apply to the scheme.  By being closer to the communities and businesses we support, our future operations will be based on a better understanding of the challenges faced by local populations and industries.  Case study: Queen’s Award for International Trade Hiretech Limited is a leading, independent equipment rental and personnel supply company, based near Aberdeen in Scotland. “We have enjoyed the success of achieving a Queen’s Award, both in terms of the recognition of the hard work and dedication of our staff, and also the vast promotional and profile-raising opportunities it has created for Hiretech.” – Hiretech  3. Financial support for exporters  We have launched the £37.8 million European Regional Development Fund ( ERDF ) Internationalisation Fund, which provides 7,500 SMEs in England with financial assistance to build their capability to internationalise. We know that UK businesses continue to face a range of barriers to exporting. 57% of UK businesses reported ‘costs’ as a moderate or strong barrier to exporting.[footnote 10]  SMEs can receive matched grant funding of up to £9,000 to support a range of export-related business activities and overcome barriers to trade.  This includes market research, visits, advice to protect UK intellectual property, attendance at trade fairs, translation services, consultancy and more.  This advice and support will provide businesses with the tools they need to create jobs, raise productivity, and thrive overseas.  We’ve listened to business and know you want government grants to be consolidated and more accessible. We have £23 million set aside to support exporters in 2022 and are considering how best to enhance our support offer from 2023 onwards.  Case study: Gordon Rhodes Gordon Rhodes has been in business over 40 years supplying spices and seasonings to retail, meat manufacturers and butchers throughout the UK. After a devastating factory fire Gordon Rhodes were looking to rebuild the brand and one option was to try and sell overseas. Through research they recognised that the US market was strong and consumers there valued UK products, so identified a potential market for their range of products. Gordon Rhodes received support from their International Trade Adviser to access grant funding through the Internationalisation Fund (supported by the European Regional Development Fund). This allowed them to pay for specialist advice to protect their Intellectual Property and packaging designs in the US market. Gordon Rhodes have also attended DIT webinars and events to gain an understanding of various foreign markets. “We would not have been in a position to take advantage of the overseas opportunities without the help and support of DIT.” – Gordon Rhodes  4. UK Export Finance  UKEF , the UK’s world-class export credit agency, will expand availability of its products to better support the finance needs of UK exporters and take advantage of the UK’s new FTAs .  UKEF supports UK exporters and suppliers of goods and services with access to finance and insurance where the private sector is unable to, helping UK business win, fulfil and get paid for international trade. As the economic recovery continues, UKEF will expand its offering, continuing to support exporters and suppliers across the whole of the UK and contributing to economic growth and employment.  Supporting exporters through the economic cycle  The pandemic period has been particularly difficult for businesses, and UKEF has been at the forefront of the government’s response to support companies through the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020 to 2021 6 out of 10 SMEs reported a decline in growth and profitability and the demand for finance increased.[footnote 11] During this period, UKEF saw a significant increase in demand from companies of all sizes, and provided £12.3 billion in finance and insurance for UK exporters and supporting around 107,000 jobs.  Enhancing UKEF ’s offer  Working with the Office for Investment and the UK Infrastructure Bank, UKEF will now support companies’ investment into future UK exports. UKEF ’s Export Development Guarantee ( EDG ) allows UKEF to provide 80% guarantees on loans of £25 million and above to support companies’ general expenditure, including facilities, research and development and general operations. Under this strategy, UKEF will expand eligibility for the EDG to companies that do not currently export, including those that do not have operations in the UK but are seeking finance to establish themselves here and export. By enabling international investment into UK export capabilities, this will support the development of UK supply chains in new high-growth sectors.  Supporting the development of exports in new clean growth sectors and technologies remains a priority. As part of its new commitment to achieving net zero across its portfolio and operations by 2050, UKEF will offer green economy exporters access to increased lending capacity. UKEF will provide its EDG on extended repayment terms so they can seize new export opportunities and invest in future export capacity.  UKEF will ensure that it continues to meet the financing needs of exporters, large and small, across the whole of the UK. To do so, it will work closely with partners from the private sector and with other UK government bodies. This includes the UK’s Development Finance Institution, CDC, and the British Business Bank to enhance export opportunities and ensure partner governments are aware of the full UK financing and investment offer.  Smaller exporters face specific challenges in accessing finance and UKEF has made considerable strides in its support for SMEs in recent years. The General Export Facility ( GEF ) was introduced in 2020 to unlock working capital to support a business’s overall growth, rather than being tied to a specific export contract. UKEF has now increased the amount companies can access automatically from their bank, without the need for separate approval. UKEF is also working to expand its range of delivery partner financial institutions, including challenger banks and alternative lenders, to allow more businesses to access support.  To ensure we can help SMEs offer their buyers attractive payment terms, UKEF will shortly launch a new, simplified Bills and Notes Guarantee. This will allow SME exporters to be paid immediately while a financing bank subsequently seeks payment from the overseas buyer on the basis of bills of exchange or promissory notes. These instruments are more relevant for smaller businesses and lower value exports and can be arranged at lower cost. Alongside the Standard Buyer Loan Guarantee launched earlier this year, this new product means UKEF can effectively support the full range of debt finance instruments SMEs use in international trade.  UKEF also helps SMEs secure opportunities with the large international projects it supports through supplier fairs. These procurement-led events connect contractors and overseas buyers with UK exporters and suppliers. Through its overseas network, UKEF will continue to seek out opportunities to capitalise on demand for world-leading UK goods and services, giving SMEs opportunities they normally wouldn’t have exposure to.  Through its SME -targeted marketing campaign, The Exporter’s Edge, and its network of export finance managers across the UK, UKEF is engaging with business more than ever. When businesses are unable to secure the finance they need to export, they can have the confidence that they can come to UKEF . We are also actively working to build exporter understanding of access to finance by supporting the DIT Export Academy to launch a dedicated finance module in 2022.  Case study: Simworx UKEF supported Simworx, a technology company from Kingswinford, enabling them to complete projects in countries around the world including Malaysia, New Zealand and Vietnam. Through its bank, HSBC, Simworx took advantage of UKEF’s General Export Facility (GEF). Simworx was provided with additional working capital to help finance their export business. Exports constitute approximately 90% of Simworx’s annual turnover and through GEF it has been able to raise advance payment guarantees to secure significant overseas contracts worth up to £8 million. Simworx has built its presence in the Middle East, Far East and Northern Europe and now plans for future expansion in these emerging markets post COVID-19.  5. Government-to-government partnerships ( G2G )  UKEF ’s financial backing will be underpinned by a new G2G provision. Led by DIT , this will ensure that UK businesses can access government business in critical markets around the world.  We know that businesses value partnerships with government, particularly when working in new or unfamiliar markets, and that global demand for government partnerships is growing. UK government teams in Embassies and High Commissions around the world can help by building relationships, and identifying and creating opportunities for major commercial partnerships linked to government-to-government cooperation.  We will focus on strengthening a joint approach, connecting government and business through our global networks.  Our approach will put partnership at its core and, working together with industry, will seek innovative solutions and clean growth approaches. Contributing to the UK’s new Clean and Green Initiative, we will work with partners to address the infrastructure gap in developing countries. Our ambition is to support UK companies where they can really make a difference.  We have taken the first steps in the defence and security sectors and have added financial reinforcement through UKEF ’s support as a vital part of the offer. We can and will go further, broadening our offer to a wider range of sectors.  Case study: Reconstruction with Changes Following severe damage caused by climate cycle El Niño in Peru in 2017, Peru established the Reconstruction with Changes Authority to prioritise the rebuilding of vital infrastructure throughout the country. In summer 2020, DIT signed a G2G agreement with the Government of Peru to support the reconstruction of the country’s public services facilities. The G2G portfolio supported by the UK, valued at £1.7 billion, covers 118 interventions in the nine coastal regions of Peru. The programme’s UK delivery team (Arup, Gleeds and Mace) provides project management capability and technical assistance working side-by-side with the Reconstruction Authority. Our partnership will support the delivery of schools for over 44,500 children and enable healthcare for a population of over 1.45 million citizens. This partnership will also plant 56 million seedlings to support a nature-based solution for flood prevention works and the sequestration of carbon. This programme will implement the world’s largest integrated early warning system.  6. UK Export Academy  Our new UK Export Academy will offer SMEs the chance to learn how to navigate the technicalities of exporting and how to find new opportunities in overseas markets.  To meet our Race to a Trillion ambition, we want to help businesses looking to grow to move from reacting to incoming orders to proactively seeking new export opportunities. Our new Export Academy will help SME exporters meet their growth ambitions by learning directly from experts in international trade. In teaching them how to sell to international customers and secure contracts around the world, the Export Academy will help SMEs set their global ambitions high.  The Export Academy is an online facility available to a wide range of businesses and designed for owners and senior managers of SMEs . The core course of webinars and other virtual events such as masterclasses, mentoring, roundtables and networking events will give SMEs the tools and knowledge they need to start their export journey.  Our foundation course helps build the knowledge and confidence of SMEs that are new to exporting or want to start exporting. This course includes 10 educational online seminars businesses will leave that will help firms create an export action plan tailored to their business.  Our sector faculties will support businesses with sector-specific webinars, masterclasses, and virtual missions. Even more experienced exporters have something to gain from the sector faculties. Our tailored learning will support them to improve their export capabilities and operate effectively in specific foreign markets or sectors. For example, to stimulate space sector opportunities, the Space Sector Export Academy has already completed its first programme supporting SMEs to access the Australian market.  Our market access events will outline the benefits of new market opportunities, including from new free trade agreements.  The Export Academy is open to any business in the UK who has a product or service that can be sold internationally. It is for businesses who want to reach international customers and contracts, whether just starting their export journey or expanding into new markets.  Businesses can register now at events.great.gov.uk/exportacademy.  Case study: Avacare Avacare first approached DIT for help to identify potential target markets, develop an export plan and understand export financing options, as well as for introductions to overseas buyers. With advice from DIT and the local chamber in Singapore, they have secured an export deal in Singapore worth around £220k over 5 years. This contract constitutes an important entry into the Asian market for Avacare. Since the deal, there has been significant growth in the business, with turnover increasing from approximately £40,000 to £325,000 in the last 5 years. Currently, 95% of Avacare’s products are being exported.  7. Our exporting networks across the UK  We will develop our network of Export Champions across the UK. These experienced exporters are ready to offer their time to help businesses grow private sector links through the exporting journey.  We recognise the power of business-to-business networking. DIT ’s Export Champion Community of 1,700 individuals promotes the benefits of exporting amongst their peers and enables us to better understand the needs of business.  Export Champion - Jon Tibbs OBE, Chairman and Founder, Jon Tibbs Associates “Immerse yourself in the culture of your export customers. They will notice and appreciate every effort you make.”  We have handpicked over 400 Export Champions.  These experienced exporters, primarily CEOs, Sales Directors or Export Managers from a wide variety of sectors share their knowledge and personal stories to promote exporting by:  participating as speakers and panel members in programmes such as the Parliamentary Export Programme and Export Academy, providing informal advice and inspiring new potential exporters  featuring in DIT campaigns and media opportunities, and often amplifying these through their own networks  campaigns and media opportunities, and often amplifying these through their own networks hosting ministerial and VIP visits and roundtables  offering business insights to help inform DIT policy  policy in the case of many, undertaking their own activities and media in addition to the opportunities we provide  Case study: Dr. PAWPAW Dr. PAWPAW was created in 2013 when the daughter of its founders, Johnny and Pauline Paterson, was diagnosed with eczema, leading to the need for a natural alternative to normal steroid prescription creams. DIT recommended that the company exhibit at Cosmoprof Bologna in 2015. Through further careful recommendation, guidance and support, DIT has helped Dr. PAWPAW achieve over £1 million in sales. Johnny is now supporting other businesses through DIT’s UK Export Champions network, enabling more businesses to access guidance from experienced traders. “A massive thank you to DIT for its incredible contribution to securing our export business status over the years.” – Dr. PAWPAW  Export Champion - Laura Gunderson, Head of Commercial Development, BigVit’s “Always talk to your local DIT International Trade Adviser, they have a wealth of knowledge and a fantastic network of contacts they can connect you to, to help drive your export strategy forward.”  8. Export Campaign – Made in the UK, Sold to the World  We will extend our hugely successful Export Campaign designed to promote great UK products and services, with the agri-food and drink sector at its core amongst others.  Our new cross-cutting, national export promotion campaign Made in the UK, Sold to the World hosts trade promotion activities across the UK. The campaign engages with businesses and signposts them to the support they need to seize exporting opportunities. Our campaign has already begun with work to celebrate and support exporters in education, agriculture and the creative services. The campaign includes events, masterclasses, webinars, trade missions, ‘Meet the Buyer’ events, businesses roundtables, ministerial visits and much more.  Simultaneously, the GREAT campaign promotes the UK as the preferred supplier of goods and services in international markets. Whilst GREAT focuses on the supply-side, our overseas network with its global reach identifies markets UK businesses can meet. We will connect buyers to UK firms and ensure the smallest businesses from every region can champion Global Britain. We will help both those exporting for the first time and established exporters wanting to grow their market share.  We will open and promote new markets and trade opportunities, so that UK exporters can reap the benefits. We will focus domestically and internationally in the following sectors:  agri-food and drink  financial, professional and business services  creative industries  education  tech and digital  consumer and luxury goods  clean growth  Our objective is to enable economic recovery through exports and create jobs across the UK. Our message to businesses is simple: grow by exporting.  Case study: GeneFirst GeneFirst is a UK molecular diagnostics company focused on infectious diseases, cancer diagnostics and personalised medicine. It is a proactive developer and supplier of RT-PCR COVID-19 kits, including kits for Variants of Concern. “DIT has been very supportive in terms of building the GeneFirst brand awareness by introducing the organisation to potential distributors in regions deemed key targets for GeneFirst – in particular, Europe and South America. We believe this to have an impact for GeneFirst in increasing visibility and market reach for our other portfolios, including cervical cancer screening and Next Generation Sequencing for oncology testing.” – GeneFirst  9. Piloting a new UK Tradeshow Programme  International tradeshows are an invaluable opportunity for businesses to showcase their products to consumers and partners. Particularly for SMEs , tradeshows are a critical platform to access international markets. The networks developed at international tradeshows, often between innovative and established businesses, can be vital to developing sales and stimulating growth.  We want to ensure that we have the best programme in place to equip goods and services exporters to succeed in these platforms. We therefore plan to launch a new UK Tradeshow Programme ( UKTP ) until April 2023. The UKTP will be launched as a pilot to allow us to work with business to assess different approaches to encouraging businesses’ participation at overseas tradeshows through training.  UKTP is a service which aims to support UK-based SMEs to understand the benefits of exhibiting at overseas tradeshows and how they can maximise on their participation. We will support businesses in 2 ways.  Firstly, by supporting them with training and with grants to attend key tradeshows as a precursor to making the decision to exhibit there – so the business can decide how best to use the show in future.  Secondly, through the provision of essential market knowledge from trade experts to ensure that businesses exhibiting at some of the world’s most prestigious tradeshows can make the most out of showcasing their quality products and services. Some businesses will also receive a grant of up to £4,000 to count towards eligible exhibition costs.  Participants in the programme will receive both generic and event-specific training on how to make the most of tradeshows.  SMEs can apply to take part in UKTP through a new, simplified digital platform, making it easier for businesses across the UK to apply, and for DIT to monitor the pilot scheme’s effectiveness and ensure we can deliver the best support for business.  DIT is committed to working in partnership with trade associations, which have a vital role in supporting their industries. We have a joint goal of supporting businesses as they recover from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.  DIT also continues to run overseas trade missions across a large variety of sectors and markets. These are designed to boost growing bilateral trade ties, demonstrating what British businesses have to offer on the global stage. This year, we have run missions highlighting tech and digital, fintech, food and drink, healthcare and life sciences and clean growth industries, to name just a few.  UK-based tradeshows are another route to attracting export business. One such tradeshow is Security and Policing (S&P), led by the Home Office, now approaching its 40th year. International delegations attend S&P to see first-hand UK security capabilities that might help address capability gaps in their nation state, thereby creating export opportunities for UK companies. “We have been exhibiting at Security and Policing for over 5 years. During that time, we have seen a significant growth in our overseas business and the show has undoubtedly contributed to that success.” – cellXion Ltd  10. Making exporting easier  The trade agreements we negotiate with other governments can make exporting easier. But we will also make conditions for trade easier for businesses by putting exporting at the heart of our own UK government policies and programmes. We will do this by making our borders and trade processes work smoothly and seamlessly and ensuring our approach to regulation supports trade.  Better regulation  Transparent and effective regulation will help DIT to conclude FTAs and maintain the UK’s global reputation as a good place to do business for exporters. As part of the UK’s new global trading freedom, we will prioritise innovation, competition, growth and inward investment. We will continue to build upon the UK’s global reputation for leadership in setting the highest standards of environmental, social and consumer protection. We have taken a whole of government approach to supporting businesses.  In addition, the Professional Qualifications Bill, currently going through Parliament, enables the government to empower regulators to strike deals on the recognition of professional qualifications with overseas counterparts, boosting UK businesses exporting services. It will also revoke EU-derived laws to give more autonomy to UK regulators to decide on the right approach to the recognition of overseas professional qualifications, tailored to suit the needs of their profession.  Case study: Freeports Freeports will play a significant role in boosting trade, attracting inward investment and driving productive activity across all areas of the UK. They will create high-skilled jobs in ports and the areas around them, prioritising some of our most deprived communities to level up the UK economy. Producers based in freeports will benefit from tax reliefs on capital investment, business rates and national insurance within freeport sites, alongside duty deferrals, inversions, VAT relief and simpler customs processes within customs sites – with the potential to enable re-exporting to international markets. Through this combination of special customs zones, tax reliefs at tax sites, and a wide range of other support, UK freeports will empower UK businesses to make the most of their exporting opportunities.  Regulatory diplomacy  We will use regulatory diplomacy overseas to share and influence global norms, regulations and standards, to improve market access for UK exporters, particularly in sectors critical to the UK’s future economic growth. We will tackle the regulations and standards required for exports that increasingly integrate digital and data, protecting and increasing market access. We will leverage the UK’s reputation as a leader and innovator in standards setting, and promote our approach of including UK businesses and industry in the standard setting process. We will also promote further regulatory co-operation internationally and between Commonwealth members, and other close trading partners.  Development cooperation  Our overseas development programmes led by the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office ( FCDO ) help to improve the environment for trade in developing countries and emerging economies, benefitting local businesses as well as UK exporters and investors. We support markets to develop through co-operation on areas such as standards, regulations, infrastructure, economic management and financial markets, helping to improve economic growth and flows of trade and investment. This helps developing countries to reduce poverty, while also creating a more conducive environment for UK businesses to operate and improving the resilience and quality of supply chains.  2025 UK Border Strategy  Our ambition is for the UK border to be the best in the world. A major part of this is helping to ensure that the practical barriers to exporting are as low as possible.  In 2020, the UK government published the 2025 UK Border Strategy establishing transformations to the UK border that the Cabinet Office, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and government will ensure as the most effective and efficient in the world. As part of this, relevant departments are developing the Single Trade Window ( STW ), a single gateway for all data from traders into government. This streamlining of how businesses interact with the UK border will ease the business burden through efficiency and cost savings.  Through the UK’s new points-based immigration system, we are creating Skilled Worker, Global Talent and Health and Care visa routes, and suspending caps on skilled workers. Bespoke immigration routes will enable more students, scientists, academics, investors and entrepreneurs to come to the UK and contribute to our economic growth. The new system will also support companies, including SMEs , in high-growth sectors to recruit the right people into the right roles.  Digital trade  Innovation in trade facilitation does not stop at the border. We want trade between businesses and across borders to be easier, more digital and seamless. Digital trade is crucial to transforming the way in which commerce is transacted worldwide.  Internationally, we are leading the way through our trade policy. We are concluding a Digital Economy Agreement with Singapore. To go further at home, government will legislate, when parliamentary time allows, to introduce electronic trade records for B2B trade. This will streamline the process for business by removing the need for paper documents for some trade documentation. As well as increasing the efficiency of business interactions with the border, it will also directly support driving down costs, increasing security and would reducing our carbon footprint.  Our Digital Exporting Programme, which has helped thousands of businesses grow their global market digitally, will continue supporting companies through our digital trade and ecommerce experts, tools and global network of partners.  The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport’s ( DCMS ) tech sector team works to ensure that digital businesses can grow and thrive in the UK before expanding to other markets. This is achieved through access to finance, talent and markets, strategic communications campaigns, and the work of Tech Nation, which serves to generate confidence in the sector. We will also continue to support the development of Digital Boost, an organisation that provides small businesses and charities with pro bono digital advice from a network of over 2,000 digital experts.  11. Our global reach  We will strengthen our support in markets overseas to provide the networks of skilled advisers needed to support our critical exporting sectors.  Led by Her Majesty’s Ambassadors, High Commissioners and 9 Trade Commissioners, UK government staff around the world will contribute to levelling up in the UK. We will open markets, build global partnerships across sectors of UK strength, and help to grow the markets for UK goods and services through our overseas aid programme.  We will connect UK companies to buyers and ensure the tools of government are employed to support exporters to succeed in their journey. Our activities across the globe will seek to increase the competitiveness of existing exporters as well as facilitate the engagement of new businesses. We will continue to work to promote outward investment opportunities, which are vital to establishing new supply chains and export opportunities for UK firms.  The Prime Minister has appointed 33 Trade Envoys to raise our export potential. Appointed from Parliament and across the political spectrum, Trade Envoys strengthen the UK’s commercial ties in markets across the globe. Whether leading trade delegations or meeting foreign governments, they will work to ensure that UK businesses including SMEs can compete on the world stage and seize the export opportunity of the next decade.  This effort is complemented by an expert global network of International Export Finance Executives. This network brings local market, commercial and political knowledge together with UKEF support to change the way exporters can access markets. UKEF will expand this network from 15 to 30, based in important regional hubs such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Morocco, and the Balkans.  The UK government, in our Embassies, High Commissions and Consulates, works as one team to promote the interests of the UK. From collaboration in defence, migration, or science and technology, to advising businesses on the political and economic environment, or leveraging long-developed partnerships in growth sectors for the UK, we are working as one HMG to open opportunities for UK businesses. Our development finance and investment support complement this, promoting growth and poverty reduction in developing markets.  In the fastest growing tech markets of the Asia Pacific region, the UK’s new Digital Trade Network is increasing the UK’s technology expertise on the ground. Powered by a talented network of trade experts and Tech Nation’s new international programmes, it adds an extra level of support to UK tech companies seeking to export to this exciting region. This network focuses on providing expert trade support, supporting the adoption of digital technology; and creating new regulatory space for future British innovations.  Under this strategy the FCDO is planning to roll out its British Support for Infrastructure Projects ( BSIP ) programme, formerly known as the Developing Markets Infrastructure Programme ( DMIP ). This programme will help low income and lower-middle income countries to prepare, procure and finance high-quality, developmental public infrastructure projects that require funding support. BSIP will target sectors and geographies of UK strategic interest to take advantage of both developmental and trade objectives and can be blended with export credits including from UKEF . BSIP will help to level out the playing field with other countries’ concessional finance offers.  Outward direct investment case study: Konexa, Nigeria Konexa is pioneering a new energy service model to improve the energy service provided to consumers and businesses. In Nigeria, Konexa has deployed its ground-breaking integrated distribution model and upgraded 6,600 existing energy connections and 1,100 new energy connections. The £65 million investment will break the vicious cycle of under-investment in transmission and distribution and will do so drawing on mainly renewable sources of hydro and solar, connecting off-grid customers through least-cost technology. This project will create an estimated 75 permanent jobs directly and indirectly and reflects an important export into the Nigerian market. DIT will support Konexa to reach 10 more viable states across Nigeria and is currently mapping out other viable African countries in need of Konexa’s intervention.  12. Opening markets worldwide  We will continue to open new markets for UK exporters through free trade deals, addressing market access barriers identified by business and reforming the international trading system.  Leaving the EU has given the UK the opportunity to implement an independent trade policy for the first time in nearly 50 years. The UK can now pursue its own trade agreements, aimed squarely at making it easier for UK businesses to trade and securing access for UK exporters into overseas markets.  The UK has already negotiated trade agreements with 70 countries plus the EU.[footnote 12] These countries accounted for £766 billion of UK bilateral trade in 2020.[footnote 13] We will ensure UK businesses can take advantage of them by promoting the preferential terms, considering where we can simplify processes, and monitoring uptake. We will also continue our engagement with these countries once the deals have been done to secure the benefits for UK business. We will monitor and enhance the agreements we have and resolve any issues. We will seek opportunities to review and upgrade our existing agreements, starting with our FTAs with Canada and Mexico, to further tailor them to the benefit of the UK.  Our work doesn’t just stop there – we are pursuing an ambitious programme of new trade agreements, including in the fastest growing Indo-Pacific region. By the end of 2022, we aim for 80% of UK trade to be covered by existing and new trade agreements, giving more UK businesses access to preferential trading terms. We will negotiate new deals and build relationships with our trading partners to break down barriers to trade and support growth, jobs, and wages, with a particular focus on helping SMEs .  We have already reached Agreement in Principle on trade deals with Australia and New Zealand, and we are continuing to work towards a future full free trade agreement with the US. We have consulted on and are currently preparing for trade negotiations with India and hope to commence these before the end of the year. We have also launched a public consultation to help inform our approach for starting negotiations on a trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council in the future.  The UK is on the pathway to membership of the CPTPP – one of the largest free trade areas in the world. CPTPP spans Asia Pacific and the Americas and includes some of the world’s biggest current and future economies which collectively represented 13% of global GDP in 2020.[footnote 14] Accession could see 99.9% of UK exports being eligible for tariff-free trade with CPTPP members – including on whisky and cars – goods which are in high demand in the Pacific region. With CPTPP countries projected to account for 25% of global import demand for meat products by the end of the decade,[footnote 15] this could for example mean more British beef and lamb to Vietnam and Mexico.  Our trade agreements with developing countries (economic partnership agreements) and our new improved trade preference scheme are under design. The Developing Countries Trading Scheme will help developing countries access UK markets, grow their economies and reduce poverty while also enabling British businesses and exporters to have access to a wider range of imports at lower prices.  We have also replaced the EU’s Common External Tariff with the UK Global Tariff ( UKGT ), which is tailored to the needs of the UK economy, and scraps red tape and unnecessary barriers to trade.  Our preferential trade agreements and UKGT are designed to improve access for UK business to a greater range of intermediate inputs and final products. This increased access to imports and integration into global supply chains supports businesses to export competitively.  In parallel with our trade agreements, we will continue to resolve specific market access barriers identified by UK businesses wherever they arise, so that they can trade and invest more freely. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) estimates that for most economies, the costs associated with non-tariff barriers are between double and ten times those associated with tariffs.[footnote 16] Government analysis of a set of OECD studies suggests that substantial liberalisation of market access barriers by just the G20 countries could boost UK exports by around £75 billion per year.[footnote 17]  To unlock this potential, we work in close partnership with business to identify market access barriers, and, once resolved, to raise awareness of these new openings around the world. The ESS will only make this easier for businesses from across the UK to benefit from this whole of government effort led by DIT . This work is particularly important in helping businesses reach emerging markets, where barriers are usually more common and harder to overcome without specific intervention.  Finally, we will work globally with partner countries to champion free and fair trade under rules fit for the 21st century. Safeguarding and championing the multilateral framework is crucial to our exporting success as it creates a global environment where businesses are treated fairly and can compete on merit. We will work multilaterally to strengthen the international trading system and reform the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) to update the global trading rules in support of free and fair trade. We will continue further liberalisation, promoting openness and co-operation in the face of collective challenges, including through our G7 Presidency.  Our vision for sectors  Our trading potential is core to our vision of an open, dynamic and productive economy, particularly in sectors where UK firms are leading the world: tech, clean economy, digital and creative. We will provide sector-specific support to innovative, high growth companies to expand internationally. The Export Strategy will augment our Innovation Strategy to propel our sectors into priority markets across the globe. By doing so we will not only be successful commercially but demonstrate our position as a science superpower.  Whether it’s harnessing the UK’s strengths in manufacturing, and supporting UK goods to reach buyers across the globe, or easing and enhancing services trade – the Export Strategy delivers for exporters of all kinds.  We will partner with industry to increase UK supply chain competitiveness through supplier development and increased opportunities for UK suppliers to bid for work in these major supply chains. This will increase UK prosperity, creating jobs and opportunities across the UK.  Services  Services contribute to around 80% of UK GDP each year,[footnote 18] and accounted for 49% of exports in 2020.[footnote 19] The UK has particular strengths in digital services, including financial, creative and media, education and training, telecoms, professional and consultancy services. We will improve access to new markets, promote services trade through campaigns, and support the launch of a new Trade in Services Council ( TISC ) with business.  Tourism  Travel services was the UK’s third largest services export sector in 2019, driven by £28 billion in direct visitor spend, making the UK the fifth most valuable destination worldwide in terms of inbound visitor spend.[footnote 20] Pre-pandemic, tourism directly contributed £74 billion to the economy, directly supporting over 1.7 million jobs, increasing to over 4 million including the wider supply chain.[footnote 21] The Tourism Recovery Plan sets out a comprehensive framework for rebuilding the sector and building back better.  Case study: Luminance The UK-Australia FTA includes ambitious commitments to increase opportunities for digital trade, reduce regulatory obstacles and increase transparency. This is an exciting development for UK Lawtech businesses such as Luminance, a firm which uses artificial intelligence and advanced machine learning techniques to read and form an understanding of legal documents. Lawtech activity in Australia is significant, and, in 2020, Luminance saw a 60% increase in the uptake of its technology firms based in the Asia Pacific region. Luminance is confident that the Australia FTA will bring strategic opportunities for Lawtech companies in the UK, ensuring it is the most attractive market to do business with.  Creative sector  British talent is renowned worldwide, and demand will continue to grow. Whether in television, film, music, design or gaming, the UK is world-leading in this growing sector. The government’s partnership with industry, including the British Fashion Council and British Phonographic Industry, will showcase the Best of British across all creative sectors on the world stage, opening new markets and opportunities for exporters to thrive in.  Financial, professional and business services  The UK was the world’s second largest net exporter of financial services,[footnote 22] exporting £62 billion in 2020[footnote 23] and is a global leader in fintech making up around 10% of the global market.[footnote 24] Professional and business services exports have risen dramatically from £48 billion in 2016 to £63 billion in 2019.[footnote 25] We will work with sector partners and trade bodies to encourage more financial and professional services firms to trade and grow internationally. We will also help those who already trade to grow business in new overseas growth markets.  Digital commerce and ecommerce  Digital commerce and ecommerce are transforming the global economic landscape and the way transactions are made internationally. We support a wide range of UK service-based businesses in their ambitions to internationalise digitally so they can take advantage of growth opportunities and meet competition in an increasingly digital world.  Agriculture  The agriculture, food and drink sector, including the UK’s largest manufacturing industry, contributes £127 billion to the UK economy in 2019 and supporting around 4 million jobs.[footnote 26] We will combat the barriers faced by our exporters, building on the success of securing beef exports to the United States, and we will support firms to adjust to new markets and compete worldwide.  Defence and security  Ensuring UK companies have effective market intelligence and can match our competitors will be crucial to internationalising the Defence and Security Industrial Strategy. We will project SMEs across the defence and security sectors globally, using our unique network of defence and security relationships around the world, and enabling the UK to remain at the forefront of defence innovation in both sectors. We will also support the growth of the UK’s cyber security ecosystem through exports.  Maritime and shipbuilding  With a proud history as a maritime nation, we will capitalise on the maritime sector to capture a significant global market share. We will also promote important technologies to improve the environmental performance of the global maritime fleet. We will generate an innovative and internationally competitive UK maritime offer, leveraging major UK strengths such as defence and low carbon technologies. The National Shipbuilding Office and future DIT export and investment initiatives will galvanise and promote the UK’s shipbuilding enterprise. This will help us become a world leader in new areas such as the green maritime sector.  Clean growth  Over the past 30 years, the UK has been at the forefront of the transition to green and will continue to be so with our Net Zero and Jet Zero ambitions. Whilst the opportunity for the UK is unprecedented, it is by no means guaranteed. The low-carbon economy has the potential to create £60 to 170 billion of export sales between 2015 and 2030.[footnote 27] We will capitalise on this opportunity by building export capability at home and opening markets abroad. Our new trade agreements and our multilateral trade policy will also reflect this ambition by seeking to open up new opportunities for low-carbon exports.  Aerospace  The UK civil aerospace sector is a world leader in the design, manufacture and support of wings, engines, advanced systems and components for civil passenger aircraft. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK aerospace sector (defence and civil) had an annual turnover of around £33 billion, with over 90% of products exported.[footnote 28] Our priority markets for promoting exports and securing investment are the US, Canada, Brazil and Europe. We will continue to focus our efforts here with major players such as Boeing, Airbus, Embraer, GE, Raytheon Technologies and Safran.  Case study: Boeing Prosperity Partnership 2021 marks the 5-year anniversary of the long-term partnering initiative for UK growth and prosperity between Boeing and the UK government across the aerospace, defence and space sectors. The programme has been designed to increase UK exports to the US, increase volume of UK content on Boeing programmes and promote Boeing investment into the UK. The partnership has delivered significant achievements, including £11 billion supply chain spend with 300 suppliers, 500 supplier teams attending Boeing industry events and UK suppliers being selected for new Boeing programmes. It has also enabled £200 million investment in new infrastructure projects, including Boeing’s first European manufacturing facility in Sheffield, and an 8-fold increase in R&D collaborations with SMEs.  Space  The UK’s space sector is already a strong exporter, with £5.8 billion of its £16.4 billion income generated through exports (year 2018 to 2019).[footnote 29] The UK seeks to build one of the most innovative and attractive space economies in the world. We will continue to develop new and innovative partnerships, like Space Bridges, with priority markets in North America, Europe, the Gulf, and Indo-Pacific.  Automotive  The UK has one of Europe’s most competitive car-making industries. Around 80% of the UK’s finished vehicles are exported to 150 markets and the sector generated £30 billion in exports in 2020.[footnote 30] Successfully transitioning to making zero-emission vehicles is critical to the future prosperity of the UK automotive sector. We will continue to support the automotive decarbonisation agenda through export orientated FDI to build resilience and competitiveness among UK manufacturers.  Education  The UK is recognised as a world leader in high quality education and skills. In 2018, education exports and transnational education activity contributed £23.3 billion to the UK economy.[footnote 31] The UK government’s International Education Strategy sets clear ambitions to achieve £35 billion in education exports per year and to sustainably recruit over 600,000 international students studying in the UK per year, both by 2030. Alongside the UK’s International Education Champion, Professor Sir Steve Smith, we will continue to deepen partnerships, promote export opportunities and address market barriers.  Infrastructure  Modern, high-quality infrastructure is essential for economic development, a healthy environment and people’s quality of life. UK companies are amongst the best in the world in developing and delivering infrastructure as demonstrated through high-profile megaprojects, including Crossrail, London 2012 Olympics, Heathrow Terminal 5 and High Speed 1 (HS1). Our Infrastructure Exports:UK initiative brings together government and industry to form a ‘Team UK’ approach to opportunities, prioritising markets where infrastructure pipelines complement UK strengths.  Case study: Tel Aviv Metro Since September 2020, Crossrail International (CI) has been providing strategic advisory and consultancy services to Israeli Government agency, NTA Metropolitan Mass Transit System. NTA is responsible for the delivery of the Tel Aviv Metro, a £33 billion, three-line underground network for the Tel Aviv metropolis. CI is also leading the development of UK-Israeli relations in the infrastructure sector, opening doors for other UK suppliers to enter the market. In association with the British Embassy, CI hosted a client forum onboard HMS Richmond, part of the UK’s Carrier Strike Group, at Haifa port.  Life sciences, healthcare and chemicals  Life sciences, including elements of healthcare and chemicals, is a diverse sector which also includes a large SME base, and one of the UK’s top exporters. Exports of medicines and pharmaceuticals alone was valued at £21 billion in 2020, 6.9% of total exports.[footnote 32] This is second only to exports of cars.[footnote 33] The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of the life sciences sector in achieving global economic recovery. The UK has potential for high growth in exports of both goods and services in this sector, including solutions to ease the global burden of chronic diseases and achieve healthier longevity. These play into the UK’s strengths as a science superpower and will drive a digital revolution in life sciences R&D and healthcare delivery.  Technology  The digital and technology sectors are a major strength of the UK. We are the leading European nation for building emerging tech businesses. In 2019, the value of services exported by the digital sector was £51.9 billion, and £17.4 billion of goods. [footnote 34] The continued growth of the sector relies on success in international markets. We will continue to provide a range of activities to support this sector, such as our Technology Growth Programme, which provides market understanding for entrepreneurs. Engaging with colleagues around the globe, we will ensure UK technology and digital companies are accessing the right opportunities at the right stage of their development.  Case study: the exporting potential of venture capital backed firms To support the UK’s agenda as a science superpower, in summer 2021 DIT piloted a programme to align DIT export support with a cohort of innovative UK companies which had received venture capital investment. Working with both investors and their portfolio companies, DIT identified, engaged and has begun to support these companies to access market opportunities in the USA, Australia and India. Companies on the programme had access to DIT resources via a dedicated account manager. The pilot engaged over 200 businesses and investors and is planned for expansion in 2022. The next phase of work will expand the criteria for support to include those companies receiving substantial innovation grants, patents and strategic sectors.  Our vision for markets  We will put the UK at the centre of a network of modern deals spanning the Americas and Pacific. In doing so, we will connect Global Britain to the markets of tomorrow, strengthen our bonds with our closest partners, including Commonwealth countries, and build UK exports in developing markets. We will continue to deepen our trading relationships with some of our closest allies, including the United States and the European Union. These markets are ready to trade, and we will continue to promote exporters across them.  Rapidly growing emerging markets offer new opportunities for UK trade over the next decade. To put the UK at the centre of future global growth, the majority of which is outside the EU, we must look to markets of the future. Almost 90% of world growth is expected to be outside the EU over the next 5 years.[footnote 35] The future of the global economy lies to the east in the Indo-Pacific. By 2030, 65% of the world’s 5.4 billion middle class consumers are expected to be in Asia.[footnote 36]  Our existing trade partners are important to us. We will continue to strengthen the support we offer exporters to these countries and regions.  We can use trade as an engine of economic transformation that allows developing countries to reduce poverty sustainably and exit from aid dependency. Our ODA programmes help build the capability of countries to engage in trade and investment, meet global standards and improve economic governance. They also help to build more competitive and inclusive markets, deliver better and cleaner infrastructure, overcome non-tariff barriers, empower women and tackle economic exclusion. We will complement this with a new focus on supporting exporters bidding for government contracts through G2G activity and support to help UK businesses capitalise on export opportunities flowing from ODA programmes. We will set out our wider approach through the new International Development Strategy.  Case study: Growth Gateway Led by the FCDO and DIT, the Growth Gateway is a business support service that provides dedicated, specialist advice and technical support to promote trade and investment between UK and African businesses. Through a digital portal on GOV.UK, it will connect businesses with the wide range of UK government advice and financial support available, as well as providing in-person support and market information to businesses in the UK and Africa.  Modernising trade  Our Export Strategy and 12-point plan reflects our aspiration to be a major trading nation, prosperous through trade and investment and influential as a proponent of free trade, open markets and the rules-based international system.  Our trading aspirations are underpinned by our values and as we Build Back Better, we must do so in a way that showcases the values of Global Britain. We take pride in our values, which align to exporting best practices and which we will uphold and reflect in our trade agreements. Our independent trade policy will help ensure protections for UK consumers and workers are upheld, building on our existing international obligations. We will not compromise our commitments to protecting the environment and tackling climate change.  Environmental  We are committed to safeguarding the environment. Between 1990 and 2019, the UK has reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 44% while growing the economy by 76%.[footnote 37] Trade growth and emissions reduction are not alternatives. The green transformation is critical to the growth of the new green economy that will sustain and rebuild communities through new jobs and improved quality of life.  Our aim is to help foster high-value jobs in the low-carbon economy, propelling sustainable growth in all parts of the UK, and fuelling technological innovations that can be exported to the world. At COP26, we demonstrated our ambition to proactively work towards the Prime Minister’s 10 Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution. Our new trade agreements and our multilateral trade policy will also reflect this ambition by seeking to open up new opportunities for low-carbon exports.  Complementing these efforts, UKEF has committed to net zero emissions across its portfolio and operations by 2050, and is enhancing its green finance product offering. Alongside an enhanced EDG that will allow for longer-term financing for clean growth sector exporters, the Transition EDG will support companies investing in their transition to low-carbon business. Finally, a new, dedicated Renewables and Transition underwriting team is already offering specialist support and financing for customers looking to build their export business in the green economy.  Case study: UKEF backs £430 million green transition loan for Wood Plc In August 2021, UKEF announced the first ever government-backed green transition loan. It was awarded to the engineering and consultancy firm Wood to seize new clean growth export opportunities. A £430 million commercial loan will be supported by an 80% UKEF Transition EDG. This loan will give Wood the financial resources to enhance its clean growth plans, capitalise on green opportunities and support jobs.  Social  We are committed to championing equality and promoting opportunity for all. Our success will only be realised if the benefits of exporting are felt by business and the public across the whole of the UK. We will continue to ensure our trade supports environments which respect workers’ rights, and will work with our trading partners to uphold labour standards.  The G7 – under the UK’s Presidency – has looked at forced labour in a trade context for the first time. As a result, G7 Trade Ministers are identifying areas for strengthened co-operation and collective efforts towards eradicating the use of all forms of forced labour in global supply chains.  The government is committed to promoting women’s economic empowerment. We will build on our prior work to harness the potential for trade to support greater participation by women and under-represented groups, including disabled people, in the economy.  This will be underpinned by improving our data on diversity and inclusion in international trade. We will support initiatives and listen to what our stakeholders have to say so that we can ensure equality of opportunity across the UK.  Black, Asian and other ethnic minority owned businesses We understand the importance of equal access to opportunities for businesses. According to data from a recent study ‘Alone together: Entrepreneurship and diversity in the UK’ by the British Business Bank and Oliver Wyman, there are persistent disparities in outcomes for Black, Asian and other minority-owned businesses. The findings include: over one third of Black, Asian and other ethnic minority female business owners report making no profit last year, versus 15% of White female business owners  49% of Black entrepreneurs say they met their non-financial aims versus 53% of Asian and other ethnic minority entrepreneurs and 69% of White entrepreneurs We are committed to understanding and addressing the barriers faced by Black, Asian and other ethnic minority business owners, and providing the resources available to support these businesses with their exporting efforts.  Governance  We are committed to upholding rules based trade. The UK has been consistently clear that we will negotiate agreements that address the trade-distorting effects of corruption on global trade and fair competition.  We are positively considering how trade policy can complement our already strong anti-corruption measures and the ambitions set out in the government’s 2017 to 2022 Anti-Corruption Strategy. We continue to be actively involved in the influential OECD Working Group on Bribery, the G20 Anti-Corruption Working Group and other multilateral institutions supporting their work on anti-corruption policy and principles. UKEF routinely undertakes rigorous due diligence, including checks against financial crime (bribery, corruption, fraud and money laundering) and safeguarding taxpayers’ funds.  Implementing the strategy  We will implement this Export Strategy in partnership with industry and our regional and sectoral trade associations, through the ecosystem of export facilitation, advisory and finance services.  Our action-focused plan will underpin our ambitions for businesses and the country as we continually improve our service offer, providing:  Better Support – transforming our service offering to exporters, being more joined up and more digital to reach SMEs at scale  Better Access to Finance – ensuring no viable export fails due to lack of finance or insurance  A Better Business Environment – making it easier to export and raising the competitiveness of all UK exporters  Better Data – harnessing new technologies and legal powers to target support, inform policy and identify export opportunities  We will begin establishing the governance needed to effectively implement the Export Strategy across government. We will employ existing HMG governance established to monitor implementation progress and seek to further ensure that international trade is considered in domestic policy making.  We will work through our regular engagement fora with business to discuss the implementation of the strategy, identify barriers to delivery and develop innovative policy interventions for exports. We will take on your feedback to iteratively develop the strategy and implement it. We will work together to monitor and evaluate the outcomes of our interventions.  We will also support the creation of a Trade in Services Council, run in partnership with industry, to draw together the wide range of representative organisations and companies from across the sector. The Trade in Services Council will run for 2 years, and will establish a common voice, shared ambition and create a greater impact for the future of service trade.  We will implement the strategy through trade plans, which will be delivered with DIT teams in all parts of the UK and the government’s overseas network to achieve the Export Strategy’s priorities. We will ensure that this strategy joins up with ongoing work across all parts of the UK and the trade plans of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Since 2017, DIT has developed a new monitoring and evaluation framework for its export promotion activities. This includes annual client surveys to track user experience and satisfaction, bespoke evaluations and a value-for-money model for DIT services. The framework has been carefully scrutinised by the National Audit Office, uses the latest appraisal and evaluation techniques, and has steadily improved the evidence on the influence of export promotion support.  DIT ’s priority outcomes and metrics  We will deliver, monitor and evaluate the strategy against the metrics as set out in the government’s Outcome Delivery Plans.  Priority outcome: secure world-class free trade agreements and reduce market access barriers, ensuring that consumers and businesses can benefit from both[footnote 38]  The performance metrics are:  UK trade with countries with which the UK has concluded a free trade agreement ( FTA ), as a percentage of total UK trade  ), as a percentage of total UK trade predicted GDP impact of each concluded FTA as per published impact assessment, including by UK nation and region  impact of each concluded as per published impact assessment, including by UK nation and region reduction in tariff barriers for each concluded FTA , as per published impact assessment (per cent)  , as per published impact assessment (per cent) cost reductions related to non-tariff measures (NTMs) for goods and services for each concluded FTA , as per published impact assessment (per cent) [footnote 39]  , as per published impact assessment (per cent) number of market access barriers reported and resolved on the Digital Market Access Service  Priority outcome: support UK business to take full advantage of trade opportunities, including those arising from delivering FTAs , facilitating UK exports  The performance metrics are:  value of exports supported (£)  export client survey satisfaction rates and number of service deliveries  total value of UK exports, including by UK nation and region (£)  UK outward foreign direct investment stock (£)  utilisation rate of trade preferences for tariff reductions (per cent)  survey estimates of the barriers faced by UK businesses to exporting, and the extent to which government services alleviated these barriers  Better data will underpin our implementation  The improved creation, adoption and utilisation of data is critical to our iterative approach to services in this strategy. Data sharing legislation within the new Trade Act will allow us to monitor and evaluate the outcomes of our Export Strategy interventions and improve our understanding of the exporter landscape.  Becoming more data-driven will ensure we shift from a demand-led model to a proactive one. We will use better data to identify areas of the UK that need government support, internationalise the government’s priority sectors and determine the markets of tomorrow.  While this is the central government approach, we recognise and support individual trade strategies from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which will complement this approach with more bespoke account management.  Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs )  The United Nations declared 2020-2030, a ‘Decade of Action’ and called ‘for the accelerating sustainable solutions to all the world’s biggest challenges’. We are answering this call.","Made in the UK, Sold to the World (web version)",true,307151533892901483648643944423164905471

Powell, former Joint Chiefs chairman and secretary of state, has died from COVID-19 complications. In an announcement on social media Monday, the family said Powell had been fully vaccinated. He was 84. (AP Photo/Marcy Nighswander, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Colin Powell, the trailblazing soldier and diplomat whose sterling reputation of service to Republican and Democratic presidents was stained by his faulty claims to justify the 2003 U.S. war in Iraq, died Monday of COVID-19 complications. He was 84.  A veteran of the Vietnam War, Powell spent 35 years in the Army and rose to the rank of four-star general before becoming the first Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. His oversight of the U.S. invasion of Kuwait to oust the Iraqi army in 1991 made him a household name, prompting speculation for nearly a decade that he might run for president, a course he ultimately decided against.  He instead joined President George W. Bush’s administration in 2001 as secretary of state, the first Black person to represent the U.S. government on the world stage. Powell’s tenure, however, was marred by his 2003 address to the United Nations Security Council in which he cited faulty information to claim that Saddam Hussein had secretly stashed weapons of mass destruction. Such weapons never materialized, and though the Iraqi leader was removed, the war devolved into years of military and humanitarian losses.  Powell was fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, his family said. But he faced several ailments, telling Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward over the summer that he had Parkinson’s disease. Powell’s longtime aide, Peggy Cifrino, said Monday that he was also treated over the past few years for multiple myeloma, a blood cancer that impairs the body’s ability to fight infection. Studies have shown that those cancer patients don’t get as much protection from the COVID-19 vaccines as healthier people.  In a Washington where partisan divisions run deep, Democrats and Republicans recalled Powell fondly. Flags were ordered lowered at government buildings, including the White House, Pentagon and State Department.  President Joe Biden said Powell “embodied the highest ideals of both warrior and diplomat.”  Noting Powell’s rise from a childhood in a fraying New York City neighborhood, Biden said: “He believed in the promise of America because he lived it. And he devoted much of his life to making that promise a reality for so many others.”  Powell’s time as secretary of state was largely defined by the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. He was the first American official to publicly blame Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaida network. He made a lightning trip to Pakistan to demand that then-Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf cooperate with the United States in going after the Afghanistan-based group, which also had a presence in Pakistan, where bin Laden was later killed.  But as the push for war in Iraq deepened, Powell sometimes found himself at odds with other key figures in the Bush administration, including Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Rumsfeld also died this year.  Powell’s State Department was dubious of the military and intelligence communities’ conviction that Saddam possessed or was developing weapons of mass destruction. But he presented the administration’s case that Saddam posed a major regional and global threat in a strong speech to the U.N. Security Council in February 2003. The following month, Bush gave the go-ahead for the invasion.  The U.N. speech, complete with Powell’s display of a vial of what he said could have been a biological weapon, was seen as a low point in his career, although he had removed some elements from the remarks that he deemed to have been based on poor intelligence assessments.  The U.S. overthrow of Saddam ended the rule of a brutal dictator. But the power vacuum and lawlessness that followed unleashed years of sectarian fighting and chaos that killed countless Iraqi civilians, sparked a lengthy insurgency, and unintentionally tilted the balance of power in the Middle East toward a U.S. rival, Iran. No Iraqi weapons of mass destruction were ever found.  Still, Powell maintained in a 2012 interview with The Associated Press that on balance, the U.S. succeeded in Iraq.  “I think we had a lot of successes,” he said. “Iraq’s terrible dictator is gone.”  Saddam was captured by U.S. forces while hiding out in northern Iraq in December 2003 and was later executed by the Iraqi government. But the war dragged on. President Barack Obama pulled U.S. troops out of Iraq in 2011, but he sent advisers back in 2014 after the Islamic State group swept into the country from Syria and captured large swaths of territory.  Bush said Monday that he and former first lady Laura Bush were “deeply saddened” by Powell’s death.  “He was a great public servant” and “widely respected at home and abroad,” Bush said. “And most important, Colin was a family man and a friend. Laura and I send Alma and their children our sincere condolences as they remember the life of a great man.”  Condoleezza Rice, Powell’s successor at State and the department’s first Black female secretary, praised him as “a trusted colleague and a dear friend through some very challenging times.”  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, a retired Army general and the first Black Pentagon chief, said the news of Powell’s death left “a hole in my heart.”  “The world lost one of the greatest leaders that we have ever witnessed,” Austin said while traveling in Europe.  Vice President Kamala Harris, the highest ranking Black woman in U.S. history, also noted Powell’s racial firsts.  “Every step of the way, when he filled those roles, he was by everything that he did and the way he did it, inspiring so many people,” she said. “Young servicemembers and others not only within the military, but in our nation and around the globe, took notice of what his accomplishments meant as a reflection of who we are as a nation.”  No child of privilege, Powell often framed his biography as an American success story.  “Mine is the story of a black kid of no early promise from an immigrant family of limited means who was raised in the South Bronx,” he wrote in his 1995 autobiography “My American Journey.”  It’s an experience he was fond of recalling later in his life. When he appeared at the United Nations, even during his Iraq speech, he often reminisced about his childhood in New York City, where he grew up the child of Jamaican immigrants and got one of his first jobs at the Pepsi-Cola bottling plant directly across the East River from the U.N. headquarters.  Powell’s path toward the military began at City College, where discovered the ROTC. When he put on his first uniform, he wrote, “I liked what I saw.”  He joined the Army and in 1962 he was one of more than 16,000 military advisers sent to South Vietnam by President John F. Kennedy. A series of promotions led to the Pentagon and assignment as a military assistant to Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, who became his unofficial sponsor. He later became commander of the Army’s 5th Corps in Germany and later was national security assistant to President Ronald Reagan.

,"DENVER—Colorado’s governor signed bills Wednesday that place new restrictions on firearms, signaling a change for Democrats who have traditionally shied away from gun control in a state with a pioneer tradition of gun ownership and self-reliance.  The legislation thrust Colorado into the national spotlight as a potential test of how far the country might be willing to go with new gun restrictions after the horror of mass killings at an Aurora movie theater and a Connecticut elementary school.  Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper signed bills that require background checks for private and online gun sales and ban ammunition magazines that hold more than 15 rounds.  The debate in the Democratic-controlled Legislature was intense, and Republicans warned that voters would make Democrats pay. The bills failed to garner a single Republican vote.  The bills’ approval came exactly eight months after dozens of people were shot in Aurora, and a day after the executive director of the state Corrections Department, Tom Clements, was shot and killed at his home. Hickenlooper signed the legislation right after speaking with reporters about Clements’ slaying.  Hickenlooper said large-capacity magazines “have the potential to turn killers into killing machines.” He also said he realized some gun owners may be inconvenienced but that “the potential for damage seems to outweigh, significantly, the inconvenience that people would have,” he said.  The bills signal a historic change for Democrats in a state where owning a gun is as common as owning a car in some rural areas.  “He just slapped rural Colorado right in the face,” said Republican Sen. Brophy, who represents an eastern plains district. “They are overwhelmingly upset about this.”  Both bills take effect July 1. People who currently own larger-capacity magazines will be able to keep them.  At the signing ceremony, Hickenlooper was surrounded by lawmakers who sponsored the bills, and relatives of mass shootings. Hickenlooper also signed requiring buyers to pay fees for background checks.  Each time he signed a bill, applause erupted from lawmakers and their guests, who included Jane Dougherty, whose sister was killed in the attack at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn.; Sandy Phillips, whose daughter was killed in Aurora; and Tom Mauser, whose son was killed in the 1999 Columbine shooting in Colorado.  Phillips, who lost daughter Jessica Ghawi, reminded Hickenlooper that it was the eight-month anniversary of the theater rampage.  “You’ve given us a real gift today,” she told the governor.  Later, Phillips added: “Thank you so much. You’re leading the entire country.”  Dougherty thanked Hickenlooper with tears in her eyes. Mauser also expressed gratitude.  “I knew it would be a long haul,” he said. “But I had faith in the people of Colorado.”  Democratic Rep. Rhonda Fields, who represents the district that includes the Aurora theater, said the governor had signed “common-sense legislation.”  “Gun violence is a problem nationwide, and sadly in the state of Colorado, we are all too familiar with some of these tragedies,” Fields.  Lawmakers debated firearms proposals after the Columbine High School shooting, and began requiring background checks for buyers at gun shows. But nothing they did then was as sweeping as the proposals they took up this year.  This year, Colorado lawmakers succeeded while members of their party stumbled in other states.  Washington state’s Democrat-controlled House failed this month to pass a universal background check bill. A bill requiring background checks at gun shows in New Mexico also stalled in that Democrat-led Legislature.  Republicans have warned that voters will punish Hickenlooper and other Democrats who voted in favor of the measures.  “The real solution here is at the ballot box in 2014,” Brophy said.  Republicans have said limiting magazine sizes will drive jobs from the state, and ultimately won’t prevent criminals from getting larger magazines in other states.  One Colorado-based manufacturer of ammunition magazines disclosed plans to relocate because of the new restrictions.  Police chiefs in urban areas supported the bills, but some rural county sheriffs opposed the new background checks, arguing the move is unenforceable and endangers Second Amendment rights.  Hickenlooper said law enforcement should try to find common ground.  “This shouldn’t be rural versus urban. We are one state,” he said.  ———  Associated Press writer Kristen Wyatt contributed to this report.  ———  Find Ivan Moreno on Twitter: http://twitter.com/IvanJourno",Colorado governor signs landmark gun bills,true,44552698923272633765331931773245091984
6.21E+08,"Where Will Austin Go For Water Next? By Terrence Henry Email  Tweet    REUTERS /JULIA ROBINSON /LANDOV  The Highland Lakes, the main reservoirs for over a million people in and around Austin, are only a third full. They could reach their lowest levels in history this summer.  As the shores of those lakes receded during the Texas drought, businesses dried up and water quality declined. If you take a trip out to Lake Travis today, you’ll notice the most popular shorebird is the vulture. With the lake 46 feet below where it should be, there’s plenty of shoreline for them.  If the main water supply of a million people is at risk, what’s the ‘Plan B?’  “Unfortunately, there is no ‘Plan B,'” says state Sen. Troy Fraser R-Horseshoe Bay. “We are totally dependent on Mother Nature in this area. It’s really a problem.”  But it’s a problem that finally seems to have gotten the attention of Austin’s city leaders.  Photo by Filipa Rodrigues/StateImpact Texas  The city’s main strategy to deal with the drought up until now has been conservation, and Austinites have answered the call. Per capita, the city is using less water than ever, according to Greg Meszaros, Director of Austin Water.  But rain continues to miss the lakes. Massive releases of water to rice farmers downstream that greatly reduced lake levels in 2011, the single driest year in Central Texas history, didn’t help either.  “Comparison-wise, about three years worth of Austin’s water use” was sent to rice farmers that year, Meszaros says.  Another silent straw is sucking up water from the lakes: evaporation.The lakes lose almost as much water to evaporation as the city uses every year. Now the city is starting to think about how to extend a shrinking supply.  Courtesy of CERES  Leading part of that effort is Sharlene Leurig, Director of the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Program at Ceres, a non-profit specializing in sustainability. Leurig is chairing a new water resource task force under the direction of Austin’s City Council. Their aim is to find solutions that could boost Austin’s water supply.  “There’s no single project that will solve the challenge before us,” Leurig says. But there are a number of projects and tweaks that could significantly improve the situation. Forget big reservoirs: Austin is looking to get creative in finding more water.  Some of the solutions, Leurig says, are sitting right under Austin’s nose. Standing on the shores of Lady Bird Lake in downtown Austin, surrounded by joggers and gazing out onto the dog park at Auditorium Shores, Leurig says the pass-through lake is more than just an aesthetic treat for Austinites.  Related Topics What Is The Lower Colorado River Authority?  “Use this as a storage supply,” she says. “That might actually accept treated wastewater produced by the city of Austin for reinjection back into our drinking water system.”  Once treated, Leurig says, the water would be purer than bottled water. Several other cities in Texas, including Wichita Falls, Brownwood and San Angelo are moving forward with or considering wastewater reuse programs.  It’s just one of the many smaller solutions on the Austin water supply smorgasbord, Meszaros of Austin Water says.  “For example, what’s called Walter E. Long Lake, or Decker Lake [in East Austin], there’s no technical reason you couldn’t use that lake as a complement to the water supply,” Meszaros says.  Other ideas on tap? Here are a few being considered by the water resource task force:  Fixing Longhorn dam to better control water flows.  Lowering Lake Austin to catch more rainfall.  Using aquifers underground to store water and prevent evaporation. Meszaros of Austin Water says the city would work to use land it could easily access in order to avoid potentially costly litigation.  Rainwater capture, distributed throughout the city, especially on commercial buildings downtown.  Using a biodegradable powder on the surface of lakes in Austin’s water supply to lower evaporation, starting with smaller lakes like Lady Bird Lake or Walter E. Long Lake.  Securing groundwater access from the Carrizo-Wilcox or Northern Edwards aquifers.  There’s no “silver bullet,” Meszaros says. “There’s no golden barrel of water out there that is vastly available and very low cost. If it were, people would have it already.”  Meszaros estimates that the right mix of projects could add roughly a quarter to nearly three-quarters of Austin’s annual water use from the Highland Lakes.  Leurig of the Water Resource Planning Task Force says the answer to strengthening Austin’s water supply is likely an “all of the above” strategy.  Such a hodge-podge of projects — even small ones — will take time and money. Some are costlier than others like aquifer storage and recovery, and how the city will prioritize and budget the projects remains to be seen. Austin Water is already preparing rate increases to make up for lost revenues during the drought.  Texas Tribune  “The unfortunate thing is, it doesn’t happen overnight,” says state Sen. Fraser.  “We’re about to go through a very hot, difficult summer that I’m very nervous about. Because this event we’re going through was preventable.”  The water resource task force has until June 20th to provide their recommendations to city council. What the council will decide to do then is an open question.  And the region’s water plan is undergoing changes that will likely result in far less water going to rice farmers during dry times. Meszaros of Austin Water says regardless, Austin will continue to rely on the Colorado system.  “The lakes aren’t going to run out of water in any immediate future,” he says. “But we’re gonna be in a potentially long-term situation where they’ll be at relatively low levels compared to their historic norms. Fundamentally, we’re going to be a Colorado River system water supply-driven community for many, many decades to come.”",Where Will Austin Go For Water Next?,true,

An ex-justice minister last night revealed how senior officers are having to spend time and money issuing the villains and drug lords with 'threat to life notices'. This is despite the fact they are putting themselves in peril through their own actions and it is diverting resources away from protecting 'innocent, law-abiding citizens'. The European Court of Human Rights has decided that not passing on intelligence that another gangster wants to hurt them infringes their right to life. The European Court of Human Rights has decided that not passing on intelligence that another gangster wants to hurt them infringes their right to life meaning police are having to tell them Dominic Raab, who left the Government in July, said the farce had been exposed to him by police as he gathered evidence for a British Bill of Rights He told House magazine: 'One of the things that happened because of Strasbourg – not the European Convention itself, but the judges – is they expanded through mission creep the scope of the Convention without any democratic accountability, to say that if police forces were aware of a risk to someone they must notify them. 'Now, that may be good policy. But turning it into a human right that can be enforced in court is crazy. 'One of the things I learnt as we started to gather evidence for the Bill of Rights, talking to Greater Manchester police, is that they now - as a result of that ruling - have to give tip-offs and notify gangsters who are fighting each other. And that absorbs a huge amount of their time. 'Now I'm not saying you should let gangsters fight it out, but I don't see why police resources – and this was the evidence we heard – should be displaced giving threat to life notices and tipping off gangsters who are engaged in gang warfare with each other, when I would like to see that taxpayer's money and police focus on dealing with and prioritising threats to innocent, law-abiding citizens.' He added: 'It's crazy that the unchecked expansion of human rights means precious police resources are squandered protecting gangsters from each other - rather than prioritised to protect law-abiding citizens.' The revelations will trigger new controversy over the failure by David Cameron's Government to scrap the Human Rights Act or take Britain out of the European Convention on Human Rights. David Cameron promised a decade ago to take firm action to end abuse of human rights law but the plans remained on the drawing board. Proposals by Mr Raab and former justice secretary Michael Gove were shelved as a result of the referendum. The new Justice Secretary, Liz Truss, is now reviewing the plans – with no date fixed for their publication. Prime Minister Theresa May has ruled out leaving the court altogether. She is in favour of full withdrawal but accepted that the plans would not be approved by Parliament. The ruling by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg pictured has forced police to warn gangsters that their lives might be in danger - at vast expense to taxpayers Earlier this month, Mrs Truss told MPs: 'There are changes that could be made but that is really a matter that we need to develop in the proposals that we will be putting forward in due course.' There have been at least 2,000 'threat to life' notices issued by 27 police forces who answered freedom of Information requests in the UK since 2012. The true figure will be far higher as the likes of West Midlands, Merseyside and Greater Manchester did not reply. The letters - also known as Osman warnings - are issued by police if they become aware of a 'real and immediate' threat to somebody's life, but there is not enough evidence to justify the police arresting the possible offender. They are named after Ali Osman, who was murdered by Paul Paget-Lewis, a teacher at his son's school, in 1988. Paget-Lewis formed a 'disturbing' attachment to Mr Osman's 14-year-old son Ahmet, then 14, and at one point told police he was considering committing a massacre. In March 1988, he stole a gun, killed Mr Osman and shot and seriously injured Ahmet. The Osman family successfully argued in the European Court of Human Rights that the Metropolitan Police had breached Mr Osman's right to life because it had all the information it needed to deal with the threat. The National Police Chiefs Council insists that Osman warnings have proved 'highly effective in the overwhelming majority of cases.'",Colorado Rockies Baseball Team To Sell Marijuana Brownies At Their Concession Stands,true,

bae4220d,"(CNN) Governments around the world must take ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"" to avoid disastrous levels of global warming , says a stark new report from the global scientific authority on climate change .  The report issued Monday by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), says the planet will reach the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by as early as 2030, precipitating the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people.  The date, which falls well within the lifetime of many people alive today, is based on current levels of greenhouse gas emissions.  The planet is already two-thirds of the way there, with global temperatures having warmed about 1 degree C . Avoiding going even higher will require significant action in the next few years.  ""This is concerning because we know there are so many more problems if we exceed 1.5 degrees C global warming, including more heatwaves and hot summers, greater sea level rise, and, for many parts of the world, worse droughts and rainfall extremes,"" Andrew King, a lecturer in climate science at the University of Melbourne, said in a statement.  Global net emissions of carbon dioxide would need to fall by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach ""net zero"" around 2050 in order to keep the warming around 1.5 degrees C.  Lowering emissions to this degree, while technically possible, would require widespread changes in energy, industry, buildings, transportation and cities, the report says.  ""The window on keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C is closing rapidly and the current emissions pledges made by signatories to the Paris Agreement do not add up to us achieving that goal,"" added King.  Sea ice is seen from NASA's Operation IceBridge research aircraft off the northwest coast of Greenland. Scientists say the Arctic has been one of the regions hardest hit by climate change.  Consequences of past inaction  The report makes it clear that climate change is already happening -- and what comes next could be even worse, unless urgent international political action is taken.  ""One of the key messages that comes out very strongly from this report is that we are already seeing the consequences of 1 degree C of global warming through more extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice, among other changes,"" said Panmao Zhai, co-chair of IPCC Working Group I.  Even if warming is kept at or just below 1.5 degrees C, the impacts will be widespread and significant.  Temperatures during summer heatwaves, such as those just experienced across Europe this summer, can be expected to increase by 3 degrees C says the report.  Coral reefs will also be drastically affected, with between 70 and 90% expected to die off, including Australia's Great Barrier Reef.  Countries in the southern hemisphere will be among the worse off, the report said, ""projected to experience the largest impacts on economic growth due to climate change should global warming increase.""  The report underlines how even the smallest increase in the base target would worsen the impact of recent natural disasters.  ""Every extra bit of warming matters, especially since warming of 1.5 degrees C or higher increases the risk associated with long-lasting or irreversible changes, such as the loss of some ecosystems,"" said Hans-Otto Pörtner, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group II.  The report cites specific examples of how impacts of global warming would be lessened with the 1.5 degrees C increase, compared to the 2 degrees C increase:  Global sea levels would rise 10 cm lower by 2100.  The likelihood of an Arctic Ocean free of sea ice in summer would be once per century, instead of at least once per decade.  Coral reefs would decline by 70% to 90% instead of being almost completely wiped out.  This chart from the IPCC shows how global temperatures would respond to a sudden and drastic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Even with immediate action, global temps will still overshoot the goal, but could reduce back to the target over time.  'Possible with the laws of chemistry and physics'  Monday's report is three years in the making and is a direct result of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement . In the Paris accord, 197 countries agreed to the goal of holding global temperatures ""well below"" 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees C.  The United States was initially in the agreement, but President Donald Trump pulled the country out a year and half later, claiming it was unfair to the country.  To limit global warming to 1.5 degree C is ""possible within the laws of chemistry and physics,"" said Jim Skea, co-chair of IPCC Working Group III. ""But doing so would require unprecedented changes.""  ""International cooperation is absolutely imperative to limit emissions and therefore global warming and its impacts, as well as coordinating effective and widespread adaptation and mitigation,"" said Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a fellow at the Climate Change Research Center at the University of New South Wales. ""The next few years will be critical in the evolution of these efforts.""  One key issue will be negative emissions, large scale carbon-scrubbing technologies that can reduce the amount in the atmosphere and act to counter continued pollution.  According to the report, there are two main ways of removing carbon from the atmosphere: increasing natural processes that already do this, and experimental carbon storage or removal technologies.  However, all methods ""are at different stages of development and some are more conceptual than others, as they have not been tested at scale,"" the report warned.  They will also require considerable political engagement globally, as will reducing the amount of carbon being emitted. Despite the report's dire warnings, there is no indication such cooperation will be doable, particularly given the Trump administration's stance on this issue.  ""Today the world's leading scientific experts collectively reinforced what mother nature has made clear -- that we need to undergo an urgent and rapid transformation to a global clean energy economy,"" former US Vice President Al Gore said.  ""Unfortunately, the Trump administration has become a rogue outlier in its shortsighted attempt to prop up the dirty fossil fuel industries of the past. The administration is in direct conflict with American businesses, states, cities and citizens leading the transformation.""","Planet has only until 2030 to stem catastrophic climate change, experts warn",true,

4501ba77,"First wave of free schools to be announced this Parliament - and pledge to deliver 2 waves of new schools every year until 2020 The 18 new schools announced today bring the total places created by free schools to 236,000 - making it the most successful new schools programme Prime Minister David Cameron vowed today 2 September 2015 he will ‘not waver’ in his commitment to open 500 new free schools over the next 5 years - as he announced the first wave to be approved this Parliament and pledged to deliver 2 waves of new schools every year until 2020. The government’s commitment to open 500 free schools over the next 5 years will create 270,000 school places across the country - giving parents more choice while challenging existing schools to up their game. Today, the first 18 projects of this Parliament have had the green light - creating more than 9,000 places across the country and giving more families the choice of an excellent education for their children than ever before. They will join the 252 already open and the 52 new free schools opening up their doors as schools head back this week. These will bring the total number of free school places created since 2010 to more than 236,000 - making this policy the most successful new schools programme, with schools being created more quickly than ever before. 500 more free schools The government has committed to opening 500 more free schools in this Parliament, creating good school places in communities across the country. To achieve this, 2 waves of schools will be announced every year up to 2020, with application deadlines in March and September. The latest application window to set up a free school opens on 28 September and runs until 7 October, with pre-application registration opening today. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan today called on more groups to step forward, invest in the next generation and reap the rewards that opening a free school can bring. To help them do that she has committed to streamlining the process for existing high performing schools and encouraging businesses, charities, cultural and sporting bodies to enter the programme. Find out more about how to set up a free school. Prime Minister David Cameron said: As a ‘one nation’ government we are clear that every family should have access to a great local school and every child should get the very best education - and free schools are a crucial part of that aim. The aim of this policy is crystal clear - to increase the number of good and outstanding school places so that more parents have the security of knowing their child is getting a great education. Today’s announcement shows that we will not waver in pressing ahead with our plans to open 500 more of these innovative and exciting schools over the next 5 years, creating 270,000 places, delivering an excellent education and giving parents across the country real choice for their children. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said: The free schools programme has sent out the message loud and clear, that parents should never have to settle for anything less than the best for their child. Right across the country, these innovative, community led schools are helping to fulfil our ‘one nation’ commitment to educational excellence for every child. We know that free schools don’t just give parents greater choice, they also force existing schools to up their game. Today’s news sends a clear message that we are committed to extending this unprecedented level of choice to more parents than ever before. The 18 new schools announced today include a number that will be set up by teachers themselves, showing the programme is putting power back in the hands of those who know children best. These include Solihull Alternative Provision Academy, set up by 3 headteachers of high-performing schools in Solihull, West Midlands, which will help transform the lives of local children who have fallen out of mainstream schooling. Other innovative schools due to be created include: XP East, a new secondary school for 350 children in Doncaster. XP East will have a deliberately-small campus feel, like its heavily-oversubscribed sister school, the XP School, and is influenced by a number of charter schools in America Gipsy Hill Secondary School, which will provide a classical and aspirational education for up to 1,600 children in South London. Opening in 2017, the school will educate children based around the classical ‘trivium’ - a system of thinking developed as far back as Ancient Greece that sees logic, grammar and rhetoric as the foundations of learning CAPA College, a specialist performing arts college in Leeds through which pupils can look forward to the opportunity to perform in world class venues, such as the Royal Albert Hall Piper Hill Vocational Learning Free School, a special school in Wythenshawe, Cheshire, which will help children with severe learning difficulties and autism spectrum disorder to improve their independence and employability skills through a range of courses that include horticulture and animal welfare Free schools Free schools are brand new schools set up by parents, teachers, charities, academy sponsors and existing schools in response to demand from the local community, either where there is a shortage of places, or where the parents are not happy with the places on offer. The new schools announced today, on top of the 252 already opened, and the 98 in the pipeline, will meet the growing demand of parents for more excellent local schools with high standards and strong discipline. 74% of open free schools are located in areas where there was a need for more school places and around half are in the 30% most deprived communities in the country. They are also more likely to be rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted than other schools - and research has shown they are helping to raise standards in neighbouring schools by introducing fresh ideas and competition. The free schools programme is also transforming the lives of many of society’s most disadvantaged and disaffected children. 17% of all free schools are dedicated to special needs or alternative provision, giving more help to those most in need. Policy Exchange research shows that as well as providing an excellent education to their own pupils, they are also associated with improvements in local poorly-performing schools. And more than two-thirds of free school heads say they are having a positive impact on schools in their local area - driving up standards and ensuring more parents have a great school in their neighbourhood. Building on the success of the programme, the government is now allowing free school applicants to apply for nurseries as part of their bid. This is all part of meeting the government’s pledge to provide flexible, high-quality childcare that allows parents to return to work. Today’s approved free schools Rugby Free Secondary School, Rugby, Warwickshire Rugby Free Secondary School will be opening in the town in September 2016. It is being set up by the trust behind Rugby Free Primary School, which opens in September 2015. The new, mixed, secondary will provide 1,260 much-needed school places for 11- to 19-year-olds. It will be a comprehensive school with an academic curriculum that will specialise in a combination of STEM science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects and music. John Donne Primary Free School, Peckham, London Proposed by the heavily over-subscribed John Donne Primary School JDPS , judged to be ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted in October 2011, JDPS in Peckham will offer the same excellent education that is on offer at the parent school. JDPS already serves a vibrant and diverse community, meeting the aspirations of parents. Opening in 2017, this school will build on the continuing success of JDPS and will provide additional school places for almost 500 children, including a 60 place nursery. Catch22 Northamptonshire Academy, Northampton The Catch22 Northamptonshire Academy will be a new alternative provision school for 4- to 16-year-olds in Northampton. Opening in 2016, the new school will provide 100 much needed places for children who are struggling in a mainstream setting. The school will be led by Catch22 Multi-Academy Trust, an established provider of alternative provision that already runs four schools in Oxfordshire, Suffolk, Buckinghamshire and Bristol. All these schools have been judged to be good by Ofsted within the last 2 years. The new school will offer personalised pathways to its pupils to help reintegrate them back in to mainstream provision. The school is supported by Northamptonshire county council, which sees it as a valuable contribution to alternative provision in the area. Corby Free Special School, Corby, Northamptonshire The Maplefields Teaching School Alliance is a leading special needs provider with all of its 5 member schools judged to be ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted. The Corby Free Special School will address the need for more special school places in Corby, where parents and their children often have to travel significant distances to access a suitable education. This bespoke school for up to 100 local pupils, provided by highly experienced and incredibly passionate educationalists, will help to transform the lives of many children and their families in north Northamptonshire. The Swan School, Oxford To meet the increasing need for secondary school places as Oxford’s population grows, Cherwell School, judged to be ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted in January 2008, will be opening The Swan School, a secondary school in 2017. The school will offer access to the highest quality education and aim to raise levels of attainment beyond that achieved by other schools in the city. As a national teaching school, Cherwell School already supports the training and development of excellent teachers within Oxford and further afield. Supported by Oxford city council, this new free school will provide 880 pupils with a strong academic curriculum in a supportive and challenging environment. Piper Hill Vocational Learning Free School, Wythenshawe, Cheshire The Piper Hill Learning Trust, sponsor of Piper Hill High School, judged to be ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted in March 2013, will be opening a unique vocational special free school in 2016. The Piper Hill Vocational Learning Free School will provide 25 much needed places for 11- to 19-year-olds with severe learning difficulties and autism spectrum disorder. The school’s focus will be on developing personal independence, employability skills and preparing these young people for the world of work. Hospitality, catering, horticulture, and animal welfare will provide real life work experience for pupils. The school, in Wythenshawe, will primarily serve the central and south Manchester areas. Bury St Edmunds Technical Academy, Suffolk Bury St Edmunds Technical Academy will open its doors in 2017. It will be led by the Bury St Edmunds All-Through Trust, which runs Bury St Edmunds County Upper School, judged to be ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted in September 2013. The new school will focus on science and engineering and pupils can look forward to work placements and work based projects through the trust’s partnerships with a range of local employers. Saint Anne’s High School for Girls, Luton, Bedfordshire Proposed by a group of local teachers, Saint Anne’s High School for Girls will be a secondary school for Luton that will provide a calm, caring and nurturing environment where hard work and exemplary behaviour are the norm. Opening in 2017, the school’s focus on science, technology, engineering and mathematics STEM will empower students with the knowledge and skills to become informed citizens in an increasingly scientific and technological society. In an area where the majority of pupils come from ethnic minority backgrounds, the school will provide 750 students with the opportunity to excel academically, and gain skills and experiences needed to make informed choices about their future. XP East, Doncaster, south Yorkshire The XP Schools Trust will open their second secondary school, XP East, in September 2017. The new 350 place school will be located next to the existing XP School in Doncaster in a deliberate move to create a small campus feel for both schools. The XP schools are based on an innovative approach to learning developed in certain charter schools in America in which subjects are taught through project-based learning. The XP School opened in 2014 and is proving so popular that there are 2 applications for each place. XP East will bring greater choice for parents and help to raise standards in Doncaster. Solihull Alternative Provision Academy, Solihull, West Midlands In response to a clear need for places, a group of headteachers in Solihull, whose 3 schools have all been judged to be ‘good’ by Ofsted, have united to establish the Solihull Alternative Provision Academy. This new school will open in 2017 with places for 90 pupils. The school will cater for pupils who are currently disengaged from education, and are struggling to achieve in a traditional secondary school setting. The school will provide individualised support for pupils in a smaller school environment. Whilst the school will focus on academic rigour it will also provide the opportunity to follow a more vocational route. The school will be accessible to children across the whole of Solihull and beyond, but its key focus will be to serve the children attending schools located in the south of the borough. Lime Tree High School, Reigate, Surrey Opening in 2017, Lime Tree High School will provide 900 high-quality places in Reigate. The trust’s existing local school, the Lime Tree Primary, judged to be ‘good’ by Ofsted in May 2015, is already a popular choice with parents. The secondary expertise behind this free school will comes from the Glyn School, judged to be ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted in May 2012, where pupils achieve results that have consistently exceeded the national and local averages. This exciting new option for local parents will make a valuable contribution to the diversity of local provision and the raising of pupils’ attainment and ambitions in Reigate. CAPA College, Leeds, Yorkshire CAPA College, which will open its doors in 2017, will be a specialist performing arts college based in Leeds. It will be led by the Wakefield Diocesan Academies Trust behind CAPA sixth form in Wakefield, judged to be outstanding by Ofsted. The new college will provide young people throughout Yorkshire with an exciting and diverse curriculum, and pupils can look forward to working with a range of organisations across the arts industry to help prepare them for their future careers. Pupils will also have the opportunity to perform in world class venues, such as the Royal Albert Hall. Gipsy Hill Secondary School, South London In response to the wishes of local parents, the Gipsy Hill Secondary School in Lambeth will provide a classical and aspirational education. Run by the Gipsy Hill Federation, which already operates five successful primary schools in the area, all judged to be ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted, this secondary school will ensure a seamless education for over 1600 students. Opening in 2017, the school will deliver a wide ranging curriculum, with strong pastoral support and a relentless focus on performance and success to meet the existing and growing needs of its community. MacIntyre Special Free School, Rugby, Warwickshire MacIntyre Special Free School will open in Rugby in September 2017. It will be a special school providing 80 places for children and young people between the ages of 9 and 19 with behavioural, emotional and social difficulties and conditions on the autistic spectrum, with support tailored to the needs of the individual children. The group behind the school, MacIntyre Academies Trust, runs 2 other academies, Endeavour Academy in Oxford and the newly-opened Discovery Academy in Nuneaton. The Bridge AP Free School, Medway, Kent With the strong support of the local authority, the Bridge AP Free School will provide a dynamic personalised curriculum for 5- to 11-year-olds with behavioural, emotional and social difficulties in Medway. Set on the Delce Academy campus, judged to be ‘good’ by Ofsted in July 2010, in the heart of Medway, the new school will open in 2017 as an evolution of the existing pilot to provide primary education for 40 children who find it difficult to cope with mainstream schools. The Bridge will secure progress and success for each of its learners to ensure that each child is prepared for the next stage of their education when they return to mainstream education. Norton Hill Primary School, Midsomer Norton, Somerset Norton Hill Primary School will provide 420 places for 4- to 11-year-olds in Midsomer Norton, opening in 2017. The school will be led by the Midsomer Norton Schools Partnership, an established provider of primary and secondary academies, which already runs four schools in Bath, Bristol and Cheshire. All these schools have been judged to be ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted within the last 2 years. The school will aim to develop key skills in science, technology, engineering and maths. Herts International Christian School, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire Herts International Christian School will open its doors for up to 630 pupils aged 4- to 11 in Welwyn Garden City in 2017. Specialising in Spanish from as early as the primary phase, the school will bring greater choice for local parents. Pupils can look forward to a diverse enrichment programme, from traditional chess and drama, through to more contemporary street dance.

,"11. Strengths and limitations  Pre-release data  HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) grants pre-release access to official statistics publications. As this is a joint release, and in accordance with the HMRC policy, pre-release access has been granted to a number of people to enable the preparation of statistical publications and ministerial briefing. Further details, including a list of those granted access, can be found on HMRC’s website.  The Bank of England was granted exceptional pre-release access to this bulletin and accompanying tables at 1:00pm on Friday 11 March 2022 so that the data were available for the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting held on that day. See exchange of letters requesting exceptional pre-release access so that data are available for discussion at the MPC.  Experimental Statistics status  This is a joint experimental release between HMRC and the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The existing monthly publications produced by the ONS remain the primary National Statistics for the labour market. The intention is that these new statistics will also be updated on a monthly basis.  The release is classed as Experimental Statistics as the methodologies used to produce the statistics are still in their development phase. This does not mean that the statistics are of low quality, but it does signify that the statistics are new and still being developed. As the methodologies are refined and improved, there may be revisions to these statistics.  Rather than waiting until the development work has been completed, the statistics are being published now to involve potential users in developing the statistics. We hope that this encourages users to provide us with their thoughts and suggestions on how useful the statistics are and what can be done to improve them. You can send us your comments by email.  More information about Experimental Statistics, including when they should be used and the differences between them and National Statistics, is available.  Strengths of the data  As Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Real Time Information (RTI) data cover the whole population, rather than a sample of people or companies, we are able to use these to produce estimates for geographic areas and other more detailed breakdowns of the population. The methods for producing such breakdowns are under development and we expect to include further statistics in a future release. These statistics can help inform decision-making across the country. They also have the potential to provide more timely estimates than existing measures.  These statistics also have the potential to replace some of those based on surveys, which could reduce the burden on businesses needing to fill in statistical surveys.  Imputation and revisions  A limitation of the calendarisation used is that the figures for pay and numbers of employees in month t depend on payments made in month t plus 1. This means only around 80% of the data used in the calculation on month t statistics are available at the end of each month.  Rather than wait until all those remaining payment returns have been received, we have decided to produce a timelier measure of numbers of employees and median pay by imputing the values for missing returns. The data on which the statistics are based were extracted at the beginning of March 2022, which means around 1% to 2% of the data for January 2022 are imputed, while around 15% of the data for the “flash” February 2022 data are imputed. As a result, the figures in future releases will be updated as new payment returns are received, and the imputation payments can be replaced with actual data.  Starting with the December 2020 publication, we introduced a revisions policy. For each publication, we incorporate new input data only for the latest two tax years. In May of each year, new input data will be incorporated for the whole data time series. The benefit of introducing this revisions policy is that we can use the processing time saved to produce and publish more detailed breakdowns.  Seasonal adjustment  The seasonal adjustment applied in this bulletin follows established best practice. This approach assumes that any seasonal patterns remain broadly consistent over time. If the seasonal pattern changes in strength, this will be represented as greater volatility in the seasonally adjusted figures. Both the seasonal and non-seasonally adjusted data sets are released alongside this bulletin.  Differences compared with the Labour Force Survey and Average Weekly Earnings statistics  Further information about the methodology used and comparisons with the ONS’s Labour Force Survey (LFS) and Average Weekly Earnings can be found in New methods for monthly earnings and employment estimates from Pay As You Earn Real Time Information (PAYE RTI) data: December 2019.

,"Updated at 3:00 p.m. ET on August 23, 2021  Robert Malone—a medical doctor and an infectious-disease researcher—recently suggested that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines might actually make COVID-19 infections worse. He chuckled as he imagined Anthony Fauci announcing that the vaccination campaign was all a big mistake (“Oh darn, I was wrong!”) and would need to be abandoned. When he floated that nightmare scenario during a recent podcast interview with Steve Bannon, both men seemed almost delighted at the prospect of public-health officials and pharmaceutical companies getting their comeuppance. “This is a catastrophe,” Bannon declared, beaming at his guest. “You’re hearing it from an individual who invented the mRNA [vaccine] and has dedicated his life to vaccines. He’s the opposite of an anti-vaxxer.”  Before going any further, let’s be clear that the back-and-forth between Bannon and Malone was premised on misinformation. The vaccines have repeatedly been shown to help prevent symptomatic coronavirus infections and reduce their severity. Malone was riffing on a botched sentence in a USA Today article, one that was later deleted but not before being screenshotted and widely shared. That kind of overheated, spottily sourced conversation is par for the course on shows like Bannon’s, which traffic in a set of claims that sound depressingly familiar: The vaccines cause more harm than experts are letting on; Fauci is a liar and possibly a fascist; and the mainstream news media is either shamelessly complicit or too stupid to figure out what’s really going on.  In that alternate media universe, Robert Malone’s star is ascendant. He started popping up on podcasts and cable news shows a few months ago, presented as a scientific expert, arguing that the approval process for the vaccines had been unwisely rushed. He told Tucker Carlson that the public doesn’t have enough information to decide whether to get vaccinated. He told Glenn Beck that offering incentives for taking vaccines is unethical. He told Del Bigtree, an anti-vaccine activist who opposes common childhood inoculations, that there hadn’t been sufficient research on how the vaccines might affect women’s reproductive systems. On show after show, Malone, who has quickly amassed more than 200,000 Twitter followers, casts doubt on the safety of the vaccines while decrying what he sees as attempts to censor dissent.  Read: How mRNA technology could change the world  Wherever he appears, Malone is billed as the inventor of mRNA vaccines. It’s in his Twitter bio. “I literally invented mRNA technology when I was 28,” says Malone, who is now 61. If that’s true—or, more to the point, if Malone believes it to be true—then you might expect him to be championing a very different message in his media appearances. According to one recent study, the innovation for which he claims to be responsible has already saved hundreds of thousands of lives in the United States alone; there’s talk that it may soon lead to a round of Nobel Prizes. It’s the kind of validation that few scientists in history have ever received. Yet instead of taking a victory lap, Malone has emerged as one of the most vocal critics of his own alleged accomplishment. He’s sowed doubt about the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines on pretty much any podcast or YouTube channel that will have him.  Why is the self-described inventor of the mRNA vaccines working so hard to undermine them?  Whether Malone really came up with mRNA vaccines is a question probably best left to Swedish prize committees, but you could make a case for his involvement. When I called Malone at his 50-acre horse farm in Virginia, he directed me to a 6,000-word essay written by his wife, Jill, that lays out why he believes himself to be the primary discoverer. “This is a story about academic and commercial avarice,” it begins. The document’s tone is pointed, and at times lapses into all-caps fury. She frames her husband as a genius scientist who is “largely unknown by the scientific establishment because of abuses by individuals to secure their own place in the history books.”  The abridged version is that when Malone was a graduate student in biology in the late 1980s at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, he injected genetic material—DNA and RNA—into the cells of mice in hopes of creating a new kind of vaccine. He was the first author on a 1989 paper demonstrating how RNA could be delivered into cells using lipids, which are basically tiny globules of fat, and a co-author on a 1990 Science paper showing that if you inject pure RNA or DNA into mouse muscle cells, it can lead to the transcription of new proteins. If the same approach worked for human cells, the latter paper said in its conclusion, this technology “may provide alternative approaches to vaccine development.”  These two studies do indeed represent seminal work in the field of gene transfer, according to Rein Verbeke, a postdoctoral fellow at Ghent University, in Belgium, and the lead author of a 2019 history of mRNA-vaccine development. (Indeed, Malone’s studies are the first two references in Verbeke’s paper, out of 224 in total.) Verbeke told me he believes that Malone and his co-authors “sparked for the first time the hope that mRNA could have potential as a new drug class,” though he also notes that “the achievement of the mRNA vaccines of today is the accomplishment of a lot of collaborative efforts.”  Read: The pandemic’s wrongest man  Malone says he deserves credit for more than just sparking hope. He dropped out of graduate school in 1988, just short of his Ph.D., and went to work at a pharmaceutical company called Vical. Now he claims that both the Salk Institute and Vical profited from his work and essentially prevented him from further pursuing his research. (A Salk Institute spokesperson said that nothing in the institute’s records substantiates Malone’s allegations. The biotech company into which Vical was merged, Brickell, did not respond to requests for comment.) To say that Malone remains bitter over this perceived mistreatment doesn’t do justice to his sense of aggrievement. He calls what happened to him “intellectual rape.”  One target of Malone’s ire, the biochemist Katalin Karikó, has been featured in multiple news stories as an mRNA-vaccine pioneer. CNN called her work “the basis of the Covid-19 vaccine” while a New York Times headline said she had “helped shield the world from the coronavirus.” None of those stories mentioned Malone. “I’ve been written out of the history,” he has said. “It’s all about Kati.” Karikó shared with me an email that Malone sent her in June, accusing her of feeding reporters bogus information and inflating her own accomplishments. “This is not going to end well,” Malone’s message says.  Karikó replied that she hadn’t told anyone that she is the inventor of mRNA vaccines and that “many many scientists” contributed to their success. “I have never claimed more than discovering a way to make RNA less inflammatory,” she wrote to him. She told me that Malone referred to himself in an email as her “mentor” and “coach,” though she says they’ve met in person only once, in 1997, when he invited her to give a talk. It’s Malone, according to Karikó, who has been overstating his accomplishments. There are “hundreds of scientists who contributed more to mRNA vaccines than he did.”  Malone insists that his warning to Karikó that “this is not going to end well” was not intended as a threat. Instead, he says, he was suggesting that her exaggerations would soon be exposed. Malone views Karikó as yet another scientist standing on his shoulders and collecting plaudits that should go to him. Others have been rewarded handsomely for their work on mRNA vaccines, he says. (Karikó is a senior vice president at BioNTech, which partnered with Pfizer to create the first COVID-19 vaccine to be authorized for use last year.) Malone is not exactly living on the streets: In addition to being a medical doctor, he has served as a vaccine consultant for pharmaceutical companies.  In any case, it’s clear enough that Malone isn’t singularly responsible for mRNA vaccines. The process of achieving major scientific advancements tends to be more cumulative and complex than the apple-to-the-head stories we usually tell, but this much can be said for sure: Malone was involved in groundbreaking work related to mRNA vaccines before it was cool or profitable; and he and others who believed in the potential of RNA-based vaccines in the 1980s turned out to be world-savingly correct.  Malone may keep company with vaccine skeptics, but he insists he is not one himself. His objections to the Pfizer and Moderna shots have to do mostly with their expedited approval process and with the government’s system for tracking adverse reactions. Speaking as a doctor, he would probably recommend their use only for those at highest risk from COVID-19. Everyone else should be wary, he told me, and those under 18 should be excluded entirely. (A June 23 statement from more than a dozen public-health organizations and agencies strongly encouraged all eligible people 12 and older to get vaccinated, because the benefits “far outweigh any harm.”) Malone is also frustrated that, as he sees it, complaints about side effects are being ignored or censored in the nationwide push to increase vaccination rates.  You might very well walk away with the skewed sense, after hearing Malone speak or reading his posts, that there is a far-reaching COVID-19 cover-up and that the real threat is the vaccine rather than the virus. I’ve listened to hours of Malone’s interviews and read through the many pages of documents he’s posted. He is a knowledgeable scientist with a knack for lucid explanation. It doesn’t hurt that he looks the part with his neatly trimmed white beard, or that he has a voice that would be well suited for a meditation app. Malone is not a subscriber to the more out-there conspiracy theories regarding COVID-19 vaccines—he doesn’t, for instance, think Bill Gates has snuck microchips into syringes—and he sometimes pushes back gently when hosts like Bigtree or Beck drift into more ludicrous territory.  And yet he does routinely slip into speculation that turns out to be misleading or, as in the segment on Bannon’s show, plainly false. For instance, he recently tweeted that, according to an unnamed “Israeli scientist,” Pfizer and the Israeli government have an agreement not to release information about adverse effects for 10 years, which is hard to believe given that the country’s health ministry has already warned of a link between the Pfizer shot and rare cases of myocarditis. Malone’s LinkedIn account has twice been suspended for supposedly spreading misinformation.  Read: The mRNA vaccines are extraordinary, but Novavax is even better  His concerns are personal, too. Malone contracted COVID-19 in February 2020, and later got the Moderna vaccine in hopes that it would alleviate his long-haul symptoms. Now he believes the injections made his symptoms worse: He still has a cough and is dealing with hypertension and reduced stamina, among other maladies. “My body will never be the same,” he told me. In media appearances, he often notes that he has colleagues in the government and at universities who agree with him and are privately cheering him on. I spoke with several of these people—vaccine scientists and biotech consultants, suggested by Malone himself— and that is not what they told me. The portrait they paint of Malone is of an insightful researcher who can be headstrong. They related accounts of him, pre-pandemic, getting booted from projects because he was hard to communicate with and unwilling to compromise. (Malone has acknowledged his penchant for butting heads with fellow scientists.) And they are taken aback by his emergence as a vaccine skeptic. One called his eagerness to appear on less-than-reputable podcasts “naive,” while another said he thought Malone’s public rhetoric had “migrated from extrapolated assertions to sensational assertions.” Stan Gromkowski, a cellular immunologist who did work on mRNA vaccines in the early 1990s and views Malone as an underappreciated pioneer, put it this way: “He’s fucking up his chances for a Nobel Prize.”  It’s only in the curious world of fringe media that Malone has found the platform, and the recognition, he’s sought for so long. He talks to hosts who aren’t going to question whether he’s the brains behind the Pfizer and Moderna shots. They’re not going to quibble over whether credit should be shared with co-authors, or talk about how science is like a relay race, or point out that, absent the hard work of brilliant researchers who came before and after Malone, there would be no vaccine. He’s an upgrade over their typical guest list of chiropractors and naturopaths, and they’re perfectly happy to address him by the title he believes he’s earned: inventor of the mRNA vaccines.  The irony is that, to the audiences who tune in to those shows, the vaccines are seen as a scourge rather than a godsend. No matter how nuanced Malone might try to be, or how many qualifiers he appends to his opinions, he is egging on vaccine hesitancy at a time when hospitals in the least-vaccinated parts of the country are struggling to cope with an influx of new COVID-19 patients. If you want proof of that, scroll through the many comments from his followers thanking him for confirming their fears. Malone has finally made his mark, by undermining confidence in the very vaccine he says wouldn’t be possible without his genius. It’s a victory, of sorts, but one that he and the rest of us may come to regret.",The Vaccine Scientist Spreading Vaccine Misinformation,true,113257422404404448187697421125243685611
2aac10a5,"After three decades on the bench, Sarah Parker soon will find herself in an unfamiliar role: No cases to hear, no opinions to write, no court system to run.
This week Parker, chief justice of North Carolina’s Supreme Court for eight years, steps down after reaching the mandatory retirement age of 72 Saturday.
“There may be something to be said for statutory senility,” she says. A former Charlotte lawyer, Parker will leave with a reputation as a respected if unassuming jurist who guided the court through choppy waters with a steady hand and even temperament.
“Sarah is a quintessential professional,” says Republican Bob Orr, a former associate justice. “She has a sense of the history and tradition of the court as well as the system. She’s been a good chief justice in difficult times.” Gov. Pat McCrory named Associate Justice Mark Martin, 51, to succeed her. Martin is running against Ola Mae Lewis, a Superior Court judge from Brunswick County. Both are Republicans, though the November race is nonpartisan.
Parker, a Democrat, is stepping down after 21 years on the high court, where she heard 2,397 cases and wrote 153 opinions. In many ways it was a pioneering career.
She was one of a handful of women in law school. When she joined a Charlotte firm in 1969, she was the first woman in its century-old history. And for much of her judicial tenure, she was the only woman on either the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court.
The winner of November’s contest will inherit what Parker leaves behind: a court system hit hard by budget cuts and one increasingly buffeted by partisan politics.
Budget cuts strain operations The General Assembly’s final budget included $3.5 million in cuts to state courts, which the chief justice oversees. This hits a system that already has lost over 600 positions.
“This level of cut places a real strain on court operations and will require some difficult decisions to achieve,” Parker says. “We’re down really to bare bones.”
Budget pressures were a big part of Parker’s speech this summer to the North Carolina Bar Association in Wilmington. But Parker also spoke about a different kind of pressure.
Her speech came weeks after a group called Justice For All NC, funded by the Republican State Leadership Committee, spent $899,000 on TV ads against Justice Robin Hudson who, like all judges, runs in nonpartisan races.
In 2012, outside groups spent $2.3 million to re-elect incumbent Justice Paul Newby, far more than the $300,000 in outside money behind his opponent, Sam Ervin IV. “(I)f people perceive that our courts are for sale, they will lose confidence in the ability of courts to be fair and impartial,” she told the bar. “…We must have judges committed to the rule of law … without regard to politics, special interests or personal agenda.”
Former Chief Justice James Exum called it “one of her finest hours.” “She was keen to call the attention of lawyers to the ever-increasing politicization of our judiciary,” he says, “and how concerned she was and they should be.”
Parker says public financing for nonpartisan judicial races helped relieve the pressure of reliance on outside money. Last year the General Assembly ended public financing.
“The danger is people will begin to believe that seats on the high court are for sale to the highest bidder,” says Bob Hall, director of Democracy North Carolina and advocate of public financing. “And, unfortunately, some wealthy special interests seem happy to see that happen.” From Garinger to high court Orr once called Parker “one of the more conservative justices that has been on the court in a good long while.” But she has generally avoided partisan politics.

After two years at Raleigh’s Meredith College, she transferred to UNC Chapel Hill, a school women generally could not attend until their junior year.
After graduation she joined the Peace Corps and spent two years teaching English in Ankara, Turkey. It was there she firmed up her decision to go into law. She returned to Chapel Hill for law school. Gov. Jim Hunt appointed her to the Court of Appeals in 1984. She was first elected to the Supreme Court in 1992 (“the first Garinger graduate to become a member of the Supreme Court,” she once joked).

,"A pause on all US vaccinations with the Johnson & Johnson Covid shot will continue for at least another week after members of a government-convened expert panel said Wednesday they needed more time to assess its possible links to a clotting disorder.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) convened a meeting a day after authorities reported six cases of women developing brain clots along with low blood platelet counts, including one death, within two weeks of people getting the one-dose Covid-19 vaccine.  The shot has been given to some 7.2 million Americans, and participants at the meeting were told on Wednesday a seventh case involving a 28-year-old woman has been identified.  Wednesday's meeting could have decided whether to limit the vaccine to some subsets of the population, but most members said they were not yet comfortable in making that call without more data to study.  ""I don't want to send the message that there is something fundamentally wrong with this vaccine,"" said Beth Bell, chair of the working group.  ""But I want to be able to understand and defend the decision that I've made based on a reasonable amount of data,"" she added.  The next meeting has not yet been set but is expected in another week to ten days.  Some experts were against continuing the pause, fearing it might disproportionately impact vulnerable groups that are easier to reach through a single-dose vaccine that can be stored in fridges.  But most felt that given the highly serious nature of the clots, which can have devastating neurological consequences even when they do not kill, and given the abundance in the United States of other vaccines that do not have the same safety concern, further study was necessary.  The presentations revealed that of the first six cases identified, all were white females, none had previously known clotting disorders, and one was using estrogen/progesterone, taken to mean oral contraceptive.  Story continues  The woman who died was 45, and three of the women also had clots outside the brain.  Though the link to the vaccine has yet to be conclusively determined, scientists are now treating the shot as the ""probable cause"" of the disorder, which has been dubbed ""vaccine induced immune thrombocytopenia"" or ""VIIT.""  Ahead of the meeting, CDC director Rochelle Walensky said the symptoms are consistent with rare side effects from the AstraZeneca vaccine seen in Europe.  Both the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines are based on adenovirus vector technology, which is now under scrutiny.  Other Covid adenovirus vector vaccines include Russia's Sputnik V and China's CanSino.  People who received the J&J vaccine are being urged to report if they experience symptoms including severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain or shortness of breath.  Doctors meanwhile have been told not to treat such clots with the common thinner heparin.  Four of the initial six cases were treated using heparin, and this might have made their condition worse, according to the leading biological hypothesis for what is driving the effect.  Cases involving clots together with low platelets have not been linked to the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, which are based on messenger RNA technology.  When the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices reconvenes, it could potentially vote to recommend that only people beyond a certain age receive the J&J vaccine.  The reasoning is that the older people get, the more they risk developing a serious form of Covid, and the more it is in their interest to be vaccinated despite potential side effects.  But US officials have also emphasized that they have more than enough supply lined up of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines to cover the adult population by the end of July, which could make giving the J&J shot the green light again unnecessary.  ia/dw",US J&J Covid vaccine pause continues after experts defer vote,true,218910857940164763782025329110698806335

,"The UK will block visas for visitors from countries the home secretary believes are refusing to cooperate in taking back rejected asylum seekers or offenders.  In proposed legislation published on Tuesday, Priti Patel and future home secretaries would have the power to suspend or delay the processing of applications from countries that do no “cooperate with the UK government in relation to the removal from the United Kingdom of nationals of that country who require leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom but do not have it”.  The clause in the nationality and borders bill also allows for the home secretary to impose additional financial requirements for visa applications – that is, an increase in fees – if countries do not cooperate.  The proposals mirror US legislation that allows officials to withdraw visa routes from countries that refuse to take back undocumented migrants. It is understood that countries such as Iraq, Iran, Eritrea and Sudan are reluctant to cooperate with the UK on such matters.  The change is one of many in the bill, described as “the biggest overhaul of the UK’s asylum system in decades” by Patel, which includes measures such as:  Asylum seekers deemed to have arrived in the UK illegally will no longer have the same entitlements as those who arrive in the country via legal routes. Even if their claim is successful, they will be granted temporary refugee status and face the prospect of being indefinitely liable for removal.  Asylum seekers will be able to be removed from the UK while their asylum claim or appeal is pending, which opens the door to offshore asylum processing.  For those deemed to have arrived illegally, access to benefits and family reunion rights could be limited.  The appeals and judicial process will be changed to speed up the removal of those whose claims are refused.  The home secretary will be able to offer protection to vulnerable people in “immediate danger and at risk in their home country” in exceptional circumstances. It is thought this will be used to help a small number of people.  The system will be made “much harder for people to be granted refugee status based on unsubstantiated claims” and will include “rigorous age assessments” to stop adults pretending to be children. The government is considering the use of bone scanners to determine age.  Life sentences will be brought in as a maximum penalty for people-smugglers.  Foreign criminals who breach deportation orders and return to the UK could be jailed for up to five years instead of the current six months.  A new one-stop legal process is proposed so that asylum, human rights claims and any other protection matters are made and considered together before appeal hearings.  Campaigners have dubbed the proposed legislation the “anti-refugee bill”, claiming it will penalise those who need help the most.  Analysis of Home Office data by the Refugee Council suggests 9,000 people who would be accepted as refugees under current rules – those confirmed to have fled war or persecution following official checks – may no longer be given safety in the UK due to their means of arrival under the changes.  The charity’s chief executive, Enver Solomon, said that for decades people had taken “extraordinary measures to flee oppression”, but had gone on to become “law-abiding citizens playing by the rules and paying their taxes as proud Britons”.  Steve Valdez-Symonds, refugee and migrants rights programme director at Amnesty International UK, branded the bill “legislative vandalism”, claimed it could “fatally undermine the right to asylum” and accused Patel of a “shameful dereliction of duty”, adding: “This reckless and deeply unjust bill is set to bring shame on Britain’s international reputation.”  Sonya Sceats, chief executive of Freedom from Torture, described the plans as “dripping with cruelty” and an “affront to the caring people in this country who want a kinder, fairer approach to refugees”.  More than 250 organisations – including the Refugee Council, the British Red Cross, Freedom from Torture, Refugee Action and Asylum Matters – have joined to form the coalition Together with Refugees to call for a more effective, fair and humane approach to asylum in the UK.",UK to block visas for countries refusing to take back asylum seekers,true,257582007347413851595881180649390966027

4b68af25,"For some time, scientists fearing the mass release of greenhouse gases from the carbon-rich, frozen soils of the Arctic have had at least one morsel of good news in their forecasts: They predicted most of the gas released would be carbon dioxide, which, though a greenhouse gas, drives warming more slowly than some other gases. Scientists obviously weren’t excited about more carbon dioxide emissions, but it was better than the alternative: methane, a shorter-lived but far harder-hitting gas that could cause faster bursts of warming. Now even that silver lining is in doubt. Research released Monday suggests that methane releases could be considerably more prevalent as Arctic permafrost thaws. The research finds that in waterlogged wetland soils, where oxygen is not prevalent, tiny microorganisms will produce a considerable volume of methane, a gas that doesn’t last in the air much more than a decade but has a warming effect many times that of carbon dioxide over a period of 100 years.  What we can definitely say is that the importance of methane was underestimated until now in the carbon studies,” said Christian Knobloch, a researcher at Universität Hamburg in Germany and the lead author of the study, published in Nature Climate Change. The divergent finding came after Knoblauch and his colleagues conducted a lengthy experiment, more than seven years long, monitoring patches of submerged and artificially warmed soil from Siberia in the laboratory, and gradually seeing sensitive methane-producing microorganisms become more prevalent over time. Knoblauch contends that other studies have not examined waterlogged Arctic soils for as long, and he notes that in some cases it took three years or more for the methane-generating microorganisms to really get cranking. “What we saw is that it takes a very long time until methane starts being produced, and the study that we did is really the first one which is so long,” Knoblauch said.The research was conducted along with colleagues from several institutions in Germany, Sweden and Russia. So much methane was produced in the experiment, the researchers calculated that the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from wet soils, or wetlands, will be higher than from drier soils, where carbon dioxide should indeed be the top gas released. This finding, if further confirmed, could reorient calculations of the overall potential of permafrost to worsen global warming over the coming century. For instance, one major study of the permafrost warming potential, published in 2015 in the journal Nature, played down the potential for methane release in wet soils, saying drier soils would be the bigger problem. “In spite of the more potent greenhouse gas CH4, a unit of newly thawed permafrost carbon could have a greater impact on climate over a century if it thaws and decomposes within a drier, aerobic soil as compared to an equivalent amount of carbon within a waterlogged soil or sediment,” that research found. The new study would appear to contradict this. But Knoblauch cautions that more research would have to be done to go from these results to a forecast for just how much methane could waft from permafrost in the coming decades. It will be important to know, for instance, how much thawed permafrost will be stuck in watery conditions vs. dry ones. One Arctic permafrost expert not involved in the research, Merritt Turetsky of the University of Guelph, praised the new study, noting that the researchers had spent a long time trying to uncover the behavior of tiny methane-producing organisms in watery soil. The research, she said, could help bridge the gap between field studies of waterlogged permafrost that have detected methane emissions and laboratory studies that have seemed to play down the importance of the gas. “What’s remarkable about this study is the length of time they spent tracking the communities, and I think that offers a potential reason for why field and lab studies have disagreed with each other,” Turetsky said. She said the total amount of permafrost carbon that could be vulnerable because of global warming during this century — perhaps 10 percent of it, which would be more than enough to undermine global climate goals — probably won’t change in light of the new research. But the fraction of that carbon that is emitted as methane, as opposed to carbon dioxide, will be crucial, she said, and remains to be determined. “We absolutely have to partition that total permafrost carbon release into those two forms, because it really matters,” Turetsky said. “So I think that has got to be where the community goes next.” But Róisín Commane, a research associate at Harvard who studies the Arctic atmosphere and also was not involved in this research, was more skeptical about relying on this study to assume a worse verdict about methane. The study was “very nicely done,” she said, but the tendency of wet soils to produce methane could be counteracted by several factors. The soils could also become host to organisms that devour that methane — and turn it into carbon dioxide. And, as the Arctic continues to warm, soils might not retain as much water, as the subsurface ice that held it in place gradually gives way, she noted. “How much of it makes it into the atmosphere is the big thing,” Commane said. “Ecosystems will probably produce more methane as they stay wet. The big question we have is, how much of that makes it into the atmosphere, and I don’t think they get to that question here.”",The arctics carbon bomb might be even more potent than we thought,true,
,"Anthony “Tony” Fauci has become the scientific face of America’s COVID-19 response, and he says the best evidence shows the virus behind the pandemic was not made in a lab in China.  Fauci, the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, shot down the discussion that has been raging among politicians and pundits, calling it “a circular argument” in a conversation Monday with National Geographic.  “If you look at the evolution of the virus in bats and what's out there now, [the scientific evidence] is very, very strongly leaning toward this could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated … Everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that [this virus] evolved in nature and then jumped species,” Fauci says. Based on the scientific evidence, he also doesn’t entertain an alternate theory—that someone found the coronavirus in the wild, brought it to a lab, and then it accidentally escaped.  Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.  Fauci is most concerned that the United States will be put to the test this fall and winter by a second wave of COVID-19 if the country does not blunt the infection rate by the summer.  “Shame on us if we don't have enough tests by the time this so-called return might occur in the fall and winter,” he says, advising that the U.S. needs to make sure we not only have an adequate supply of tests available before a second wave hits, but also a system for getting those tests to the people who most need them.  “I don't think there's a chance that this virus is just going to disappear,” he says. “It's going to be around, and if given the opportunity, it will resurge.” As such, Fauci says the U.S. should also focus this summer on properly reinforcing the nation’s health care system, ensuring the availability of hospital beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment for health care workers.  He also stressed the importance of continuing to social distance everywhere until the case counts start to fall in cities and states. The U.S. witnessed about 20,000 to 30,000 new cases every day in the month of April, suggesting the country is stuck in its peak.  Still, he remains optimistic that a vaccine will be ready within an historically short time frame, citing one promising candidate that he thinks may move into advanced clinical trials by the early summer. Fauci has said that he thinks a final vaccine could be available for general use as early as January, which would break records for the speed at which previous vaccines were developed.  5:03  One reason for his confidence is the “impressive” results being seen now in animals tested with a vaccine candidate made by Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna Therapeutics, which brought it into human trials in a record 42 days. The candidate is what is known as an mRNA vaccine—a drug that uses snippets of a virus’s genetic material—rather than the dead or weakened virus itself—to build the proteins that trigger the body’s protective immune response.  To date, no type of mRNA vaccine has been licensed for use in humans, but Fauci believes there is great promise for this technology targeting the coronavirus, based in part on his experience developing treatments for HIV/AIDS in the 1980s and ‘90s.  “For some reason that we're still struggling with, the body does not make an adequate immune response to HIV,” he says. To fight off that virus, a vaccine has to work better than the body’s own natural response. By contrast, “it's obvious that many people make a very adequate immune response” to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the animal trials so far show that modest doses of the mRNA vaccine for coronavirus have also generated a strong immune response.  He adds that NIAID is still developing and supporting multiple vaccine efforts, in case those that go into trials soonest don’t ultimately prove safe and effective. “You want a lot of shots on goal. We want four or five candidates that we put out there all within a reasonable time,” he says.  Fauci told National Geographic he’s concerned about states rushing to reopen before their infection rates fall. He also shared how he manages the barrage of new scientific information being released about COVID-19, and how his family and faith keep him going despite his increasingly hectic schedule.  (The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.)  Fauci on the vaccine  You’ve been the NIAID director since 1984, witnessing dozens of disease outbreaks. One of the first was the HIV/AIDS epidemic. How does that experience compare with COVID-19?  One of the important advantages is what we call targeted drug development. Viruses cause disease by binding to receptors on cells in your body, be they in your upper airway or in your lung, in the case of COVID-19. They then replicate at a rapid rate that triggers a variety of pathogenic processes. Targeting drugs to interfere at one or more vulnerable sites within this replication cycle is something that we learned with HIV.  Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Bush presents the Presidential Medal of Freedom on June 19, 2008 to Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infections Diseases, in Bethesda, Maryland during ceremonies at the White House. The Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award, recognizes exceptional meritorious service. Photograph by Karen Bleier, AFP via Getty Images  SARS-CoV-2 [the virus that causes COVID-19] has the same sort of vulnerable points. We need to identify them and develop drugs, either alone or in combination, to block the replication.  Are there also lessons from HIV/AIDS that relate to developing a COVID-19 vaccine?  Vaccines are a bit different. We have a better chance of quickly getting, relatively speaking, a vaccine for the novel coronavirus than we did for HIV, because for some reason that’s still unknown the body does not make an adequate immune response to HIV.  We don't necessarily have that challenge with this coronavirus because it's obvious that many people make a very adequate immune response. They clear the virus, and they do well. As we know from the natural history of this disease, the majority of people actually either get well without any symptoms—they're called asymptomatic—or they have minimal symptoms, where they get a fever, some aches, and then they recover.  The fact that the majority of people can actually clear the virus is a very good sign for the feasibility of developing a vaccine.  The two most widely discussed vaccine candidates are an mRNA vaccine from Moderna, which reached human trials in a record 42 days, and Oxford University’s candidate, based on what’s known as a nonreplicating viral vector. Yet no vaccine based on these two technologies has ever been licensed for human use. What makes these two vaccines seem so promising, especially on this expedited timeline?  These vaccines are inducing, at least in animal models, really rather substantial immune responses, particularly the mRNA vaccine. When we look at the immune response that you can induce with a modest dose—one that's feasible to be translated into humans—and the amount of time it takes to get to that level of immunity, it is really quite impressive. It is also really easy to scale up with these two, in the sense of making a lot of doses pretty quickly. So you're right, they have not been approved, as many of the other vaccine platforms have, but the promise is great.  We at NIAID are either developing or supporting the development of multiple candidates. You want a lot of shots on goal. We want four or five candidates that we put out there all within a reasonable time—maybe June, July, or August—to get them into an advanced trial. The mRNA one is already well into phase one of clinical trials, and we're getting ready to go into phase two and three sometime in the early summer.  Fauci on reopening and masks  As states move to reopen businesses and warmer weather lures people outside, how concerned are you about a fresh spike in infections in the U.S.?  Take a look at the guidelines for Opening Up America Again. There are very well delineated checkpoints. There's a gateway where infections must go down for 14 days before you can enter into phase one for reopening. If you fulfill the requirements of phase one, you move to phase two. If you do it there, you go to phase three.  So when you see somebody in an environment in which the infections are not going down, and then you see 30 to 40 people on a beach with no mask … well that's very nice to have fun in the sun, but you're really putting yourself and everyone at risk for creating an even bigger spike in infections.  Do you fear a second wave?  What’s impressed me the most—but clearly in a disturbing way—is the extraordinary efficiency of how the virus spreads. It spreads so much more efficiently than influenza does. You see situations where people at home try and physically separate; they have no contact except they've touched the plate or a doorknob, and they wind up getting infected.  The clusters in families, the outbreaks on the Teddy Roosevelt aircraft carrier, the enormous spread on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama harbor—it’s a very, very transmissible virus.  Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.  We're going to be put to the test as we move toward the fall and winter of this year. If we do it correctly, then we could be able to blunt and diminish the daily rate of infections in this country as we get into the summer. I can't guarantee it, but if we do things right, that likely will happen.  But I don't think there's a chance that this virus is just going to disappear. It's going to be around, and if given the opportunity, it will resurge. We now will have a few months—May June, July, August—to prepare, by making sure our health system is adequately supplied with ventilators, ICU beds, personal protective equipment, etcetera. We need to not only have tests, but to make sure the people who need tests can get tested.  So that by the time we get to September, we don't have the dialogue continually fixating on do you have enough tests? Shame on us if we don't have enough tests by the time this so-called return might occur in the fall and winter.  What’s your position on the general public wearing face masks?  I'm glad you asked, because it has evolved over the weeks and months. When there was first discussion, it was at a time when face masks—either surgical masks or N95 respirators—were at high scarcity.  Let's assume that we now have enough masks or that you could easily make a cloth covering, as was suggested appropriately by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I think those are reasonable assumptions. We know that the masks are better in the health-care setting to prevent someone who's infected from coughing and sneezing and infecting people in the environment. When you look at what the mask does for the general population, the data are not 100 percent: It doesn't 100 percent protect you from infecting somebody else, and it certainly doesn't 100 percent prevent somebody else from infecting you.  But if you wear a mask, you are getting some protection for yourself, and if you happen to be infected and don't know it, you're to some extent preventing transmission to someone else. Given that, it just makes sense that first of all, the best way to prevent spread is to maintain the physical distance of six feet.  So, if you're in a situation where you're in contact with no one, then you don't have to be walking around with a mask all day, that's for sure. But if you are in a situation where you are going to be within the realm of six feet—the grocery store or even walking out on the street—then wear it.  Fauci on the information deluge and the “virus made in Chinese lab” claim.  How do you keep up with the barrage of information and filter down to the most important science?  It's like drinking from a fire hydrant. It really is. Fortunately for me, I have a staff of three to four really good people who sift through the papers and when something looks unreasonable or “pie in the sky,” they don't bother me with that. Then when all of these studies come across my desk, I read the title and the abstract. If it looks feasible, I'll put it aside and try and read it. When it's something that they think I should read, they make sure I read it.  Even with that screening process, it's still very difficult to consume everything that's out there, particularly with this relatively recent trend with these non-peer-reviewed, pre-publications [that have not gone through traditional vetting to appear in major journals].  So, what's your advice to the public at-large for sifting through the headlines and making sense of it all?  Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.  Anybody can claim to be an expert even when they have no idea what they're talking about—and it's very difficult for the general public to distinguish. So, make sure the study is coming from a reputable organization that generally gives you the truth—though even with some reputable organizations, you occasionally get an outlier who's out there talking nonsense. If something is published in places like New England Journal of Medicine, Science, Nature, Cell, or JAMA—you know, generally that is quite well peer reviewed because the editors and the editorial staff of those journals really take things very seriously.  One topic in the news lately has been the origins of SAR-CoV-2. Do you believe or is there evidence that the virus was made in the lab in China or accidentally released from a lab in China?  If you look at the evolution of the virus in bats, and what's out there now is very, very strongly leaning toward this [virus] could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated—the way the mutations have naturally evolved. A number of very qualified evolutionary biologists have said that everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that it evolved in nature and then jumped species.  Sure, but what if scientists found the virus outside the lab, brought it back, and then it escaped?  But that means it was in the wild to begin with. That's why I don't get what they're talking about [and] why I don't spend a lot of time going in on this circular argument.  Fauci’s life right now  What’s your typical day like?  I get up around five o'clock in the morning, and I usually wind up running downstairs, getting a quick breakfast, and looking at a thousand emails—literally a thousand.  I then head to the NIH [National Institutes of Health] for my day job—trying to develop a vaccine and drugs and running a $6 billion institution. I stay there until around one o'clock, and then I go down to the White House for multiple meetings. First, I meet with the doctor group—myself, coronavirus response coordinator Debbie Birx, director Bob Redfield from the CDC, commissioner Steve Hahn from FDA, and others. We then go into the task force meeting run by Vice President [Mike Pence], which usually lasts about an hour and a half. We summarize this pre-brief with the vice president and then go brief President [Donald Trump] for the press conference.  Then, the work starts … I head home or back to the NIH and work until the wee hours of the morning. The whole day is punctuated by everybody needing to talk to you: every governor in the states, every congressional leader, every leader in the White House. It's constant conference calls. It's an almost impossible situation—and that's seven days a week.  Then you superimpose upon that all the press you do—the TV or the radio or the interviews. It's kind of a surrealistic state. I have to wake up in the morning and literally, without being facetious, ask my wife, what day is it?  Wow, how do you unwind?  I power walk with my wife, usually at night or on the weekends. It's dark, but we still do it anyway.  Has it ever been too taxing?  A couple of months ago, I was foolish and just thought I could get away with almost no sleep. I mean, like three hours a night. I did that for a few weeks, and it almost killed me. It really wore me down badly. Thank goodness I have a very intelligent and clinically skilled wife who turned things around and said, You got to remember to eat, and you've got to remember to sleep. The day is still impossible, but I don't think I'm going to drop dead from it. I hope not.  You went to a Jesuit high school, where you learned the importance of doing good for the public. How has that experience informed your professional life?  My whole life was almost served to me on the basis that my mother and father were very much oriented toward service. They were never really interested in money or material things. That's just the way they were, both of them. So I never knew there was anything like going out there and making a lot of money, and that was really cemented when I went both to a Jesuit high school and a Jesuit college, where the entire theme was service for others.  I almost never had any other inkling of doing anything except something that would have a public service component to it. I'm very much of a people person, but I'm also scientifically inclined.

,"As several airlines south of the border announce rules for new hires to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, some experts are saying that the same should be considered by airlines in Canada as well.  Over the last month, major U.S. air carriers Delta and United Airlines said that they would require new employees to show proof that they’ve been vaccinated against the coronavirus, citing it as a move to further safeguard its employees and customers.  The airline industry has been among the hardest hit over the course of the pandemic, shedding thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of revenue since the onset of COVID-19.  4:06 Pressure mounts on Canada to come up with a travel restart plan Pressure mounts on Canada to come up with a travel restart plan – May 13, 2021  Story continues below advertisement  But now, as vaccination rates continue to ramp up across many parts of the world, including in Canada, many airlines have begun to announce a reopening of air routes and rehiring of their employees.  Last Thursday, Air Canada said it would begin recalling over 2,600 employees across various roles in preparation for a surge in demand for flights.  While none of the Canadian airlines have announced or made public any plans to mandate COVID-19 vaccines in returning or newly hired employees, several public health and travel experts have pointed to the move as a step in the right direction.  2:34 Why more Canadians are taking life on the road during the pandemic Why more Canadians are taking life on the road during the pandemic – Jun 14, 2021  Dr. Jason Kindrachuk, a virologist at the University of Manitoba, told Global News in an interview Sunday that mandating vaccinations for workers in the travel industry, which offers vectors of “massive” virus transmission, is an option that should really be considered.  Story continues below advertisement  Kindrachuk said the travel industry in Canada has for the most part done relatively well in managing its transmissions, despite people travelling together in enclosed spaces like airplanes.  “That being said, you don’t need to have a lot of transmissions to have concerns. We really need to have one or two cases that ultimately lead to the initiation of new COVID transmissions, and that’s the concern,” he said.  Any way to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus, like vaccinating employees, should be an important factor in deciding new policies or mandates, he said.  Kindrachuk’s comments come after recent federal data pointed to domestic flights in Canada accounting for 80 per cent of COVID-19 cases among air travellers.  The data, released last month, revealed that 226 domestic flights between April and May of this year had at least one person who tested positive for COVID-19, compared to the 50 planes with positive cases entering Canada internationally.  Canada has over the last year and half imposed stringent measures on international travel to the country, including a flight an from India and Pakistan over concerns rising COVID-19 cases. The same level of restrictions, however, do not apply to passengers travelling domestically.

Experts have previously warned of the threat the variant poses to big provincial reopening plans.  “We’re in a position, unfortunately, that the virus now is much better [at spreading] than it was even a year ago — even six months ago,” said Kindrachuk of the Delta variant.  “So we don’t have that same ability to implement things like masking and distancing to try and combat the virus anymore because there are ways for that virus to just be able to be transmitted at a higher rate.”  Story continues below advertisement  According to Toronto-based employment lawyer Andrew Monkhouse, any move to mandate vaccinations could be met with a slew of ethical — and legal — implications.  While Canada doesn’t have a law in place preventing businesses from requiring people to be vaccinated, any requests to do so could potentially be challenged by individuals on the basis of Canadian human rights law, he said.  Monkhouse said that what he expects to see in place from most airlines, and even others in the consumer industry, is a system that generally requires its employees to be vaccinated, but can potentially accommodate on a case-by-case basis, whether it’s due to health or reasons or beliefs that prevent them from getting the vaccine.  “I certainly think airlines, because it’s a customer safety issue and also, frankly, getting people trying to get people back on planes, they need a certain volume to make money. You have to have a full plane, so certainly we’re going to see that,” saidMonkhouse said, adding that he’s even started to see a preference for vaccinated employees to return to work in retail.  Two of Canada’s largest airlines, Air Canada and WestJet, told Global News they are recommending employees to get their vaccinations at this time.

Health Canada did not have a statement ready by time of publication.  A spokesperson from WestJet did not specifically comment on whether they would consider mandating vaccines for their employees, but added their chief medical officer was continuing to drive awareness of vaccinations “both internally and externally, in the effort to inform and educate WestJetters.”  Canadian airlines Sunwing and Air Transat did not respond to requests asking whether or not they were considering enforcing vaccine mandates on employees or customers.  Story continues below advertisement  According to Marty Firestone, president of Travel Secure, the concept of fully vaccinating airline employees and others in the travel industry is one that is “absolutely paramount” to the industry’s reopening.  “If you’re suggesting that potentially an employee or an airline person that could come in contact with me, from any agent to a flight attendant to a baggage handler, may not want to have both shots and be there working is a pretty scary thought,” said Firestone.  Firestone, who is a specialist in travel insurance and safety, said that knowing whether or not airline employees or others on the plane have had their two shots would make his clients feel much more comfortable to fly and travel again.  5:32 Emerging travel trends and preferences post-pandemic Emerging travel trends and preferences post-pandemic – Jun 10, 2021  He added that many insurance companies were also beginning to recognize and incentivize those with vaccinations.

,"As part of that investigation, Barr and John Durham, the federal prosecutor he appointed to conduct it, have been probing a conspiracy theory for which there is little if any evidence, according to several people with knowledge of the matter: that a key player in the Russia probe, a professor named Joseph Mifsud, was actually a Western intelligence asset sent to discredit the Trump campaign — and that the CIA, under Brennan, was somehow involved.  Trump, meanwhile, has become “obsessed” with Brennan, who frequently gets under the president’s skin by publicly questioning his mental acuity and fitness for office, according to a former White House official. On Brennan, “it was always, ‘he’s an idiot, he’s a crook, we ought to investigate him,’” this person said, characterizing Trump’s outbursts.  Since the beginning of his presidency, Trump has also repeatedly attacked Brennan publicly, tweeting about the former CIA director more than two dozen times. He’s questioned Brennan’s mental acuity and called him a liar, a leaker and blamed him for having “detailed knowledge of the (phony) Dossier,” a reference to the raw intelligence reports on Trump’s alleged Russia ties by British former MI-6 officer Christopher Steele. He also tried to unilaterally strip Brennan of his security clearance — a process the White House reportedly never went through with — and urged the House to call him in for questioning.  ....top of the FBI. Brennan started this entire debacle about President Trump. We now know that Brennan had detailed knowledge of the (phony) Dossier...he knows about the Dossier, he denies knowledge of the Dossier, he briefs the Gang of 8 on the Hill about the Dossier, which.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 21, 2018  The emerging focus of the Barr-Durham investigation — the CIA and intelligence community’s work with the FBI on the Russia probe — emphasizes the increasingly blurred lines between politics and law enforcement in the Trump era. In May, Trump gave Barr unprecedented authority to review the intelligence community’s “surveillance activities” during the 2016 election, issuing a sweeping declassification order that granted Barr “unprecedented” powers over the nation’s secrets, former officials said.  It was a break with protocol that Trump’s allies see as a necessary check on the so-called “deep state” but that critics have lambasted as an attempt to create the impression of scandal—especially given Barr’s comments earlier this year hinting at a predisposed belief that inappropriate “spying” occurred in 2016 and that the Steele dossier may have been Russian disinformation.  Barr’s evidently close involvement with the Durham probe is in keeping with his reputation as a micromanager—and a fierce advocate of presidential prerogatives. As attorney general during the George H.W. Bush administration, he described later for an oral history interview, he comes across as a seasoned, bare-knuckled bureaucratic brawler who closely coordinated his actions with the White House counsel’s office.  “He was very competent and very detail-oriented,” said Bill Kristol, who was chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle and worked with Barr back then. Barr was “a very involved manager” of his department, Kristol said.  Durham’s report is likely to land well after the results of an inquiry by the Justice Department’s Inspector General, who is examining the FBI’s applications to a secret court in 2016 and 2017 to obtain surveillance warrants on a Trump campaign aide. Trump-friendly commentators have been raising expectations about the IG report, predicting that it will show the FBI purposefully misled the court to surveil Trump’s campaign, and have expressed frustration in recent days over its delayed release.  But former FBI officials on the receiving end of that probe say the president’s allies are setting themselves up for disappointment.  “Is the IG report going to say we made mistakes? Yes,” said one of the former officials. “But it won’t say we did so for some nefarious purpose. So the report will be a dry hole for Trump and his supporters. Which is why [Barr and Durham] have now gone to this other theory, positing that the CIA was engaged in some rogue operation to overthrow Trump and therefore feeding the FBI bullshit,” he said. “It’s complete nonsense.”  “Haven’t you heard?” said another former FBI official, sarcastically. “Brennan was a puppet-master and we were just his puppets.”  Brennan has spoken openly about working closely with the FBI on counterintelligence investigations, and acknowledged in an op-ed last year that he had “many conversations” with former FBI Director James Comey in 2016 “about the potential for American citizens, involved in partisan politics or not, to be pawns in Russian hands.”  The FBI launched its counterintelligence probe after learning that a Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, was offered “dirt” on Hillary Clinton from a Russian proxy — Mifsud — and had told an Australian diplomat about it. Australian officials tipped off their American counterparts to Papadopoulos’s admission, though it’s still unclear who was initially tipped off, and that’s reportedly a subject of Barr’s investigation. The bureau then flew former FBI agent Peter Strzok over to London to interview Alexander Downer and an associate about his interactions with Papadopoulos.  Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his relationship with Mifsud, but he has since claimed, without evidence, that the professor was actually an intelligence plant sent by the CIA to entrap him and give the FBI an excuse to open an investigation.  The two agencies have a fraught history that at times has descended into open bureaucratic warfare. After the 9/11 attacks, for instance, officials at the CIA and the FBI blamed one another for lapses that failed to stop al Qaeda. And they sharply differed in their approaches to interrogating terrorist suspects, with FBI officials blasting their counterparts in Langley as brutish amateurs in the art of extracting valuable information.

In Salida, Colorado, residents have noticed the change through more lawn watering, increased air conditioning sales and bigger fires. (June 18) AP  Collapsing polar ice caps, a green Sahara Desert, a 20-foot sea-level rise.  That's the potential future of Earth, a new study suggests, noting that global warming could be twice as warm as current climate models predict.  The rate of warming is also remarkable: “The changes we see today are much faster than anything encountered in Earth’s history. In terms of rate of change, we are in uncharted waters,” said study co-author Katrin Meissner of the University of New South Wales in Australia.  This could mean the landmark Paris Climate Agreement – which seeks to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels – may not be enough to ward off catastrophe.  “Even with just 2 degrees of warming – and potentially just 1.5 degrees – significant impacts on the Earth system are profound,” said study co-author Alan Mix, a scientist from Oregon State University.  “We can expect that sea-level rise could become unstoppable for millennia, impacting much of the world’s population, infrastructure and economic activity,” Mix said.  In looking at Earth's past, scientists can predict what the future will look like. In the study, the researchers looked back at natural global warming periods over the past 3.5 million years and compared them to current man-made warming.  By combining a wide range of measurements from ice cores, sediment layers, fossil records, dating using atomic isotopes and many other established paleoclimate methods, the researchers pieced together the impact of those climatic changes.  Human-inflicted climate change is caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, which release heat-trapping greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into the the atmosphere.  Study lead author Hubertus Fischer of the University of Bern in Switzerland and his team found that our current climate predictions may underestimate long-term warming by as much as a factor of two.  Meissner said that ""climate models appear to be trustworthy for small changes, such as for low-emission scenarios over short periods, say over the next few decades out to 2100. But as the change gets larger or more persistent ... it appears they underestimate climate change.""  The research also revealed how large areas of the polar ice caps could collapse and significant changes to ecosystems could see the Sahara Desert become green and the edges of tropical forests turn into fire-dominated savanna.  However, Meissner said ""we cannot comment on how far in the future these changes will occur.""  Referring to the study findings, lead author Fischer said that without serious reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, there is ""very little margin for error to meet the Paris targets.”  The study, which was conducted by dozens of researchers from 17 countries, was published last week in Nature Geoscience, a peer-reviewed British journal.","Global warming could be far worse than predicted, new study suggests",true,

,"Corbis via Getty Images  Bill Gates, the fourth richest person in the world and a self-described nerd who is known for his early programming skills rather than his love of the outdoors, has been quietly snatching up 242,000 acres of farmland across the U.S. — enough to make him the top private farmland owner in America.  After years of reports that he was purchasing agricultural land in places like Florida and Washington, The Land Report revealed that Gates, who has a net worth of nearly $121 billion according to Forbes, has built up a massive farmland portfolio spanning 18 states. His largest holdings are in Louisiana (69,071 acres), Arkansas (47,927 acres) and Nebraska (20,588 acres). Additionally, he has a stake in 25,750 acres of transitional land on the west side of Phoenix, Arizona, which is being developed as a new suburb.  According to The Land Report’s research, the land is held directly and through third-party entities by Cascade Investments, Gates’ personal investment vehicle. Cascade’s other investments include food-safety company Ecolab, used-car retailer Vroom and Canadian National Railway.  While it may be surprising that a tech billionaire would also be the biggest farmland owner in the country, this is not Gates’ only foray into agriculture. In 2008, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced $306 million in grants to promote high-yield, sustainable agriculture among smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The foundation has further invested in the development and proliferation of “super crops” resistant to climate change and higher-yield dairy cows. Last year, the organization announced Gates Ag One, a nonprofit to advance those efforts.  It is not entirely clear how Gates’ farmland is being used, or whether any of the land is being set aside for conservation. (Cascade did not return Forbes’ request for comment.) However, there is some indication that the land could be used in a way that aligns with the foundation’s values. Cottonwood Ag Management, a subsidiary of Cascade, is a member of Leading Harvest, a nonprofit that promotes sustainable agriculture standards that prioritize protections of crops, soil and water resources.  Gates is not the only billionaire on The Land Report’s list of top private farmland owners. Wonderful Company cofounders Stewart and Lynda Resnick (net worth: $7.1 billion) ranked number three with 190,000 acres. Their farmland produces the goods for their brands including POM Wonderful, Wonderful Pistachios and Wonderful Halos mandarins.  While Gates may be the country’s biggest farmland owner, he by no means is the largest individual landowner. In its list of 100 top American landowners, The Land Report gives the top spot to Liberty Media Chair John Malone, who owns 2.2 million acres of ranches and forests. CNN founder Ted Turner ranked number three with 2 million acres of ranch land across eight states.

,"London (CNN) — More than a third of the Antarctic ice shelf risks collapsing into the sea if global temperatures reach 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels as climate change warms the world, a new study from the UK's University of Reading has warned. In a forecasting study, scientists found that 34% of the area of all Antarctic ice shelves, measuring some half a million square kilometers, could destabilize if world temperatures were to rise by 4 degrees. Some 67% of the ice shelf area on the Antarctic Peninsula would be at risk of destabilization under this scenario, researchers said. Ice shelves are permanent floating platforms of ice attached to areas of the coastline, formed where glaciers flowing off the land meet the sea. They can help limit the rise in global sea levels by acting like a dam, slowing the flow of melting ice and water into the oceans. Each summer, ice at the surface of ice shelves melts and runs into smaller gaps in the snow below, where it usually refreezes. But when there is a lot of melting and little snowfall, this water instead pools onto the ice's surface or flows into crevasses. This deepens and widens the crevasses, causing the shelf to fracture and collapse into the sea. This huge iceberg calved from the Larsen C ice shelf. This huge iceberg calved from the Larsen C ice shelf. ""Ice shelves are important buffers preventing glaciers on land from flowing freely into the ocean and contributing to sea level rise. When they collapse, it's like a giant cork being removed from a bottle, allowing unimaginable amounts of water from glaciers to pour into the sea,"" study lead author Ella Gilbert, a climate scientist in the University of Reading's Department of Meteorology, said in a statement. Gilbert told CNN that low-lying coastal areas, particularly small island states such Vanuatu and Tuvalu, in the South Pacific Ocean, are most at risk from global sea level rise. ""However, coastal areas all over the world would be vulnerable, and countries with fewer resources available to mitigate and adapt to sea level rise will see worse consequences,"" she said. In the new study, which used high-resolution regional climate modeling to predict the impact of increased melting and water runoff on ice shelf stability, researchers say that limiting temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius rather than 4 degrees Celsius would halve the area at risk and potentially avoid significant sea level rise. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in a landmark report that we only have until 2030 to drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and prevent the planet from reaching the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. This image shows a large iceberg which has separated from Pine Island Glacier. This image shows a large iceberg which has separated from Pine Island Glacier. Global net emissions of carbon dioxide would need to fall by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach ""net zero"" around 2050 in order to keep the warming around 1.5 degrees Celsius. ""The findings highlight the importance of limiting global temperature increases as set out in the Paris Agreement if we are to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, including sea level rise,"" Gilbert added. In the Paris accord, 197 countries agreed to the goal of holding global temperatures ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Antarctic sponges discovered under the ice shelf perplex scientists Related Article: Antarctic sponges discovered under the ice shelf perplex scientists But we are on track for a world that is 3.2 degrees Celsius warmer by the end of the century. Gilbert told CNN that increased temperatures means melting occurs more frequently, and more intensely. Researchers identified four ice shelves that would be threatened by a warmer climate: The Larsen C, Shackleton, Pine Island and Wilkins ice shelves, which are vulnerable due to their geography, and the runoff predicted in those areas. Larsen C is the largest remaining ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula, and the Pine Island glacier has received a lot of attention in recent years because it has been melting rapidly in response to climate change, Gilbert said. If these ice shelves all collapsed, which is not guaranteed, the glaciers they currently restrain would flow into the ocean, contributing to sea level rise -- potentially by tens of centimeters, she explained. The study was published Thursday in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.",A third of Antarctic ice shelf risks collapse as our planet warms,true,335500145991990906472673787922577910324
,"Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far? By Tom Edgington  BBC Reality Check Published 21 October 2021  Image source, Getty Images  The UK has agreed a free trade agreement in principle with New Zealand.  Since Brexit, the UK has had the freedom to pursue its own trade deals. So far, it has signed trade deals and agreements in principle with 69 countries and one with the EU.  However, the majority are ""rollover"" deals - copying the terms of deals the UK already had when it was an EU member, rather than creating new benefits.  What is a free trade deal?  A free trade deal aims to encourage trade between countries by making it cheaper. This normally applies to goods, but occasionally to services as well.  Making trade cheaper is usually achieved by reducing or eliminating tariffs. These are government taxes or charges for trading goods across borders. A car importer might have to pay a 20% tariff on top of the vehicle's price, for example, to bring it into a country.  Trade agreements also aim to remove quotas (limits on the amount of goods that can be traded).  Trade can also be made simpler if countries have the same rules, such as the colour of wires in plugs. The closer the rules are, the less likely that goods need to be checked.  Image source, EPA Image caption, The UK-Japan deal was signed in October 2020  Why have tariffs and quotas at all?  While free trade agreements aim to boost trade, too many cheap imports could threaten a country's manufacturers. This could affect jobs.  For that reason, a government might choose to put tariffs on certain things. Tariffs on car imports, for example, could help protect local car makers from cheaper vehicles coming in from abroad.  What is the UK-New Zealand deal?  The latest UK trade deal is an agreement in principle reached with New Zealand on 20 October.  New Zealand is a small UK trading partner, accounting for less than 0.2% GDP. So the deal is unlikely to boost the UK economy by much. However, the deal could lead to more New Zealand lamb being sold in the UK.  As well as removing tariffs on goods such as clothing and machinery, the UK government says the deal will also cut red tape for businesses. Labour and the National Farmers Union, however, say the deal could hurt UK farmers and lower food standards.  What does the UK-EU trade deal mean?  After Brexit happened on 31 January 2020, the UK and EU needed to decide the rules for their future trading relationship.  This was important because the EU is the UK's largest and closest trading partner.  After months of negotiation - which went down to the wire - a UK-EU trade deal came into force on 1 January 2021.  The deal prevented any tariffs and quotas being introduced - which would have made it more expensive to trade.  Image source, Getty Images Image caption, The UK-EU trade deal went down to the wire, with fishing proving to be one of the major sticking points  But not everything is the same as it was before Brexit.  As the UK no longer has to follow EU rules on product standards, new checks have been introduced.  Strict EU laws on animal products also mean some UK products can no longer be exported.  The deal also does not completely eliminate the possibility of tariffs in future. Both sides will need to stay close to shared rules in areas like workers' rights and environmental protection. If either the UK or the EU shift their rules too far, the other side could introduce tariffs.  What happened to the trade agreements the UK was already part of?  Before Brexit, the UK was automatically part of any trade deal the EU had negotiated with another country. At the time the UK left, the EU had about 40 trade deals covering more than 70 countries.  The UK has negotiated rollover deals with 63 of these countries.  Image source, Getty Images  The UK is still discussing rollover agreements with a further three countries, but all the major ones are done.  Any existing EU agreement that was not rolled over ended on 31 December with trade then taking place on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms until a deal could be reached.  Trading on WTO terms means importers face tariffs and extra paperwork. For example, a shipment of bananas arriving at Portsmouth from Ghana was charged a tariff of £17,500 in January. Since then, an agreement with Ghana has been reached.  What about a UK-US trade deal?  The US is already a significant UK trading partner, accounting for £1 in every £6 of British trade.  Some smaller deals have already been reached - such as the export of British beef to the US, after a ban of more 20 years.  What about other trade agreements?  Image source, Getty Images Image caption, British farmers are worried about competing with cheap foreign imports, such as beef  The Australia deal, announced on 15 June, was the first trade agreement negotiated from scratch by the UK since it left the EU - although it has not yet been signed off and implemented.  UK farmers say the deal will mean they will be undercut by cheap imports, which will cost jobs. However, the UK government says the agreement means many British products will be cheaper to sell to Australia. It also insists the deal will contain protections for farmers, such as a cap on tariff-free imports for 15 years.  A deal with Japan was signed in October 2020 - the first that differed from an existing EU deal.",Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far?,true,180825809422023326749205504588279799909
,"Anthony Fauci is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Gary Nabel is director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Francis Collins is director of the National Institutes of Health.  A deadly influenza virus has circulated widely in birds in recent years, decimating flocks but rarely spreading to humans. Nonetheless, because of its persistence in bird flocks, this highly pathogenic avian influenza virus has loomed as a major public health threat. Seasonal influenza kills less than 1 percent of the people it infects. In contrast, human infections with H5N1, though exceedingly rare, are fatal in more than half of cases. Should this virus mutate in a way that allows it to be transmitted as efficiently among people as seasonal influenza viruses are, it could take an unprecedented toll on human life.  A number of important scientific and public health questions regarding this virus remain unanswered, including the likelihood of such mutations arising and the mechanisms by which they may occur. Two recent studies co-funded by the National Institutes of Health have shed light on how this potentially grave human health threat could become a reality. Working carefully with influenza viruses they have engineered in isolated biocontainment laboratories, scientists in Europe and the United States have identified several mechanisms by which the virus might evolve to transmit efficiently in the ferret, the best animal model for human influenza infection. This research has allowed identification of genetic pathways by which such a virus could better adapt to transmission among people. This laboratory virus does not exist in nature. There is, however, considerable concern that such a virus could evolve naturally. We cannot predict whether it or something similar will arise naturally, nor when or where it might appear.  Given these uncertainties, important information and insights can come from generating a potentially dangerous virus in the laboratory. While the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention provide excellent public health surveillance for novel influenza strains, influenza outbreaks still occur suddenly and in unexpected places. The recent H1N1 pandemic exemplifies the problem: In 2009, a new influenza virus emerged. It was shown to have originated from an animal reservoir, and it spread so rapidly that it strained the pharmaceutical industry’s capacity to prepare vaccines fast enough to blunt its spread. We do not fully understand the underlying factors that allow influenza viruses to be transmitted efficiently in humans after they emerge from different species. The ferret transmission studies were intended in part to fill these important gaps in knowledge.  Understanding the biology of influenza virus transmission has implications for outbreak prediction, prevention and treatment. In defining the mutations required for mammalian transmission, public health officials are provided with genetic signatures that, like fingerprints, could help scientists more readily identify newly emergent, potentially harmful viruses, track their spread and detect threatening outbreaks. The ability to identify such viruses even a few months faster than by conventional surveillance provides critical time to slow or stop an outbreak. For example, the CDC implements public health protective measures and stockpiles antiviral drugs. Identifying threatening viruses can also facilitate the early stages of manufacturing vaccines that protect against such a virus in advance of an outbreak.  In addition, determining the molecular Achilles’ heel of these viruses can allow scientists to identify novel antiviral drug targets that could be used to prevent infection in those at risk or to better treat those who become infected. Decades of experience tells us that disseminating information gained through biomedical research to legitimate scientists and health officials provides a critical foundation for generating appropriate countermeasures and, ultimately, protecting the public health.  The question is whether benefits of such research outweigh risks. The answer is not simple. A highly pathogenic bird flu virus transmissible in humans could arise in ways not predicted by laboratory studies. And it is not clear whether this laboratory virus would behave in humans as it does in ferrets. Nonetheless, new data provide valuable insights that can inform influenza preparedness and help delineate the principles of virus transmission between species.  Along with support for this research comes a responsibility to ensure that the information is used for good. Safeguarding against the potential accidental release or deliberate misuse of laboratory pathogens is imperative. The engineered viruses developed in the ferret experiments are maintained in high-security laboratories. The scientists, journal editors and funding agencies involved are working together to ensure that access to specific information that could be used to create dangerous pathogens is limited to those with an established and legitimate need to know.",A flu virus risk worth taking,true,232807530237848800979888553354847446974

Follow this story and more by signing up for national breaking news email alerts.  The delta variant of the coronavirus appears to cause more severe illness than earlier variants and spreads as easily as chickenpox, according to an internal federal health document that argues officials must “acknowledge the war has changed.” The document is an internal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention slide presentation, shared within the CDC and obtained by The Washington Post. It captures the struggle of the nation’s top public health agency to persuade the public to embrace vaccination and prevention measures, including mask-wearing, as cases surge across the United States and new research suggests vaccinated people can spread the virus.  The document strikes an urgent note, revealing the agency knows it must revamp its public messaging to emphasize vaccination as the best defense against a variant so contagious that it acts almost like a different novel virus, leaping from target to target more swiftly than Ebola or the common cold.  Some people are catching coronavirus after being vaccinated. Johns Hopkins University infectious disease expert Lisa Maragakis gives advice on how to stay safe. (Video: John Farrell/The Washington Post, Photo: The Washington Post)  It cites a combination of recently obtained, still-unpublished data from outbreak investigations and outside studies showing that vaccinated individuals infected with delta may be able to transmit the virus as easily as those who are unvaccinated. Vaccinated people infected with delta have measurable viral loads similar to those who are unvaccinated and infected with the variant.  Advertisement  “I finished reading it significantly more concerned than when I began,” Robert Wachter, chairman of the Department of Medicine at the University of California at San Francisco, wrote in an email.  CDC scientists were so alarmed by the new research that the agency earlier this week significantly changed guidance for vaccinated people even before making new data public.  The data and studies cited in the document played a key role in revamped recommendations that call for everyone — vaccinated or not — to wear masks indoors in public settings in certain circumstances, a federal health official said. That official told The Post that the data will be published in full on Friday. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky privately briefed members of Congress on Thursday, drawing on much of the material in the document.  Advertisement  One of the slides states that there is a higher risk among older age groups for hospitalization and death relative to younger people, regardless of vaccination status. Another estimates that there are 35,000 symptomatic infections per week among 162 million vaccinated Americans.  The document outlines “communication challenges” fueled by cases in vaccinated people, including concerns from local health departments about whether coronavirus vaccines remain effective and a “public convinced vaccines no longer work/booster doses needed.”  The presentation highlights the daunting task the CDC faces. It must continue to emphasize the proven efficacy of the vaccines at preventing severe illness and death while acknowledging milder breakthrough infections may not be so rare after all, and that vaccinated individuals are transmitting the virus. The agency must move the goal posts of success in full public view.  Advertisement  The CDC declined to comment.  “Although it’s rare, we believe that at an individual level, vaccinated people may spread the virus, which is why we updated our recommendation,” according to the federal health official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. “Waiting even days to publish the data could result in needless suffering and as public health professionals we cannot accept that.”  The presentation came two days after Walensky announced the reversal in guidance on masking among people who are vaccinated. On May 13, people were told they no longer needed to wear masks indoors or outdoors if they had been vaccinated. The new guidance reflects a strategic retreat in the face of the delta variant. Even people who are vaccinated should wear masks indoors in communities with substantial viral spread or when in the presence of people who are particularly vulnerable to infection and illness, the CDC said.  Advertisement  The document presents new science but also suggests a new strategy is needed on communication, noting that public trust in vaccines may be undermined when people experience or hear about breakthrough cases, especially after public health officials have described them as rare.  Matthew Seeger, a risk communication expert at Wayne State University in Detroit, said a lack of communication about breakthrough infections has proved problematic. Because public health officials had emphasized the great efficacy of the vaccines, the realization that they aren’t perfect may feel like a betrayal.  “We’ve done a great job of telling the public these are miracle vaccines,” Seeger said. “We have probably fallen a little into the trap of over-reassurance, which is one of the challenges of any crisis communication circumstance.”  Advertisement  The CDC’s revised mask guidance stops short of what the internal document calls for. “Given higher transmissibility and current vaccine coverage, universal masking is essential to reduce transmission of the Delta variant,” it states.  The document makes clear that vaccination provides substantial protection against the virus. But it also states that the CDC must “improve communications around individual risk among [the] vaccinated” because that risk depends on a host of factors, including age and whether someone has a compromised immune system.  The document includes CDC data from studies showing that the vaccines are not as effective in immunocompromised patients and nursing home residents, raising the possibility that some at-risk individuals will need an additional vaccine dose.  The presentation includes a note that the findings and conclusions are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the CDC’s official position.  Advertisement  The internal document contains some of the scientific information that influenced the CDC to change its mask guidance. The agency faced criticism from outside experts this week when it changed the mask guidance without releasing the data, a move that violated scientific norms, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.  “You don’t, when you’re a public health official, want to be saying, ‘Trust us, we know, we can’t tell you how,’” Jamieson said. “The scientific norm suggests that when you make a statement based on science, you show the science. … And the second mistake is they do not appear to be candid about the extent to which breakthroughs are yielding hospitalizations.”  The breakthrough cases are to be expected, the CDC briefing states, and will probably rise as a proportion of all cases because there are so many more people vaccinated now. This echoes data seen from studies in other countries, including highly vaccinated Singapore, where 75 percent of new infections reportedly occur in people who are partially and fully vaccinated.  Advertisement  The CDC document cites public skepticism about vaccines as one of the challenges: “Public convinced vaccines no longer work,” one of the first slides in the presentation states.  Walter A. Orenstein, associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center, said he was struck by data showing that vaccinated people who became infected with delta shed just as much virus as those who were not vaccinated. The slide references an outbreak in Barnstable County, Mass., where vaccinated and unvaccinated people shed nearly identical amounts of virus.  “I think this is very important in changing things,” Orenstein said.  A person working in partnership with the CDC on investigations of the delta variant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak, said the data came from a July 4 outbreak in Provincetown, Mass. Genetic analysis of the outbreak showed that people who were vaccinated were transmitting the virus to other vaccinated people. The person said the data was “deeply disconcerting” and a “canary in the coal mine” for scientists who had seen the data.  Advertisement  If the war has changed, as the CDC states, so has the calculus of success and failure. The extreme contagiousness of delta makes herd immunity a more challenging target, infectious-disease experts said.  “I think the central issue is that vaccinated people are probably involved to a substantial extent in the transmission of delta,” Jeffrey Shaman, a Columbia University epidemiologist, wrote in an email after reviewing the CDC slides. “In some sense, vaccination is now about personal protection — protecting oneself against severe disease. Herd immunity is not relevant as we are seeing plenty of evidence of repeat and breakthrough infections.”  The document underscores what scientists and experts have been saying for months: It is time to shift how people think about the pandemic.  Kathleen Neuzil, a vaccine expert at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said getting more people vaccinated remains the priority, but the public may also have to change its relationship to a virus almost certain to be with humanity for the foreseeable future.  “We really need to shift toward a goal of preventing serious disease and disability and medical consequences, and not worry about every virus detected in somebody’s nose,” Neuzil said. “It’s hard to do, but I think we have to become comfortable with coronavirus not going away.”  GiftOutline Gift Article","‘The war has changed’: Internal CDC document urges new messaging, warns delta infections likely more severe",true,293530899562520902379817014000181673203
,"More than 200 people the United States has sent back to El Salvador have been killed or seriously abused — including sexually assaulted and tortured — according to a new report by Human Rights Watch.  The group's investigation found that from 2013 to 2019, 138 people were killed and more than 70 others were beaten, sexually assaulted, extorted or tortured after they were sent back to the Central American country.  The report, released Wednesday, highlights the risks Salvadorans face when sent back to a country facing a humanitarian crisis, racked by extreme levels of violence. It emphasizes how efforts in the last few years by the Trump administration to restrict legal immigration — particularly asylum — have hit Salvadorans especially hard.  ""This has been a brick-by-brick erection of a legal wall by the Trump administration in an attempt to effectively end asylum in the U.S.,"" the report's co-author, Alison Leal Parker, told NBC News. ""Salvadorans are by no means the only nationality, but they are one of the populations that will suffer greatly from this.""  ""A living hell""  Juana, who requested that her real name not be used because of safety concerns, is a Salvadoran woman who suffered physical, sexual and emotional abuse at the hands of her partner and fled for the U.S. border with her 2-year-old daughter in 2015.  But Juana and her daughter are back in San Miguel — one of El Salvador's most violent areas — in the same neighborhood they fled nearly five years ago.  Eight percent of all homicides in El Salvador in 2018 happened in San Miguel, making it the second deadliest municipality in the country, according to the State Department's Overseas Security Advisory Council.  ""This is a very dangerous place. There's no safe place here because people get killed all the time,"" Juana told NBC News in Spanish. Gang members ""left me all beaten"" at work in April, she said, adding that it's been difficult to hold a steady job since criminals are always looking to extort and assault her.  Shortly after Juana got to the U.S., she was detained in a holding cell known as a ""hielera"" for its cold temperatures (""hielo"" is ""ice"" in Spanish), separated from her toddler and deported the following year without her child, even though she passed her credible fear interview.  ""Being separated from my daughter really affected me,"" Juana said. ""That's not a thing you can just overcome easily.""  Officials working the case found that Juana's former partner, her daughter's father, had reported her for human trafficking as part of his abuse. The Salvadoran government later determined she had not committed such a crime, and after a year and a half, Salvadoran and U.S. officials intervened to reunite mother and child.  For Salvadorans, doors are closing  Gang members shot and killed Adriana in 2017 after the U.S. dismissed her asylum claim and deported her back to El Salvador in 2015, according to the report, which changed Adriana's and other victim's real names to avoid identifying some of the people interviewed during the research.  Adriana, a former Salvadoran policewoman, was seeking asylum in the U.S. after being threatened by gangs.  The U.S. has deported many Salvadorans like her ""who flee the country because they have tried to enforce the law,"" Parker said. Typically, these are people who have worked on investigations or trials of gang members.  ""The consequences for these police officers and law enforcement can be life and death,"" Parker said.  The U.S. has been denying asylum applications from El Salvador even though the number of applicants increased from about 5,600 to over 60,000 from 2012 to 2017, a growth of nearly 1,000 percent.  A rise in asylum requests from people fleeing El Salvador suggests that the violence and human rights abuses in the country, ""including one of the highest murder rates in the world and very high rates of sexual violence and disappearances,"" have worsened, according to Human Rights Watch.  Ruth Aracely Monroy helps her son, Carlos, with his jacket among tents set up inside a shelter for migrants in Tijuana, Mexico, where they live after fleeing violence in El Salvador, on March 5, 2019. Gregory Bull / AP file  Gabriel G. was targeted by gangs for being in the Salvadoran military and unsuccessfully sought U.S. asylum. Gabriel told Human Rights Watch that he and his family are continually harassed by gang members after he was deported in 2018. The death threats are constant, he said.  Salvadorans facing deportation are often subjected to an immigration system that is ""harsh and punitive,"" plagued with court hearing backlogs and limited access to comprehensive legal advice, as well as ""prolonged and inhumane detention,"" according to the report.  Two U.S. attorney general decisions, one by Jeff Sessions and one by William Barr, narrowed the categories of people who can claim asylum in ways that particularly affect Salvadorans. The decisions limited the ability to seek asylum for those fleeing gang and gender-based violence or fleeing because a relative was assaulted or killed — all common reasons Salvadorans leave their country, according to the report.  High risk for longtime U.S. residents  The report emphasized the high risk of harm for longtime U.S. residents who return to El Salvador, what Parker called its ""most surprising"" finding. Those deportees may stick out in El Salvador as easy marks for gangs that control much of the country's territory.  Hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans could be deported from the U.S. in the coming years based on two Trump administration efforts to end immigration programs such as Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).  About 47 percent of the estimated 1.2 million Salvadorans living in the U.S. who are not citizens are in the country legally as lawful permanent residents or through TPS and DACA. The rest are undocumented.  Work authorizations for TPS holders are set to expire in January 2021 and DACA's future won't be decided until the Supreme Court rules on whether to keep or overturn Trump's decision to end the program.  Salvadoran soldiers patrol in downtown San Salvador, El Salvador, on March 15, 2017, after six market sellers were killed in the city. Jose Cabezas / Reuters file  Rollbacks of legal immigration protections make at least 900,000 Salvadorans who are undocumented, DACA or TPS holders vulnerable to deportation, subsequently ""sending them to face murder and attacks on their safety,"" Parker said.  The U.S. determined that only 18.2 percent of Salvadorans seeking asylum from 2014 to 2018 qualified for it. During the same time period, the U.S. deported 111,000 people to El Salvador, the report said.  Human Rights Watch said many of those denied asylum and sent back were later killed.  Under the one-year-old Migrant Protection Protocols, known as the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy, thousands of migrants waiting for U.S. immigration hearings have been sent to Mexico, in areas the State Department has deemed unsafe because of ""organized crime activity — including gun battles, murder, armed robbery, carjacking, kidnapping, forced disappearances, extortion and sexual assault.""  The report calls on the Trump administration, as well as lawmakers, to ""address due process failures in asylum adjudications"" and adopt laws that take into account the ""global realities prompting people to flee their homes,"" instead of implementing policies that ""shift responsibility for immigration enforcement to countries like Mexico"" to avoid obligations over migrants' safety.  ""Evidence continues to pile up showing that the U.S. government is knowingly signing a death sentence by forcibly returning vulnerable people to the very place they fled. It’s our responsibility to demand accountability, restore our asylum and refugee systems, and uphold our nation’s core values,” said Sen.Bob Menendez, D-N.J., the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in a statement reacting to the report.  The organization also recommends implementing additional protections under international law to help people who may have been denied asylum and will likely face risk of serious harm or death upon their deportation to El Salvador.

,"For Immediate Release: October 29, 2021  Español  Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the emergency use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 to include children 5 through 11 years of age. The authorization was based on the FDA’s thorough and transparent evaluation of the data that included input from independent advisory committee experts who overwhelmingly voted in favor of making the vaccine available to children in this age group.  Key points for parents and caregivers:  Effectiveness: Immune responses of children 5 through 11 years of age were comparable to those of individuals 16 through 25 years of age. In addition, the vaccine was found to be 90.7% effective in preventing COVID-19 in children 5 through 11.  Safety: The vaccine’s safety was studied in approximately 3,100 children age 5 through 11 who received the vaccine and no serious side effects have been detected in the ongoing study.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will meet next week to discuss further clinical recommendations.  “As a mother and a physician, I know that parents, caregivers, school staff, and children have been waiting for today’s authorization. Vaccinating younger children against COVID-19 will bring us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. “Our comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of the data pertaining to the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness should help assure parents and guardians that this vaccine meets our high standards.”  The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for children 5 through 11 years of age is administered as a two-dose primary series, 3 weeks apart, but is a lower dose (10 micrograms) than that used for individuals 12 years of age and older (30 micrograms).  In the U.S., COVID-19 cases in children 5 through 11 years of age make up 39% of cases in individuals younger than 18 years of age. According to the CDC, approximately 8,300 COVID-19 cases in children 5 through 11 years of age resulted in hospitalization. As of Oct. 17, 691 deaths from COVID-19 have been reported in the U.S. in individuals less than 18 years of age, with 146 deaths in the 5 through 11 years age group.  “The FDA is committed to making decisions that are guided by science that the public and healthcare community can trust. We are confident in the safety, effectiveness and manufacturing data behind this authorization. As part of our commitment to transparency around our decision-making, which included our public advisory committee meeting earlier this week, we have posted documents today supporting our decision and additional information detailing our evaluation of the data will be posted soon. We hope this information helps build confidence of parents who are deciding whether to have their children vaccinated,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.  The FDA has determined this Pfizer vaccine has met the criteria for emergency use authorization. Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, the known and potential benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in individuals down to 5 years of age outweigh the known and potential risks.  FDA Evaluation of Available Effectiveness Data  The effectiveness data to support the EUA in children down to 5 years of age is based on an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled study that has enrolled approximately 4,700 children 5 through 11 years of age. The study is being conducted in the U.S., Finland, Poland and Spain. Children in the vaccine group received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine containing 10 micrograms of messenger RNA per dose. The FDA analyzed data that compared the immune response of 264 participants from this study to 253 participants 16 through 25 years of age who had two higher doses of the vaccine in a previous study which determined the vaccine to be effective in preventing COVID-19. The immune responses of the younger age participants were comparable to the older participants.  The FDA also conducted a preliminary analysis of cases of COVID-19 occurring seven days after the second dose. In this analysis, among participants without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2, 3 cases of COVID-19 occurred among 1,305 vaccine recipients and 16 cases of COVID-19 occurred among 663 placebo recipients; the vaccine was 90.7% effective in preventing COVID-19.  FDA Evaluation of Available Safety Data  The available safety data to support the EUA include more than 4,600 participants (3,100 vaccine, 1,538 placebo) ages 5 through 11 years enrolled in the ongoing study. In this trial, a total of 1,444 vaccine recipients were followed for safety for at least 2 months after the second dose.  Commonly reported side effects in the clinical trial included injection site pain (sore arm), redness and swelling, fatigue, headache, muscle and/or joint pain, chills, fever, swollen lymph nodes, nausea and decreased appetite. More children reported side effects after the second dose than after the first dose. Side effects were generally mild to moderate in severity and occurred within two days after vaccination, and most went away within one to two days.  The FDA and CDC safety surveillance systems have previously identified increased risks of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of tissue surrounding the heart) following vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, particularly following the second dose, and with the observed risk highest in males 12 through 17 years of age. Therefore, the FDA conducted its own benefit-risk assessment using modelling to predict how many symptomatic COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths from COVID-19 the vaccine in children 5 through 11 years of age would prevent versus the number of potential myocarditis cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths that the vaccine might cause. The FDA’s model predicts that overall, the benefits of the vaccine would outweigh its risks in children 5 through 11 years of age.  Ongoing Safety Monitoring  Pfizer Inc. has updated its safety monitoring plan to include evaluation of myocarditis, pericarditis and other events of interest in children 5 through 11 years of age. In addition, the FDA and the CDC have several systems in place to continually monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety and allow for the rapid detection and investigation of potential safety problems.  It is mandatory for Pfizer Inc. and vaccination providers to report to any serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death in vaccinated individuals. It is also mandatory for vaccination providers to report all vaccine administration errors to VAERS for which they become aware and for Pfizer Inc. to include a summary and analysis of all identified vaccine administration errors in monthly safety reports to the FDA.  Data Supports New Vaccine Formulation to Improve Stability and Storage Conditions  The FDA today also authorized a manufacturing change for the vaccine to include a formulation that uses a different buffer; buffers help maintain a vaccine’s pH (a measure of how acidic or alkaline a solution is) and stability. This new formulation is more stable at refrigerated temperatures for longer periods of time, permitting greater flexibility for vaccination providers.  The new formulation of the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. contains Tris buffer, a commonly used buffer in a variety of other FDA-approved vaccines and other biologics, including products for use in children.

8695b2a9,"“The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm.” Hurricane Harvey looms off the coast of Texas, as seen from aboard the International Space Station. Every so often, the worst-case scenario comes to pass. As of Sunday afternoon, the remnants of Hurricane Harvey seem likely to exceed the worst forecasts that preceded the storm. The entire Houston metropolitan region is flooding: Interstates are under feet of water, local authorities have asked boat owners to join rescue efforts, and most of the streams and rivers near the city are in flood stage. Some models suggest that the storm will linger over the area until Wednesday night, dumping 50 inches of water in total on Houston and the surrounding area. “Local rainfall amounts of 50 inches would exceed any previous Texas rainfall record. The breadth and intensity of this rainfall are beyond anything experienced before,” said a statement from the National Weather Service. “Catastrophic flooding is now underway and expected to continue for several days.” (In years of weather reporting, I have never seen a statement this blunt and ominous.) This means that thousands of people—and perhaps tens of thousands of people—are facing a terrifying and all-too-real struggle to survive right now. In an age when the climate is changing rapidly, a natural question to ask is: What role did human-caused global warming play in strengthening this storm? Climate scientists, who specialize in thinking about the Earth system as a whole, are often reticent to link any one weather event to global climate change. But they say that aspects of the case of Hurricane Harvey—and the recent history of tropical cyclones worldwide—suggest global warming is making a bad situation worse. It may not be obvious why global warming has anything to do with hurricane strength. Climate change is caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. These gases prevent some of the sun’s rays from bouncing back into space, trapping heat in the planetary system and raising air temperatures all over the world. This warmer air causes evaporation to happen faster, which can lead to more moisture in the atmosphere. But that phenomenon alone does not explain climate change’s effects on Harvey. Storms like Harvey are helped by one of the consequences of climate change: As the air warms, some of that heat is absorbed by the ocean, which in turn raises the temperature of the sea’s upper layers. Harvey benefited from unusually toasty waters in the Gulf of Mexico. As the storm roared toward Houston last week, sea-surface waters near Texas rose to between 2.7 and 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit above average. These waters were some of the hottest spots of ocean surface in the world. The tropical storm, feeding off this unusual warmth, was able to progress from a tropical depression to a category-four hurricane in roughly 48 hours. “This is the main fuel for the storm,” says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research. “Although these storms occur naturally, the storm is apt to be more intense, maybe a bit bigger, longer-lasting, and with much heavier rainfalls [because of that ocean heat].” This also suggests an explanation for one of Harvey’s strangest and scariest behaviors. The storm intensified up until the moment of landfall, achieving category-four strength hours before it slammed into the Texas coast. This is not only rare for tropical cyclones in the western Gulf of Mexico: It may be unique. In the past 30 years of records, no storms west of Florida have intensified in the last 12 hours before landfall. Why do storms normally weaken—and why didn’t Harvey? As mentioned above, hurricanes feed and grow on warm ocean surface waters. But as they grow, their strong winds often pick up seawater, churning the oceans and moving the warmest waters deep below the surface. The same winds also bring newer, colder water closer to the atmosphere, which usually serves to drain energy and weaken the storm. That didn’t happen with Harvey. The hurricane churned up water 100 or even 200 meters below the surface, said Trenberth, but this water was still warm—meaning that the storm could keep growing and strengthening. “Harvey was not in a good position to intensify the way it did, because it was so close to land. It’s amazing it was able to do that,” he told me. All of this said, a storm like Harvey could have happened even if there was no climate change. Planning experts have long fretted over the possibility of a major hurricane striking Houston. Harvey is also a powerful hurricane forming in one of the most hurricane-friendly regions of the world at the peak of hurricane season. Storms similar to it would form in any climate. But Trenberth says that the extra heat could make the storm more costly and more powerful, overpowering and eventually breaking local drainage systems. “The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm,” he said. “It may have been a strong storm, and it may have caused a lot of problems anyway—but [human-caused climate change] amplifies the damage considerably.” More generally, it’s still unclear what effect climate change is having on hurricane formation across the greater Atlantic Ocean. A draft version of a major U.S. government review of climate science due out later this year says there is “medium confidence” that human activities “have contributed to the observed upward trend in North Atlantic hurricane activity since the 1970s.” Houston has been ground zero for super-damaging storms lately. It has seen four 100-year flooding events since the spring of 2015, according to the meteorologist Eric Holthaus. The city also sees 167 percent more heavy downpours than it did in the 1950s. Meanwhile, only one-sixth of its residents have federal flood insurance, though that program has struggled to adjust to the increased flooding risk associated with climate change. Yet even compared to recent storms, Harvey is unprecedented—just the kind of weird weather that scientists expect to see more of as the planet warms. Harvey has already dumped more water on Harris County than Tropical Storm Allison, the area’s previous worst-ever flooding disaster in 2001, though it has only lasted half the time of that earlier storm. And it will keep raining. As of Sunday afternoon, Buffalo Bayou, a major river near downtown Houston, is one foot above flood stage. It is projected to rise as much as another 12 feet today alone.",Did Climate Change Intensify Hurricane Harvey?,true,
0f461c45,"The number of people applying for UK university places has fallen by more than 25,000 4% on last year, data from the admissions service Ucas shows. The figures show a sharp decline in those applying to study nursing courses - down 19% - and a continued fall in the number of mature students, notably in England and Northern Ireland. The number of EU students planning to study in the UK has fallen by 5%. It is the first decline since fees were last increased in England, in 2012. Fees in England will increase to £9,250 this year, and student loans are subject to an increase in interest rates - rising from 4.6% to 6.1% from this autumn. University leaders said a number of factors could be fuelling the fall in applicants, including Brexit, higher fees and funding changes for trainee nurses and midwives. From 1 August, new nursing, midwifery and most allied health students in England will no longer receive NHS bursaries - instead, they will have access to the same student loans system as other students. Four nations The latest Ucas figures show the number of people who had applied to UK universities for the coming academic year by the 30 June deadline was 649,700 - compared with 674,890 in 2016. There have been reductions in applicants from all four countries in the UK. There were: 437,860 applications from students in England - down 5% from 459,430 last year 48,940 from Scotland - down 1% from 49,470 22,530 from Wales - down 5% from 23,740 20,290 from Northern Ireland - down 4% from 21,110 Applications from EU students fell from 51,850 in 2016 to 49,250 this year. However, applicants from overseas countries outside of the European Union are up 2%, from 69,300 in 2016 to 70,830 this year. There has been a significant drop in mature students those aged 25 and over in England and Northern Ireland - down 18% 11,190 and 13% 220 respectively. Dr Mark Corver, Ucas director of analysis and research, said: Within the figures, there are contrasting trends. How these trends translate into students at university and colleges will become clear over the next six weeks, as applicants get their results and secure their places and new applicants apply direct to Ucas's clearing process. Mature students Prof Les Ebdon, director of Fair Access to Higher Education, said: The downward trend in mature student numbers is now one of the most pressing issues in fair access to higher education. Undoubtedly, the reasons behind the fall are complex and multiple, but universities and colleges should look to do what they can to reverse the decline in mature student applications, as a matter of urgency. studentsimage copyrightGetty Images Dame Julia Goodfellow, president of Universities UK, said universities recognised that there were a number of issues to address. Continuing to communicate to European applicants that they are welcome and enrich our education system is important, she said. The decline in part-time and mature student entrants must also be addressed. We recognise also the concern about the total cost of going to university. Any analysis needs to cover the cost of maintenance and the interest rate on the loans. Sarah Stevens, head of policy at the Russell Group, said it would be a concern if EU students were being put off by the uncertainties of Brexit. It's positive that applications from overseas students outside the EU have risen slightly, he said. International students bring social and cultural diversity to our campuses and this benefits all students, and they contribute £25.8bn to the UK economy. The Department for Education pointed out that the number of 18-year-olds applying for university was at record levels despite the fall in the overall number of applicants. A spokeswoman said: Higher education reforms will give people more choice and universities will be expected to continue improving access and participation in higher education. The government is committed to supporting all young people to reach their full potential - whether that is going to university, starting an apprenticeship or taking up a technical qualification. Pam Tatlow, chief executive of MillionPlus, said the application data from Ucas was not good news. As predicted, the abolition of bursaries has depressed rather than increased applications for nursing and there will be no additional nurses trained in spite of ministers' assurances, she said. There is no doubt that the government's approach to Brexit is damaging and is creating huge uncertainties, both for EU students and UK universities.",On the Capitol: Part-time pay for part-time Legislature?,true,
08294d0a,"Nearly 40,000 Wisconsinites would lose benefits under proposed Trump administration food stamp rule MADISON - Nearly 40,000 Wisconsinites would lose food benefits under a rule change President Donald Trump’s administration is pursuing. The change would boost costs for Wisconsin taxpayers by millions of dollars a year because the state would have to upgrade the computer systems that administer the FoodShare program, retrain workers and more thoroughly scrutinize the assets of people who apply for benefits. The computer upgrade would cost $2.3 million, according to the state Department of Health Services. Operational costs would rise by $17.7 million a year. State and local taxpayers would have to pick up about half of both sets of costs, with the federal government paying for the rest. “The bottom line is you’d have more cost on bureaucracy and administration and fewer benefits going to Wisconsinites,” Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul said. Kaul and 23 other attorneys general sent a letter last week urging the U.S. Department of Agriculture not to implement the new rule for the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, which is widely known as the food stamp program. In Wisconsin, it is called FoodShare. Other Wisconsin Democrats, including Gov. Tony Evers and U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, are fighting the proposed rule. But U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, a Republican from Glenbeulah, argued the new rule would help ensure only the deserving receive benefits. “A lot of people didn’t know that millionaires are eligible for food stamps,” he said. “I’m glad Donald Trump came along and decided to put a stop to it.” Nearly 40 million people, including about 644,000 Wisconsinites, received food stamps in 2018. Like most states, Wisconsin provides food benefits to people who qualify for other government programs without performing additional income and asset tests. The proposed rule would bar people in other programs from automatically qualifying for food stamps. Reviews of their income and assets would need to be conducted to ensure that, in most cases, their income is at or below 130% of the federal poverty level and they do not have liquid assets worth more than $2,250. For a family of three, 130% of the federal poverty level is about $2,250 a month. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said the proposed rule is meant to prevent wealthy people from qualifying for food stamps. He cited the example of Rob Undersander, a Minnesota man who conducted what he called a citizen’s audit of the food stamp program. Undersander told Minnesota lawmakers last year he received about $300 a month in food stamps for 19 months despite having more than $1 million in property and retirement accounts, according to WCCO-TV and Forum News Service. He was able to qualify for those benefits because he had little income. “What we’re trying to do is make it fair and equal across everyone, where everyone who qualifies for food stamps based on the rules that Congress has passed, both asset and income tests, can qualify just as they always have,” Perdue told reporters Tuesday at the World Dairy Expo in Madison. “Those people who become categorically eligible, as in that fellow from Minnesota who tested the system as a millionaire and qualified for food stamps, we don’t want that happening.” But Kaul said the proposed rule would primarily hurt people who are struggling. “The majority of people who are going to be affected are children and seniors,"" the attorney general said. ""Undermining food security for children and seniors ... is cruel.” Nearly 3 million food stamp recipients across the country would lose their benefits if the rule change went into effect, according to estimates by Perdue’s Department of Agriculture. The rule would also result in children losing access to school lunches because many schools automatically provide free meals to children if they receive food stamps. In Wisconsin, about 39,600 people in about 24,100 households would lose more than $11 million in benefits a year, according to estimates from the state Department of Health Services. Of those, about 13,000 are children and about 11,000 are senior citizens. To accommodate the rule change, the state would have to spend $2.3 million modifying its computer systems and retraining those who use it, according to the state. State taxpayers would have to cover half that cost, with the federal government picking up the other half. In addition, the cost of operating the program would increase by $17.7 million a year for Wisconsin. That’s because of additional training, longer application processing time and more review of applicants' assets, according to the department. About half the higher annual costs would fall to local and state taxpayers, with the rest paid by the federal government, according to the state Department of Health Services. Administrative costs are shared by the federal government and the states. The federal government covers the cost of the benefits, which totaled nearly $65 billion nationally in 2018, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Department of Agriculture took public comments on the proposed rule change through last week. It hasn’t set a date for deciding whether to advance the rule. “We shouldn’t be making it harder for struggling Americans to make ends meet and put food on the table — which is what this proposed regulation would do,” Evers and Democratic governors from 16 other states wrote in a letter to the Agriculture Department.

Now a Public Health England report confirms that infections increase during the fortnight after vaccination. British Government Study Confirms Covid-19 Vaccine Risk: Infections INCREASE in Fortnight after Jab Anyone raising concern about the safety of Covid-19 vaccines faces derision as an ‘anti-vaxxer’, but the real extremists are those who refuse to hear evidence that something is going badly wrong with this mass experimental encroachment on the sanctity of the body. Now a Public Health England report confirms that infections increase during the fortnight after vaccination. Advertisement - story continues below As the vaccination programme began in earnest in January, worrying signs came from care homes, where many of the initial target population of people aged over 80 reside. At Pemberley House in Basingstoke, England, a third of the residents died of Covid-19. The death toll of 24 was unusual in a home that had previously been free from the disease. Similar reports emerged from Germany. The clearest indications came from small countries that strove to vaccinate their entire adult population. The British enclave of Gibraltar was supplied with the Pfizer vaccine on 16th January and the elderly were swiftly jabbed. Suddenly this tiny state, home to 33 thousand, had the worst Covid-19 morality in the world (2761 per million). From merely 9 deaths in December, now almost a hundred have died. The health minister angrily denied claims that the vaccine was killing people, but eventually admitted that some deaths had occurred soon after the jab. The United Arab Emirates received large batches of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine as well as the Pfizer product in December. As stated by Amer Sharif, head of the Covid-19 Command & Control Centre in Dubai, the UAE aimed to be the first country in the world to achieve 100% vaccination of eligible adults. An increase in deaths was attributed to mutant strains, but as in other countries the rate rose disproportionately in the vaccinated age band. On 10th February a new daily high of 18 deaths from the coronavirus was recorded, and the trend has continued. Considerably more people are dying than in the first wave last spring. More evidence of iatrogenic harm came from Israel, which started vaccinating on 19th December. As reported by former New York Times journalist Alex Berenson, while Covid-19 mortality escalated among Israelis throughout January, in Palestine it declined steeply after a surge in December. Yet the Palestinians had no vaccine. This correlation is more than coincidental. Analysis of Israeli health ministry data by Hervé Seligmann at Aix-Marseilles University indicates that about 40 times more elderly people died of Covid-19 in the three weeks between their first and second doses than among those who were not vaccinated. Sacrificial lambs? Deaths in Israel are now falling, which politicians and media attribute to the vaccine, although there is a global trend of the virus becoming less deadly. It should not be unexpected that Covid-19 vaccines have deleterious as well as intended effects. Pfizer data shows significant lymphocyte depletion in the first week after vaccination. June Raine, chief of the UK medicines regulator MHRA, acknowledged that ‘a week or two’ is needed to build up immunity after the first jab. The Public Health England study, which was hailed by health secretary Matt Hancock for the reported 80% decrease in hospitalisations, actually showed a 48% rise in infections after the first dose of Pfizer and Astra Zeneca vaccines. The authors, however, blamed this on a higher risk of exposure. Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at PHE, stated that ‘this adds to growing evidence that the vaccines are working to reduce infections and save lives’. She glossed over the hundreds who died after getting the jab. This is what may be happening. Vulnerable people who unknowingly had Covid-19 or whose immune system was keeping it at bay, succumbed to the disease after the vaccine lowered their immunity. The virus struck hard, leading to sever symptoms, cytokine storm and pneumonia. It is also possible that previously shielding persons were cross-infected by the vaccinators. This needs proper scrutiny, not reckless denial by those who are meant to protect us. This defensiveness and censorship is how the thalidomide scandal arose. The authorities have apparently cast aside everything we have learned about ethical safeguards in clinical and experimental treatment. Perhaps it is relevant that the British medicine regulator is heavily funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Why aren’t doctors raising the alert? In medical training, hardly a day is given to learning about vaccines, and Big Pharma has undue influence on this noble profession. With critical thinking and dissent stifled by the Covid regime, most doctors are mere conformists. We must appeal to the brave few medics to continue their efforts to expose the deadly hazard of this highly dubious intervention.Why aren’t doctors raising the alert?

6600699c,"Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, will today pledge to introduce an additional mandated health visit at 3-4 months, as part of Labour’s commitment to making Britain’s children the healthiest in the world. Experts say that 3-4 months is when mothers are at substantial risk of perinatal mental health problems, and is a critical time in supporting continued breastfeeding. Labour will commit an additional £25 million for health visiting to fund the pledge, paid for from Labour’s costed National Child Health Fund, announced in the General election. Child health outcomes in Britain are lagging behind most other high-income countries on obesity rates, tooth decay and mortality. Today’s pledge forms part of Labour’s all-out effort to tackle health inequalities and improve early intervention services. Jonathan Ashworth will also unveil new analysis showing that since the end of the national Health Visitor Programme in 2015, staffing numbers and funding have tailed off: Between 2016/17 and 2017/18, local authorities will have £55.2 million in real terms cut from their public health 0-5 children’s services, which primarily cover universal health visitor reviews, because of public health cuts imposed by this Tory Government. There were 8,244 full time equivalent health visitors working in the NHS as of December 2017, which is the lowest number since August 2013. Numbers peaked at 10,309 in October 2015, meaning there has been a fall of more than 2,065 health visitors or 20% in just over two years The impact of cuts to health visitor numbers is now leading to huge variations in outcomes for children across the country: Nationally, 12% of babies missed out on a New Birth Visit in the most recent period, but performance was mixed- rising to 17% in the South West of England. Nationally, 17% of babies missed out on their 6-8 week review- although in London this was a 1/3 rd of babies. of babies. Nationally, over 25% of children did not receive their mandated one year review by 12 months- in London this was a staggering 44% of children. 90% of North East babies received a two and a half year check, compared to just 64% in London and 73% in the East of England. Additionally, Jonathan Ashworth will today: Pledge to reinstate the Infant Feeding Survey- first established by a Labour Government and then abandoned by the Coalition Government. Pledge to work towards ensuring all maternity services achieve and maintain UNICEF’s UK Baby Friendly Initiative accreditation- as already occurs in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and is recommended by NICE as a minimum standard. Pledge support for the ‘70/30 campaign’, which aims to bring about a 70% reduction in child maltreatment by the year 2030. Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, speaking to the national ‘Breastfeeding: a public health priority’ conference in London, will say: “Sir Michael Marmot taught us: “The foundations for virtually every aspect of human development – physical, intellectual and emotional – are laid in early childhood.” “Yet after many years of progress, health outcomes for babies and young children in the UK are stalling. We are lagging behind most other high-income countries on mortality, breastfeeding and obesity rates. “So I want to use the opportunity of its 70th anniversary to reflect on the next stage of the NHS’s development. And I strongly believe a laser like focus on improving the health and wellbeing of every child must be an absolute priority. “The future of health visiting services is at a critical juncture. David Cameron and Theresa May used to boast of their commitment to increase the number of health visitors. Yet we have actually seen health visitors cut by more than 20 percent in just over two years. “We must do better in England where families generally receive the lowest level of universal health visiting support when compared to the other UK nations, both in numbers and quality of universal contacts received. “As Health Secretary it will be my commitment to work with Health Visitors to implement an additional mandated health visit at 3-4 months backed up by an extra £25 million of investment from our National Child Health Fund. “Children are 20 per cent of our population but 100 per cent of our future.

dc22ab9d,"A single mother has told the BBC she fears losing her home, on the day the new benefits cap is introduced. Emma Bradley, who has four children, including a baby, said she could be left £76 a week short on her rent unless she finds work. The cap - which limits the income households receive in certain benefits - has been reduced from £26,000 a year to £20,000 a year outside London. The government says the cap is a clear incentive to move into a job. But the policy has been criticised by campaigners and unions. The GMB union described the lower cap as a monstrous new assault on 40,000 single mothers, which risks shattering the life chances of children up and down our country. Under the new system, Ms Bradley's benefits will be capped unless she works at least 16 hours a week. Speaking to BBC Breakfast on the day the new system was introduced, the mother-of-four from Coventry said she would quite happily work, but the childcare costs and the job of looking after her four children made it much harder to do so. She said she was having sleepless nights worrying about how she would find a job to fit around her family, saying: If I lose the house, which could happen, it is scary to think 'what would I do?'. 'Incentive' to find work The earliest free childcare provision is offered is when a child is aged two. The Gingerbread group, which campaigns for single parents, said 43,700 single parents with a child under the age of five would be hit by the cap. The new benefit cap is likely to drive more single parents into poverty. Many will have to choose between the roof over their children's heads and other essentials such as food and heating, said Gingerbread policy officer Laura Dewar. But ministers say the level of the cap is fair because it is close to the average salary after tax. The Department for Work and Pensions described it as a clear incentive to move into a job. The current Work and Pensions Secretary, Damian Green, said it was wrong that some claimants could receive more in benefits than the average wage. He said the government was making it as easy as possible for claimants to get work, by offering free childcare offers and structuring benefits to encourage people in to employment. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he denied that children of single parents who do not work were being condemned by the changes. I'm not saying that lone parents have to go and find a full-time job. If they want to avoid the benefit cap they only have to be working 16 hours a week and we will be providing free childcare to enable them to do that, he said. Two children holding an adult's handimage copyrightGetty Images image captionSome 320,000 children will be affected be the changes, analysis suggests The cap - which, in total, is now set to affect an estimated 88,000 households primarily with high rents or large families - relates to a string of benefits for those aged 16 to 64 including child tax credit, housing benefit, jobseeker's allowance and income support, but excludes some others such as disability living allowance. Households where someone works more than 16 hours a week are exempt. Under the new cap, those living in the UK outside of Greater London will receive a maximum of: £384.62 per week £20,000 a year for a couple £384.62 per week £20,000 a year for single people whose children live with them £257.69 per week £13,400 a year for single people who do not have children or whose children do not live with them The limits are higher for those living in Greater London boroughs. The new cap is: £442.31 per week £23,000 a year for a couple £442.31 per week £23,000 a year for single people whose children live with them £296.35 per week £15,410 a year for single people who do not have children or whose children do not live with them Those affected will most likely see their housing benefit amount being cut, but the changes are expected to take a few weeks to be fully implemented. Research by the Chartered Institute of Housing suggests 320,000 children will be affected estimating 115,000 households are impacted with families losing up to £100 a week. The cap will save the Treasury an estimated £100m a year in the long run, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies IFS - only a fraction of the total £12bn cuts to welfare spending over this parliament. But the IFS questioned whether the policy would actually have the desired effect. The lower cap would fail to move the majority of those affected into work or prompt them to downsize their home, it said. Speaking to the BBC shortly after resigning as work and pensions secretary in March, Iain Duncan Smith hit out at the arbitrary decision to lower the welfare cap. He questioned why working-age benefits were hit while pensioner benefits were protected. 'Route out of poverty' A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: We are committed to helping lone parents into a job which fits in around their caring responsibilities, which is why we are doubling the amount of free childcare available. We know that work is the best route out of poverty, and there are now record numbers of lone parents in work. The benefit cap provides a clear incentive to move into a job, even if it is part time, as anyone eligible for working tax credits is exempt. Even with the new cap, lone parents can still receive benefits up to the equivalent salary of £25,000, or £29,000 in London. Some discretionary funds are available for people struggling to pay their rent.","Historical Data destroys the Global Warming myth, and people are waking to it…",true,
1632dc3f,"Posted: February 10, 2020 by Last updated: New online scams have preyed on the public's fear about coronavirus outbreak. Don't be fooled. Here is what we know about coronavirus and its related scams. UPDATE 03/05/2020: Yesterday, our malware intelligence researchers found a clever ploy to hide an info-stealer behind a website that purported to show updated coronavirus cases on a global map. Malwarebytes initially detected the malware, which carried the ominous and maybe-too-obvious filename “corona.exe”, as Trojan.Corona. Upon further analysis, we learned that this malware was actually a variant of AzorUlt, a family of spyware that steals information and sometimes downloads additional malware. We have now updated the detection name to Spyware.AzorUlt. Unlike similar coronavirus scams we discovered last month, this threat does not rely on an email campaign. Original story below. Panic and confusion about the recent coronavirus outbreak spurred threat actors to launch several malware campaigns across the world, relying on a tried-and-true method to infect people’s machines: fear. Cybercriminals targeted users in Japan with an Emotet campaign that included malicious Word documents that allegedly contained information about coronavirus prevention. Malware embedded into PDFs, MP4s, and Docx files circulated online, bearing titles that alluded to protection tips. Phishing emails that allegedly came from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were spotted, too. Malwarebytes also found a novel scam purporting to direct users to a donation page to help support government and medical research. All of these threats rely on the same dangerous intersection of misinformation and panic—a classic and grotesque cybercrime tactic. A great defense to these is, quite simply, the truth. At Malwarebytes, we understand that safeguarding you from cyberthreats goes beyond technological protection. It also means giving you the information you need to make smart, safe decisions. Because of this, we’re presenting verified resources and data about coronavirus that will hopefully steer users away from online threats. If you see a sketchy-looking email mentioning the virus (like the one we found below), don’t open it. Instead, come here. If you want to immediately see what these online scams look like, scroll below. What is coronavirus? According to the World Health Organization, the current coronavirus that has infected thousands of people across the world is a single variant of a broader family of viruses, also called “coronavirus.” This particular strain of coronavirus was first identified in the city of Wuhan in central China’s Hubei province. It has the title “2019-nCoV.” Though 2019-nCoV is from the same family of coronaviruses as SARS—which spread to 26 countries between 2002 and 2003—it is not the same virus. As of February 7, coronavirus has spread to at least 25 countries, including Australia, Vietnam, the United States, the Philippines, Nepal, Sweden, the United Kingdom, India, and more. Mexico has no reported cases—the only country in North America to avoid the virus, it appears. Countries in South America, including Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, and Chile, have not reported any confirmed cases of the virus, either. While the majority of infections are reported in China, with 31,211 confirmed cases, the highest count of any other country is Singapore, with 30 cases. Full, daily reports on the virus’ spread can be found at the World Health Organization’s resource page here: Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) situation reports. The situation reports also provide information about every country with confirmed coronavirus cases, and this Al Jazeera article compiles that information up to February 6. According to a February 6 report in The Wall Street Journal that cites scientists and medical academics in China, the recent coronavirus likely started in bats. According to the US Center for Disease Control, coronavirus symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. How can I protect myself from coronavirus? Because coronavirus spreads from human-to-human contact, the best protection methods involve good hygiene. According to the WHO, individuals should: Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand rub if your hands are not visibly dirty. Maintain social distancing—maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and other people, particularly those who are coughing, sneezing and have a fever. Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth. If you have fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Tell your health care provider if you have travelled in an area in China where 2019-nCoV has been reported, or if you have been in close contact with someone with who has travelled from China and has respiratory symptoms. If you have mild respiratory symptoms and no travel history to or within China, carefully practice basic respiratory and hand hygiene and stay home until you are recovered, if possible. The WHO also actively dispelled some current myths about coronavirus. For instance, individuals cannot catch the virus from dogs and cats that are their pets, and vaccines against pneumonia do not protect against coronavirus. For more information on coronavirus myths, please visit the WHO Myth Busters page here, along with the WHO Q&A page. What else should I know about coronavirus? Coronavirus is a serious threat, but it is not the world-ending plague that many fear. As of February 7, the virus has resulted in 637 total deaths. A February 6 notice by the Chinese media service CGTN reported more recoveries, at 1,542. Individuals should not fear receiving packages from China, the WHO said, as the virus cannot survive long durations on physical objects like packages and letters. Similarly, individuals should not dip into unmeasured fear of all things Chinese. These fears have turned New York’s Chinatown district into a “ghost town,” said one local business owner, and have fueled multiple xenophobic and racist assumptions across the world. The WHO says it is okay to receive packages delivered from China. Coronavirus has also received a strong global response. Air travel has been severely limited, Olympic qualifying games were relocated, workers built a hospital in about 10 days, fast food restaurants temporarily closed their locations, and China closed off entire populations—which has come with its own tragic tales of quarantine camps, isolation, and fear. The spread of the virus is scary, yes, but people are working day and night to prevent greater exposure. What should I know about coronavirus scams? Coronavirus online scams are largely similar to one another. By preying on misinformation and fear, cybercriminals hope to trick unwitting individuals into opening files and documents that promise information about the virus. However, Malwarebytes recently found an email scam that preys on people’s desire to help during a moment like this. The scam email—titled “URGENT: Coronavirus, Can we count on your support today?”—purportedly comes from the nondescript “Department of Health.” Inside, the email asks users to donate to coronavirus prevention causes. “We need your support , Would you consider donating 100 HKD to help us achieve our mission?” the email says near its end, before offering a disguised link that opens an application, not a website. The link itself begins with neither HTTPS or HTTP, but “HXXP.” A screenshot of an emailed coronavirus scam that preys on users’ good will. Routine scams that allegedly include information about prevention and protection also come through emails, like this phishing scam spotted by Sophos. A screenshot of the emailed coronavirus scam that Sophos discovered. The malicious email informs its recipient to open an attached document that includes information about “safety measures regarding the spreading of coronavirus,” which then directs users to a page that asks for their email address and password. These scams are becoming a dime a dozen, and we don’t expect them to dwindle any time soon. In fact, threat actors in China were spotted sending malware around through email and through the Chinese social media platform WeChat. Though the exact types of malware were not reported, the Computer Virus Emergency Response Center said the malware itself could be used to steal data or remotely control victims’ devices.

9dd3f5d4,"Get ready for another big rise in train fares. This Wednesday we’ll see the publication of the latest retail prices index RPI. The Office for National Statistics thinks it is such a poor indicator of prices that it now designates it as “Not a National Statistic.” Yet this non-statistic, which is nearly always significantly higher than the CPI consumer prices index is nonetheless used as the official basis for raising train fares. And all the signs are that the squeeze on commuters is only going to get worse.  The cost of season tickets for commuters goes up in January, but the rise is dictated by the level of RPI the previous July, a figure usually published in mid-August. When the July figure for RPI is released this Wednesday, it will be at least 3.4% its current level but more likely 3.5% or even 3.6%, as petrol prices and home energy bill increases feed into the index. So with grim inevitability train fares will, yet again, rise faster than wages.  If rail fares were to go up in line with CPI, we could expect a rise of 2.4% next January. If they went up in line with wages, we’d expect a 2.5% increase. But the RPI formula means they regularly go up faster than wages. This time last year the RPI was 3.6%, enabling the rail companies to shove through big price increases on commuter routes at a time when wage growth was stalling.  What does a 3.5% rise mean in practice? For commuters from Cambridge into London terminals’ such as King’s Cross, the annual season ticket at the beginning of 2019 will smash through the £5,000 level, jumping from £4,952 to £5,125.  It’s worth noting that in Germany, Deutsche Bahn offers the BahnCard 100 that lets you board any train anywhere in the country for a year for €4,270 £3,840. In Britain we expect commuters to pay £1,263 more than that just for a 48-mile commuter journey from Cambridgeshire into the capital.  Meanwhile, a 3.5% rise will see the annual season ticket from Tunbridge Wells into London terminals jump from £4,644 to £4,806, while Reading to London will go from £4,464 to £4,620. Rochdale to Manchester will cost £1,196 instead of £1,156. And spare a thought for the miserable passengers on Britain’s officially most overcrowded route, the early morning train from Uckfield in Sussex to London Bridge, which on average is 250% full. They can expect to fork out another £105 on top of the £3,000 they are currently paying for an annual season ticket.  As the chancellor, Philip Hammond, prepares his autumn budget, he might want to listen to the Campaign for Better Transport: “We want the government to commit to a fares freeze and hold regulated rail fares at their current level. The government has frozen fuel duty for the last seven years and we think rail passengers should be given the same treatment. Given the mess surrounding the new timetable, the lack of improvements and the failure to deliver compensation, the government cannot go on telling passengers that fare increases are justified.”  Our train companies this week said they are trying to clean up ticketing. The Rail Delivery Group is getting rid of language such as “route direct”, “any permitted” and “London terminals” to simplify the system. It even proclaims there has already been an 11% improvement in the number of people buying the wrong ticket at a vending machine. But it remains absolutely astonishing that one in 10 ticket buyers still purchase the wrong ticket – usually leaving the traveller out of pocket, not the rail company – because we have such an absurdly complicated fares structure.  Have you worked at several different employers, with bits of pensions here and there, with statements perhaps going to previous addresses where you lived at the time? Not really sure if you have contributed enough national insurance for the full state pension?

Sadly, the DWP, bogged down in the roll out of universal credit, is back-pedalling fast, and the dashboard may now never surface.  Ditching it will be a huge mistake. An online petition at 38 Degrees to save it has already attracted more than 130,000 signatures.

,"(CNN) Yet another ballot audit is set to move ahead in Georgia's most populous county after a judge ruled Friday that absentee ballots could be unsealed for parties looking to examine them for evidence of fraud.  The review of Fulton County's absentee ballots, which is not set to begin until the judge reviews the terms of the audit, comes as conservatives have clamored for election audits in a number of states in the wake of former President Donald Trump's November loss. The baseless belief that there was widespread fraud has persisted among some Republicans, despite the lack of evidence.  While the Fulton County case paves the way for yet another ballot audit, it will not lead to Georgia's election results -- which have already been certified for President Joe Biden -- being overturned.  The decision in Georgia comes after a handful of plaintiffs filed a lawsuit to access the ballots. But the audit in Fulton County is likely to come with more stipulations than the opaquely operated, GOP-run audit playing out in Arizona's Maricopa County.  While Henry County Judge Brian Amero ordered that the ballots be unsealed, ""Petitioners shall only be permitted to inspect and scan said ballots in accordance with protocols and practices that will be set forth by further order of the Court,"" according to court documents . The judge directed counsel for the parties to convene where the ballots are being stored next week.  Garland Favorito, one of the plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit and the co-founder of Voters Organized for Trusted Election Results in Georgia, said he and his counterparts are formulating a plan to scan and forensically analyze the Fulton County mail-in ballots. He said they will submit that plan to the judge before May 28.  Favorito told CNN that he hopes roughly half a dozen experts will have a chance to evaluate the newly scanned ballot images and search for characteristics that could determine whether any ballots are counterfeit.  ""The reason that we want to do it is to determine whether or not there are counterfeit ballots,"" Favorito said.  Fulton County Chairman Robb Pitts, a Democrat, slammed the push for yet another review of the 2020 election.  ""It is outrageous that Fulton County continues to be a target of those who cannot accept the results from last year's election,"" Pitts said. ""The votes have been counted three times, including a hand recount, and no evidence of fraud has been found. The fact remains that Fulton County safely and securely carried out an election in the midst of a public health pandemic. It's a shame to see that the 'Big Lie' lives on and could cost the hardworking taxpayers of this county.""  He dismissed concerns about counterfeit ballots as little more than a conservative pipe dream.  ""This conspiracy theory about counterfeit ballots has been trotted out by proponents of the 'Big Lie' across the country and shot down every time,"" Pitts said. ""Whether it's looking for bamboo in Arizona's ballots or searching for counterfeits in Fulton's, it is nonsense.""  Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican who has come under fire from many members of his own party after standing up to Trump's attempts to overturn the election, offered a more sanguine response to the judge's ruling.  ""From day one I have encouraged Georgians with legitimate concerns about the election in their counties to pursue those claims through legal avenues,"" Raffensperger said in a statement. ""Fulton County has a longstanding history of election mismanagement that has understandably weakened voters' faith in its system. Allowing this audit provides another layer of transparency and citizen engagement.""  The Georgia Secretary of State's office also noted that Georgia counties have already undergone hand audits and re-scanned each ballot after the Trump campaign requested a recount. Those reviews upheld the original election result showing Biden won the state -- the first Democrat to do so since 1992.  Other conservatives, including former Sen. Kelly Loeffler, cheered the judge's decision.  ""Voter confidence in our election system is the bedrock of our republic,"" she said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, inconsistencies in Fulton County's November 2020 absentee ballots cast serious doubt on voters' faith in our elections.""  But the audit will not change the results of the election.  ""It's not an election challenge and therefore this case alone could not do that,"" Favorito said. ""What this case is about is the equal protection and due process, constitutional rights, of the plaintiffs and all Georgia voters. Because if counterfeit ballots were introduced into the certified results, it diluted our votes and the votes of all Georgians both within and outside of Fulton County.""  CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the number of experts Garland Favorito wants to examine images of mail-in ballots from Fulton County, Georgia. He said he wanted about half a dozen experts to evaluate the images.","Another ballot audit set to move ahead in Fulton County, Georgia, as judge rules absentee ballots can be unsealed",true,90396961368290957609462884369729058138

This is incorrect as only county officials in Allegheny are being sued. In addition, the headline states that they are accused of registering over 1,500 deceased people. This is also incorrect as they weren’t personally responsible for registering the dead people on the active voter list.

It’s an issue that extends far and wide, too; it isn’t only limited to certain areas.  For instance, it seems another major voting snafu has popped up in a Pennsylvania county … where it seems ghosts can participate in elections.  That’s right – a LOT of dead individuals are actually registered to vote!  As a result, a lawsuit has been filed against the county for its failure to clean up their voter rolls.  Maybe this legal action is just what we need to clean things up!  From Breitbart:  A lawsuit filed against Allegheny County, Pennsylvania alleges that nearly 1,600 dead people are registered to vote in the 2020 election in the county.  Nearly 1,600 people – who have long since passed on – are still on the voter rolls. How ridiculous is that?  The Public Interest Legal Foundation filed the suit, and found that 1,583 deceased registrants remain active voters.  Come on. Seriously? They can’t even keep voter lists updated?  Did you know that nearly 50 of those people have birth dates in the 1800s?! I mean, that’s just pathetic.  But wait, there’s more…  In addition, the lawsuit also claims that nearly 7,500 voter registrations are duplicates!  In one extreme case, the person registered to vote SEVEN TIMES in on day while out of state.  This is just plain unacceptable.

629bd28a,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - After narrowly winning an Aug. 7 special election for a Columbus-area congressional seat, newly minted GOP Rep. Troy Balderson of Zanesville is badly losing the fundraising battle in his November rematch with Democratic Franklin County Recorder Danny O'Connor, Federal Election Commission filings show.  Reports that covered the pair's campaign fundraising from July 19 through Aug. 27 showed O'Connor had more than $1 million in the bank at the end of August, compared with under $93,000 for Balderson.  O'Connor took in almost $4 million during the period covered by the report, including more than $1.4 million he got after losing the election by 1,680 votes. Balderson raised slightly more than $500,000. Roughly $180,000 of the cash Balderson raised came from political action committees.  O'Connor's campaign said he got donations from more than 92,000 people in the period covered by the report, most of whom gave small amounts of money. Most donors listed in his report were from outside of Ohio.  We have thousands of people chipping in $5 and $10 at a time, said O'Connor's campaign manager Annie  Ellison  . They are excited about Danny's campaign for new leadership. And we are really proud of that.  Balderson's campaign had a different take on O'Connor's haul.  Liberal out of state special interest groups are continuing to prop up Danny O'Connor's campaign in their efforts to retake the House and put Nancy Pelosi in the Speaker's chair, said a statement Balderson released through his campaign before his own report was filed. While O'Connor's campaign has raised 90% of his campaign funds from liberal out of staters, our campaign is funded by hard-working Ohioans who want someone who will fight for them and their middle class values.  O'Connor's campaign got more than $114,000 from political action committees, including $5,000 each from organizations associated with autoworkers, boilermakers and firefighters unions. He also got a $5,000 donation from a committee associated with New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker and $2,000 from Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign committee.  The political committees that contributed to Balderson included Donald Trump's presidential campaign, which gave $2,000, and political committees associated with aspiring House of Representatives speakers Kevin McCarthy of California, who gave $4,000, and Jim Jordan of Champaign County, who gave $2,000. Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman's political committee gave $5,000 to Balderson, as did political action committees for Koch Industries, Murray Energy, and Cardinal Health.  O'Connor's campaign said Balderson's report demonstrated he's beholden to corporations and party bosses.  We're proud of the grassroots support behind Danny's campaign for new leadership because people are ready for someone who isn't beholden to any corporation or party boss, that's why he didn't take a single dime of corporate PAC money and 92% of contributions were for $50 or less, Ellison said. Central Ohioans get excited for new leadership when they hear from Danny, and with this grassroots army we'll have the resources to communicate his message.  O'Connor's biggest expenses were more than $2.6.million spent on media production and buys, and digital services. He felt financially secure enough to give a $25,000 contribution to the Ohio Democratic Party on Aug. 10.  Balderson's campaign spent more than $400,000 on media buys and more than $42,000 on fundraising services. He also paid the Republican National Committee $25,000 for a campaign event.  Records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics indicated that outside groups spent more than $5 million so far to back Balderson and oppose O'Connor, while groups sympathetic to O'Connor have spent around $1.3 million.  My record of balancing budgets, cutting taxes, and delivering results are what Ohioans are looking for in a Congressman, as evidenced by my victory in the August special election, said a statement from Balderson. We will have the necessary resources to deliver that message and defend against any attacks from the O'Connor-Pelosi team.",Danny O'Connor has more than 10 times Troy Balderson's money going into November rematch,mixture,

But families do not all experience inflation in the same way, official figures only tell part of the story.  Low-income people are always most affected by rises because, if you are only just making ends meet and your costs rise, there is no spending to cut back without affecting your living standards.  The poorest households spend three times as much on gas and electricity bills as the richest and those bills are expected to rise sharply in April.

Jack Monroe, the food writer, has started a campaign for statistics to better represent the rising cost of food for the poorest. But we currently don’t have good data on how low-income families are experiencing food price inflation.  Regardless, we do know that the decision of turning on the heating or putting food on the table – something that many take for granted – is becoming a source of financial stress.

Noah also requires 2,900 calories a day, meaning their food bill is “through the roof”, and they receive very little financial support.  Shelley, from Chepstow, South-East Wales, said: “Because of the changing tariffs I had a bill for seven weeks which was £165 and instead was £376 for electricity.  “It’s not just that.

9d0cdfe6,"Share this Story: Polar bears keep thriving even as global warming alarmists keep pretending they’re dying  Polar bears keep thriving even as global warming alarmists keep pretending they’re dying Susan Crockford: Polar bears are flourishing, making them phony icons, and false idols, for global warming alarmists Photo by Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press  Article content One powerful polar bear fact is slowly rising above the message of looming catastrophe repeated endlessly by the media: More than 15,000 polar bears have not disappeared since 2005. Although the extent of the summer sea ice after 2006 dropped abruptly to levels not expected until 2050, the predicted 67-per-cent decline in polar bear numbers simply didn’t happen. Rather, global polar bear numbers have been stable or slightly improved. The polar bear’s resilience should have meant the end of its use as a cherished icon of global warming doom, but it didn’t. The alarmism is not going away without a struggle. Part of this struggle involves a scientific clash about transparency in polar bear science. My close examination of recent research has revealed that serious inconsistencies exist within the polar bear literature and between that literature and public statements made by some researchers. For example, Canadian polar bear biologist Ian Stirling learned in the 1970s that spring sea ice in the southern Beaufort Sea periodically gets so thick that seals depart, depriving local polar bears of their prey and causing their numbers to plummet. But that fact, documented in more than a dozen scientific papers, is not discussed today as part of polar bear ecology. In these days of politicized science, neither Stirling nor his colleagues mention in public the devastating effects of thick spring ice in the Beaufort Sea; instead, they imply in recent papers that the starving bears they witnessed are victims of reduced summer sea ice, which they argued depleted the bears’ prey. There are also strong indications that thick spring-ice conditions happened again in 2014–16, with the impacts on polar bears being similarly portrayed as effects of global warming.

Try refreshing your browser, or Polar bears keep thriving even as global warming alarmists keep pretending they’re dying Back to video  Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.  Article content The polar bear's resilience should have meant the end of its use as an icon of global warming doom One reason that the 2007 predictions of future polar bear survival were so far off base is that the model developed by American biologist Steven Amstrup (now at Polar Bears International, an NGO) assumed any polar bear population decline would be caused by less summer ice, despite the Beaufort Sea experience. Moreover, Amstrup and fellow modelers were overly confident in their claim that summer ice was critical for the polar bear’s survival and they had little data on which to base their assumption that less summer ice would devastate the polar bears’ prey. Consequently, many scientists were surprised when other researchers subsequently found that ringed and bearded seals (the primary prey of polar bears) north of the Bering Strait especially thrived with a longer open-water season, which is particularly conducive to fishing: These seals do most of their feeding in summer. More food for seals in summer means more fat seal pups for polar bears to eat the following spring, a result that’s probably true throughout the Arctic. As long as polar bears have lots of baby seals to eat in spring, they get fat enough to survive even a longer-than-usual summer fast. And while it’s true that studies in some regions show polar bears are lighter in weight than they were in the 1980s, there is no evidence that more individuals are starving to death or becoming too thin to reproduce because of less summer ice. Not all bears get enough to eat in the spring, of course. Starvation has always been the leading natural cause of death for polar bears, due to a number of factors including competition, injury, tooth decay and illness. Some cancers induce a muscle-wasting syndrome that leads to faster-than-usual weight loss. This is likely what happened to the emaciated Baffin Island bear captured on video in July 2017 and promoted by National Geographic late last year. The videographers claimed it showed what starvation due to sea-ice loss looked like — an implausible conclusion given the time of year, the isolated nature of the incident, and the fact that sea ice that year was no more reduced than previously.  Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.  Article content That starving-bear video may have convinced a few more gullible people that only hundreds of polar bears are left in the world. But it also motivated others to locate the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List report for 2015 that estimated global polar bear numbers at somewhere between 22,000-31,000, or about 26,000, up slightly from 20,000-25,000, or about 22,500, in 2005. Newer counts not included in the 2015 assessment potentially add another 2,500 or so to the total. This increase may not be statistically significant, but it is decidedly not the 67-per-cent decline that was predicted given the ice conditions that prevailed. The failure of the 2007 polar bear survival model is a simple fact that explodes the myth that polar bears are on their way to extinction. Although starving-bear videos and scientifically insignificant research papers still make the news, they don’t alter the facts: Polar bears are thriving, making them phony icons, and false idols, for global warming alarmists.

ea538d9a,"Equally troubling was the more recent discovery by Tom Fitz, a geology professor at Northland College in Ashland, Wis., of a highly carcinogenic asbestos-form mineral at one of GTac’s sampling sites. The fibers of the mineral, which would be dispersed in blasting, are like tiny, breathable needles.  Last September, several hundred people gathered outside John F. Kennedy Memorial Airport in Ashland, a few miles from GTac’s mining site, to commemorate Kennedy’s 1963 speech, which called for legislation to protect the area’s natural resources and promoted its economic potential as a scenic region for recreation. One of the last to speak at the event was Mike Wiggins Jr., the chairman of the Bad River tribe and the mine’s most formidable opponent.  The Bad River fear the contamination of the fish they depend on for food and the destruction of sensitive wild rice beds that they harvest on the coast of Lake Superior. Mr. Wiggins has voiced his opposition to the mining legislation in private meetings with Mr. Walker, led Wisconsin’s tribes in demonstrations at the State Capitol in Madison and allocated hundreds of thousands of dollars of the Bad River tribe’s scant resources to legal fees to fight the mine.  The Bad River and several other tribes assert that the state has no right to permit the enormous mine without their agreement since the site lies in “ceded territory,” an area covering a large portion of Northern Wisconsin where tribal members maintain special hunting, fishing and harvesting rights enshrined in federal treaties. Last June, one of the tribes established an educational camp near the mining site to draw attention to how the mine would violate its treaty rights, as well as to highlight sustainable alternatives to mining. GTac responded to a minor altercation with protesters unconnected to the camp by hiring an Arizona-based private-security firm, which sent guards armed with semiautomatic weapons to patrol the mine site. The guards have since been withdrawn; the camp is still there.  In the Chippewa tradition, a decision is made based on how it will affect people seven generations forward. By contrast, the company’s optimistic estimate for the life span of the first phase of the mine is 35 years. Last summer Mr. Wiggins played Governor Walker a recording of Kennedy’s speech. Mr. Wiggins said that the governor appeared indifferent to Kennedy’s words; Mr. Walker has never wavered in his support of the mine.  Though GTac has already begun bulk sampling iron ore at the site, the mine still faces many hurdles before it can be permitted. The company has filed incomplete sampling applications with the state’s Department of Natural Resources. GTac’s president, Bill Williams, is facing a criminal inquiry in Spain for alleged environmental crimes, which are unrelated to the GTac mine. The charges state that runoff from an open-pit mine where he once worked as an executive contaminated local groundwater. Mr. Williams denies the charges and declined to comment on them. Most important, the tribes will almost certainly challenge the mine in federal court.  Mr. Wiggins and five other tribal leaders have already begun seeking redress from the federal government. Last August, they sent President Obama a letter asking him to direct the Interior Department to prevent the construction of GTac’s mine, citing their claims that the mine would infringe on their treaty rights.  Though the letter did not mention it, five years ago Mr. Obama told nearly 400 Native American tribal leaders, “We have a lot to learn from your nations in order to create the kind of sustainability in our environment that we so desperately need.” The president said that the tribes “deserve to have a voice” and “will not be forgotten as long as I’m in this White House.” Last week, Mr. Wiggins said that although he has gotten preliminary responses from two federal agencies, he is still awaiting an answer from the president.",The Fight for Wisconsin’s Soul - The New York Times,mixture,
9b9c9838,"Climate scientists, who specialize in thinking about the Earth system as a whole, are often reticent to link any one weather event to global climate change. But they say that aspects of the case of Hurricane Harvey—and the recent history of tropical cyclones worldwide—suggest global warming is making a bad situation worse. It may not be obvious why global warming has anything to do with hurricane strength. Climate change is caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. These gases prevent some of the sun’s rays from bouncing back into space, trapping heat in the planetary system and raising air temperatures all over the world. As the world warms, evaporation speeds up. So on avg there's more water vapour for a storm to sweep up & dump now, compared to 70 years ago. https://t.co/M4R9OFFZt9 — Katharine Hayhoe (@KHayhoe) August 24, 2017 This warmer air causes evaporation to happen faster, which can lead to more moisture in the atmosphere. But that phenomenon alone does not explain climate change’s effects on Harvey. Storms like Harvey are helped by one of the consequences of climate change: As the air warms, some of that heat is absorbed by the ocean, which in turn raises the temperature of the sea’s upper layers. Harvey benefited from unusually toasty waters in the Gulf of Mexico. As the storm roared toward Houston last week, sea-surface waters near Texas rose to between 2.7 and 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit above average. These waters were some of the hottest spots of ocean surface in the world. The tropical storm, feeding off this unusual warmth, was able to progress from a tropical depression to a category-four hurricane in roughly 48 hours. “This is the main fuel for the storm,” says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research. “Although these storms occur naturally, the storm is apt to be more intense, maybe a bit bigger, longer-lasting, and with much heavier rainfalls [because of that ocean heat].” This also suggests an explanation for one of Harvey’s strangest and scariest behaviors. The storm intensified up until the moment of landfall, achieving category-four strength hours before it slammed into the Texas coast. This is not only rare for tropical cyclones in the western Gulf of Mexico: It may be unique. In the past 30 years of records, no storms west of Florida have intensified in the last 12 hours before landfall. Why do storms normally weaken—and why didn’t Harvey? As mentioned above, hurricanes feed and grow on warm ocean surface waters. But as they grow, their strong winds often pick up seawater, churning the oceans and moving the warmest waters deep below the surface. The same winds also bring newer, colder water closer to the atmosphere, which usually serves to drain energy and weaken the storm.",Russian Lawyer Who Met Trump Jr. Saw a Clinton Scandal in Tax Inquiry,mixture,

721fde78,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Contact: Jennie Kennedy May 13, 2016 Rep. Celia Israel Disappointed in Court Ruling Finding School Finance System Unconstitutional, Calls for Immediate Special Session Austin - Rep. Celia Israel (D-Travis County) is asking Gov. Abbott to call a special session to fully fund public education in light of today's Texas Supreme Court decision upholding the current woefully inadequate school finance system. ""I am extremely disappointed in the ruling today from the Texas Supreme Court. It was especially surprising to see the court label our system 'Byzantine' and 'meeting minimal standards' at the same time."" Israel said. ""Texas deserves better. We cannot continue to crow about our economic growth and continue to act as if a 'Byzantine' system serves our children and our future well. I call upon Governor Abbott to immediately call a Special Session so Texas can fully invest in its education system."" Israel expressed disappointment in the Court's ruling striking down Judge John Dietz's finding lawmakers ignored the real costs of education and the impact of the significant cuts made during the 2011 Session, all the while raising standards for Texas students and requiring schools to provide more elaborate programs. The Court's ruling appears to leave the Legislature as the last word as to whether Texas is fulfilling its constitutional mandate to ""make suitable provision for the support and maintenance of an efficient system of public schools."" When adjusted for inflation, per student spending has remained relatively flat over the past 16 years. Despite that trend, Texas schools in 2017 will receive $381 less per student than they did in 2003. It would take an additional $3.5 billion next biennium just to get our schools where they were 14 years ago. At the same time, state support for public schools continues to fall behind the cost of inflation, does not account for changes in student needs or academic standards, and fails to fund equitably between districts. ""It's time for big ideas and Texas-sized leadership,"" Israel said, noting her constituents will no longer accept the ""business as usual"" approach to education funding, even with the Court's ruling. ""I am confident that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will work together to make a public school system that provides the resources needed for all students to be successful, no matter where they live or what their background.

643feac4,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Marco Rubio R-FL and Jim Risch R-ID issued the following statement regarding the impending declassification of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence release of a partisan report on CIA interrogation and detention programs:  “The one-sided report that will be released by Democrats on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence cost U.S. tax-payers over $40 million dollars to produce, and its authors never interviewed a single CIA official.  “It is unconscionable that the Committee and the White House would support releasing this report despite warnings from our allies, the U.S. State Department, and a new coordinated Intelligence Community document assessing the increased risk to the United States the release of this report poses. We are concerned that this release could endanger the lives of Americans overseas, jeopardize U.S. relations with foreign partners, potentially incite violence, create political problems for our allies, and be used as a recruitment tool for our enemies. Simply put, this release is reckless and irresponsible. We have written to the administration reminding them of these concerns.  “Congress has a legitimate and necessary role to play in conducting serious and constructive oversight of our intelligence agencies and capabilities. This report does not qualify as either serious or constructive. This was a partisan effort that divided members of the committee, and the committee against the people of the CIA. We voted against this report because it is flawed, and voted against declassifying this report because we believed that its release could put American lives at risk, be used to contribute to propaganda against the United States by our enemies, and damage U.S. foreign policy and counterterrorism efforts.  “The American civilian and uniformed personnel who worked tirelessly in the days and months after the September 11, 2001 attacks on our nation to keep us safe and prevent another mass casualty event deserve our eternal gratitude, not politically–motivated attacks. As a nation at war, we need a coherent detention and interrogation policy in order to extract valuable intelligence about terrorist networks from captured operatives.

8fbb7177,"When Gov. Rick Scott addressed an elite group of Florida business leaders at the Willard Hotel in Washington a few nights ago, the doors were shut tight, ensuring that whatever Scott said would not be reported. That was bad. But here's the good news: We now know what Scott told the famously private Council of 100, thanks to Scott himself, and his newfound commitment to sunshine. The key points of Scott's speech and a ""survey"" he gave his guests can be found online as part of ""Project Sunburst,"" the new website that offers the public a glimpse of the massive daily email traffic in and out of the governor's office. ""Intro — priorities,"" reads the first page of Scott's Council of 100 speech, followed by the key points of jobs, education and keeping the cost of living low. The material was in the in-box of a press aide. The Council of 100 cares a lot about higher education, and the group clashed with Scott on two big issues in that policy area. The council favored a bill to let the University of Florida and Florida State University set market-rate tuition, which Scott vetoed, and the group opposed making Florida Polytechnic the state's 12th university, which Scott approved. After his speech, Scott gave the Council of 100 a nine-page survey of questions, many of which were framed so as to put the state's condition in a favorable light. Question No. 1: ""For the two years ending June 2011, what was the average annual change in the total budget of the 11 state universities?"" Five choices followed. The ""right"" answer was plus 9.85 percent, according to Scott. That's Scott spin. The figure is somewhat misleading because it includes universities' rents, concessions and donations. State support for universities, in fact, has been on a steady decline for years. Earlier in the day, university leaders had emphasized to the same Council of 100 that the state now provides 21 percent of the universities' budgets, down from 30 percent four years ago. Scott didn't tell the full story, which we wouldn't have known if the speaking materials weren't online. A lot of the online email is dry stuff, such as weekly reports from the bureaucratic trenches, forwarded copies of news stories. But when editors of most Florida newspapers gush with praise for one of the country's least popular governors, that's a significant development. The Florida Society of News Editors praised Scott for Sunburst, which displays emails to and from Scott and 11 staffers on flgov.com/sunburst (the username and password are both ""sunburst""). ""We want to commend you,"" the editors wrote Scott. ""Your efforts undoubtedly will inspire other public officials and local governments in Florida to follow your lead."" The system is flawed. For example, it would be better if email to and from the governor's budget office could be viewed. But Scott gets credit for improving transparency in government and for setting an example for the rest. The candidate who refused to meet with editorial boards in 2010 now does so often. The governor-elect whose emails were carelessly deleted during his transition to power now lets the public see email online. That's progress.

5a2459c3,"A measure to limit Florida school board member terms has gained the support of the two men seeking the Republican nomination to become the state's next governor. They did not weigh in, though, on the other two provisions the concept is tied to as it heads to the November ballot. U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, a Jacksonville Republican in his third term, isn't one to talk much about Florida-specific issues. He did, however, take time to publicize his position on school board term limits, perhaps the most popular of the three ideas in the constitutional amendment. It also asks voters to require civics literacy program in public schools, and to allow the Legislature to create new education models outside the control of local school boards. ""No elected office, whether federal or local, is ever better off when run by career politicians,"" DeSantis, a three-term House member from Jacksonville, wrote in a piece for the U.S. Term Limits website. ""That's why I support eight-year term limits for all school board members,"" continued DeSantis, who also has sponsored legislation to limit Congressional terms. ""I am confident this proposal would bring new energy and ideas to school boards, which too often suffer from the same untamed incumbency that paralyzes Congress."" Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, by most accounts a the candidate more likely to focus on policy details, shared that point of view. ""If term limits are good enough for the governor and the Legislature, they're good enough for school boards,"" Putnam said via email. Supporters of Amendment 8, the Constitution Revision Commission's education-focused ballot question, have focused attention on the term limits portion. The new political committee backing the measure this week referred to the proposal in its press release as being about ""school board term limits and other K-12 policy."" It's that ""other"" part that has opponents most concerned. They have taken to social media to complain that the section ""amending Section 4 of Article IX of the State Constitution to specify which schools are operated, controlled, and supervised by a school board"" could establish a second level of public schools run without local control, with appointed boards based in Tallahassee or elsewhere. The original language, before the Constitution Revision Commission amended it, spoke directly of a state charter school authorizer. Only later did the commission change the wording to be more general.","Late diagnosis of lung cancer hitting survival rate, study says",mixture,

45525605,"The NHS has spent almost £1bn giving 74,000 cancer patients drugs rejected by the medicines regulator but does not know if they have extended their lives, the National Audit Office has said. In a new report released on Thursday, the NAO castigated the NHS and Department of Health’s failure to collect data on the outcomes experienced by patients helped by the Cancer Drugs Fund as a major weakness. Meg Hillier, the Labour MP who chairs the public accounts committee, said the NHS and the Department of Health’s failure to ensure data collation “makes no sense” and made it impossible to judge if the scheme had succeeded in extending patients’ survival. The budgets of other NHS services have also suffered as a result of spending sums as large as £416m a year on the fund, the public spending watchdog found. The fund, set up by the coalition government in 2010, has improved access to more than 40 cancer drugs not usually available on the NHS which might enhance survival, the NAO said. Most recipients had a terminal form of the disease. It has approved requests for more than 74,000 patients since its creation, when some doctors saw it as compromising the role and judgment of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Nice. Between 2013 and 2015, 51% of those patients received drugs that Nice had assessed but not recommended for routine use either because it did not deem them worthwhile on grounds of cost or clinical effectiveness, or both. Their receipt meant that England increased the use of new cancer drugs relative to other comparable countries, although did not close the gap. The other 49% got drugs that Nice was examining at the time or which had not yet been appraised. While some patients have received drugs costing less than £10,000, others got medication costing more than £100,000. Initially the fund underspent its budget by 28%. But recently it has overshot it and is likely to spend £70m more than planned in 2015-16, the NAO said. “Taking 2013-14 and 2014-15 together, NHS England overspent the allocated budget for the fund by 35%. The overspend meant that less money was available for other services,” the NAO’s report on its investigation into the fund says. Hillier said that “at a time of increased pressures on NHS funding, the cancer drugs fund is not sustainable in its current form. There needs to be much better control of costs and proper assessment of whether these drugs are making a difference to the health of patients.” Spiralling costs prompted NHS England to axe 16 drugs from the list of medicines the fund would pay for in March, followed by another dozen earlier this month. Cancer charities warned that the withdrawals would mean that some patients died. It is consulting on replacing the fund with a much cheaper “managed access fund” that would cover the costs of promising new cancer drugs for a set period while Nice decided if they represented value for money or not. Lady Morgan, the chief executive at Breast Cancer Now, said: “It’s been clear for some time now that it no longer works. This report just confirms for us what we already knew.“The government, the NHS and the pharmaceutical industry have overpromised to those that depend on them and, by failing to agree on realistic prices for new drugs, the simple fact is that people will die sooner from breast and other cancers.” Heidi Alexander, the shadow health secretary, said the scaling back of the fund represented a broken promise by the Conservatives, who had pledged to continue investing if re-elected in May. She said: “The Tories promised to fix the broken system for funding cancer medicines in the last parliament, but failed to do so. Now they are having to remove drugs from the Cancer Drugs Fund, breaking one of David Cameron’s key election pledges to cancer patients.” The Department of Health said it remained committed to the fund.",Khrushchev tours America: 'No sour cabbage soup for these people',mixture,

The plan includes several components to address mounting economic and fiscal challenges facing the State -- many of which were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic -- and to help forge a better path forward for all New Yorkers.  “Under New York’s one-party control, we have seen a dramatic and unwelcome shift in our state’s priorities. Democrats displayed no interest in rebuilding our local economy, lessening the financial burden on our middle class, or stemming the ever-increasing outflow of New York residents fleeing our state. They sought to release dangerous criminals into our communities, undermine our law enforcement, and waste millions of dollars on progressive agenda items. The COVID-19 pandemic has only highlighted the need for immediate action on the unresolved challenges facing our small business community and New York’s hardworking taxpayers,” said Senate Republican Leader Robert Ortt.  The Senate Republicans’ plan includes proposals that prioritize restarting our local economies, rethinking how New York State operates, and renewing a commitment to New York State’s residents to ensure strong, robust communities.  Restart our Local Economies by:  · Safely reopening our small businesses to help them get back on their feet and offer gainful employment for residents;  · Helping our schools and colleges stay open; and  · Investing in our physical and human infrastructure to rebuild our state’s competitiveness.  Rethink how New York State Operates by:  · Ending New York State’s unaffordability problem, which has been made worse by the pandemic;  · Taking on State government’s culture of overspending and restoring fiscal responsibility; and  · Reasserting the Legislature’s constitutional authority as an equal branch of government.  Renew our Commitment to Residents by:  · Fostering the growth of vibrant local communities;  · Developing a robust economy with diverse opportunities; and  · Creating safer neighborhoods with common sense public safety measures.  “New York government is failing its people. Broken policies have made New York more expensive, less safe and have diminished the quality of life for our residents. We need to change course before it is too late,” said Deputy Leader Andrew Lanza.  “Throughout this pandemic, there seems to have been little interest from New York’s one-party leadership in stepping up and taking an active legislative role in constructively combating the pandemic by putting our communities’ safety and livelihoods at the forefront of legislative policy. I’m proud to join my colleagues in offering actual solutions to help us rise to meet the challenges ahead. I call on my colleagues across the political spectrum to join us as we work toward ending this terrible crisis and rebuilding our state for the better,” said Senator Fred Akshar.  “While New York State once stood tall in our nation as a pillar of economic strength, educational excellence and public policy innovation, its leadership today is more dubious. High taxes, excessive, job-killing regulations, and a rising crime rate have made us number one in population loss, and a misguided focus on politically driven agendas has diverted precious resources away from our core responsibilities. With the added challenges created by the pandemic, the future of our state hangs in the balance. If there was ever a compelling case to rethink and change course, this is it,” said Senator George M. Borrello.  “Long before the COVID-19 pandemic turned our world upside down, New York faced daunting challenges, including a looming budget deficit and a shrinking population. The corona virus has exacerbated our problems, adding to the financial burden we face and bringing our economy and many small businesses to the brink. As we fight the pandemic, we must also safely re-open our economy, control spending, ease the burden on taxpayers and restore our system of checks and balances in state government,” said Senator Patrick M. Gallivan.  “We have seen an exodus of New York residents, families and businesses who have fled the state for better opportunities elsewhere because of unwelcome policies, burdensome regulations and high taxes. Substantive and dramatic change is needed, especially at a time when the state’s fiscal challenges have been significantly exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. This plan refocuses the state’s priorities and helps to build a better and brighter future for New York,” said Senator Joseph Griffo.  “Together we can restore New York to its rightful status as the Empire State. To accomplish this we must work with our small business owners, farmers and other job creators. My focus is on getting New York open for business and helping people get back to work safely. This common sense package would help the communities I represent and put our state on the road to real economic recovery and future prosperity,” said Senator Pam Helming.  “Overcoming the unprecedented, ongoing health, economic, and community challenges posed by COVID-19 requires big, bold solutions. We need to rethink the state’s approach to solving problems, successfully restart our economy, and renew our commitment to residents and each other. Partisan politics and a bureaucratic Albany trapped in the old ways of doing things won’t work. What will work is advancing smarter public policies that recognize the breadth and depth of our challenges and the necessity of fresh thinking that goes beyond party labels. It’s time for our state to hit the reset button, and it begins with the priorities and principles we are unveiling today. Our Reset New York State plan reflects our continued efforts to bring New Yorkers together and improve the quality of life across our state. We are ready to answer the challenges of COVID and deliver the positive change New Yorkers expect and rightfully deserve,” said Senator Daphne Jordan.  “Between July 2019 and July 2020, New York State led the nation in at least one thing- people moving out. The pandemic only accelerated a trend that was already in place. High taxes and an unfriendly business climate are the real culprits. Our small businesses need help and our state needs a new direction. We already know what works from other states that are growing and not shrinking. We don’t need to reinvent the wheel, instead we need a reset. Senate Republicans have a plan to do just that and I'm proud to support it,” said Senator Michael Martucci.  “As our state begins to emerge from the current crisis, it is vital that we start immediately working together to make our state’s future brighter than the past. The ‘Reset New York’ plan reflects the priorities of hardworking New Yorkers and I am proud to join with my colleagues in the Senate Republican Conference to make sure their voices are heard in Albany. The challenges our state faces are not new but the solutions must be – and finding them must be our main focus,” said Senator Mario Mattera.  “I look forward throughout this new legislative session to our Senate Republican Conference giving voice to the need for rebuilding local economies, focusing on stronger and safer communities, and resisting what threatens to be a devastating expansion of a business-as-usual, tax-and-spend direction in state government. This ‘Reset New York’ strategy begins our commitment to more fiscally responsible, commonsense government that works better for taxpayers, builds and protects livelihoods, honors public safety and security, and focuses like never before on the restoration of Upstate’s rightful place in New York government,” said Senator Tom O’Mara.  “New York is facing true challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic is one reason for our struggles, but wayward state policies that fail to meet the needs of our small businesses, families, and taxpayers, are the real culprit. There is no margin for error and the time is now to change course by enacting the Reset New York agenda. Specifically, broadband access, support for our farmers, and a strong educational system are among the initial building blocks that can set us on the right path. Let’s enact policies that create opportunities, not those that confine us,” said Senator Peter Oberacker.  “Long Island’s families, businesses and seniors are hurting and need greater support and relief from state government, both in the immediate term to help get through the pandemic and in the future to ensure that New York is a more affordable and safer place to call home. Reset New York will put us on a trajectory to accomplish these goals and begin to reverse the trends of higher taxes, burdensome regulations, and more crime that has caused hundreds of thousands of residents to flee the Empire State,” said Senator Anthony Palumbo.  “New York is in desperate need of a reset. The pandemic has highlighted and exasperated the issues that our state has faced for decades. We continue to lose residents and jobs, with our high taxes and over regulations. Our communities are suffering. Small businesses, restaurants and family farms are struggling to stay afloat. We need to provide real answers and solutions to help our local economies and save our struggling communities. We can no longer ignore these glaring issues. New Yorkers need results now,” said Senator Ed Rath.  “In recent years, people have been fleeing New York State due to high taxes, a lack of opportunity, and red tape that hinders business growth. The pandemic has only made matters worse and now, more than ever, our state needs a reset. From reenergizing our small businesses to making New York more affordable for hardworking taxpayers, my colleagues and I are committed to fighting for changes that will improve our state in the wake of this unprecedented pandemic,” said Senator Patty Ritchie.  “Despite the unprecedented challenges that our communities are facing, New Yorkers have remained resilient, and now more than ever, they need a government determined to deliver results. If we want to rebuild our state, we have to start by resetting the state's priorities and ensuring that the needs of hardworking, law-abiding New Yorkers are firmly at the top. I am proud to join with my colleagues to reaffirm our commitment to that goal and to do all that we can to ensure that small businesses, middle class families, and struggling New Yorkers have a strong, independent voice on their side,” said Senator Sue Serino.  “There’s only one way forward and that’s to enable our businesses and communities, big and small, to have the best possible chance to recover. When the need for help is apparent, too often the response of government is to throw an anvil instead of a life-preserver into the water. We can’t make this harder with higher taxes and more unreasonable demands. Our vision must show that we are listening. That’s what this is about,” said Senator Dan Stec.  “As we begin a New Year and new legislative session, our top priority must continue to be addressing the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic so we can stop the spread of the virus, save lives and safely reopen our economy. In order to reset New York State by safely restarting our economy, we need to address the elephant in the room that our state government is not talking about: the fact that for the third year in a row, New York leads the nation in outmigration of residents, with 126,000 people leaving last year and over one million in the past decade. When enough people who can afford to leave New York State are gone, who will be left to pay for the infrastructure, health care, schools and other necessities? I look forward to joining with Leader Ortt and my colleagues in the Senate Republican Conference in the coming weeks and months to address these issues and put forth policies to turn things around so the Empire State does not become the ‘Empty State,’” said Senator Jim Tedisco.  “I look forward to joining my Senate Republican Conference colleagues in advancing our ambitious Reset New York plan today. As we all work toward opening our State and local communities safely from the COVID-19 pandemic, our focus must be on the economy, which starts with advancing policies that support small businesses, which are the backbones of our communities, jobs, public safety, improving our local infrastructure, and ensuring our schools get their fair share. One party control has pushed those priorities to the side and with our Reset New York plan, our Conference will ensure that the voices of our constituents are heard,” said Senator Alexis Weik.  ###",Senate Republican Leader Ortt And Republican Conference Announce Plan to “Reset New York State”,mixture,
50efae0c,"Press Release via Competitive Elections Wisconsin.  Open Letter to Rep. Robin Vos, Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly  Speaker Vos,  Wisconsin’s legislature suffers from a serious deficit of democracy. Thanks to restrictive and anti-competitive ballot laws, almost half of Representatives 47 out of 99 were the only name on the ballot in the November 2014 general election. That’s half of voters who got no debate, no discussion, no choice- no real election at all. A similarly large number of races were uncontested in the August primary. In the 12th Assembly District, I was one of many who had no choice in either the primary or the general election.  This is compared to just 9 out of 134 Representatives who ran unopposed in Minnesota. In Michigan all 110 State Representative elections were contested by both major parties. It is hard to believe that people in Wisconsin are that much more disinterested in deciding who their legislators are.  Voters are, in fact, viscerally disgusted when they go to the polls only to find that their time has been wasted with slates of unopposed candidates. So why do our State Assembly elections look more like the selection of a Soviet Politburo or House of Lords than a freely-elected American state legislature?  The problem is simple. For all offices in Wisconsin, the number of signatures required for nomination petitions is too high. These levels are set such that incumbents and candidates with party backing can meet them with ease, but upstart challengers are often scared off from even attempting it. This is often couched in terms of “serious candidates only” – a decision that is surely for voters to make.  This policy harms voters by denying them a debate and a choice, but it also wastes taxpayer resources as the Government Accountability Board scrambles to scrutinize tens of thousands of signatures by statutory deadlines. This process, where candidates are invited to try to kick each other off the ballot based on technicalities, serves no legitimate public interest. The argument against an overcrowded ballot strains credulity in the face of severely under-crowded ballots.  A simple and obvious measure which could be taken to help fix this problem, before the 2016 election, would be to reduce the number of signatures required on nomination petitions by half, across the board. This would bring Wisconsin in line with the norm in neighboring states, and greatly reduce the number of uncontested elections. Such a modest reform would also not require any other substantive changes to the structure of Wisconsin’s election laws.  All voters should demand free, open, fair, and competitive elections, where all ideas can be heard and considered as part of our civic discourse. Citizens who wish to engage in the democratic process as candidates, should not face unreasonable barriers to entry. Any legislator who ran unopposed in 2014 should be challenged to support this necessary change, as should all Representatives who value the integrity and legitimacy of Wisconsin’s elections. I urge you to give this proposal serious consideration, before Wisconsin has a State Assembly where an outright majority of Representatives were not meaningfully “elected” at all.  Andy Craig  Secretary, Libertarian Party of Wisconsin  Midwest Regional Director, Our America Initiative  Lead Coordinator, Competitive Elections Wisconsin  “We support election systems that are more representative of the electorate at the federal, state and local levels. … We oppose laws that effectively exclude alternative candidates and parties, deny ballot access, gerrymander districts, or deny the voters their right to consider all legitimate alternatives.” – Platform of the Libertarian Party  Competitive Elections Wisconsin is a joint project of the Libertarian Party of Wisconsin and Our America Initiative, led by Libertarian Congressional candidate and IPR contributor Andy Craig.",Competitive Elections Wisconsin issues open letter to State Assembly Speaker,mixture,
,"Authorities in Scotland have officially listed the Covid-19 vaccine as the underlying cause in multiple deaths according to official records.  National Records of Scotland (NRS), the equivalent of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in England have listed three deaths occurring before the 30th April 2021 “with the underlying cause of death being due to adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines”. The official statistic can be viewed on table 12 of the downloadable excel document via the NRS website here.  This of course has not made headline news in the mainstream media as it would destroy the narrative that the authorities have built to persuade every adult to take an experimental, unnecessary jab via psychological warfare, propaganda, and ostrasisation of the ‘experimental vaccine hesitant’.  So what better way is there to counter the officially listed vaccine deaths than to continue the psychological warfare by rolling-out a behavioural scientist and dress them up as a “Public Health expert”? Because that is exactly what the Scottish Government have done.  Here’s BBC Scotland’s version of the authorities response to the listed vaccines deaths –  Public health expert Prof Linda Bauld said the “vast, vast majority” of Covid vaccine side effects were very mild.  The professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh told BBC Scotland that serious adverse effects from any vaccine were extremely unusual.  “The vast, vast majority of side effects from the Covid vaccines are very mild. You do have severe cases, but only very rarely,” she said.  “We have been aware of the rare blood clots that we think are linked to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine… but it’s not always possible to say the vaccine caused it. There may be other contributory factors.”  What qualifications does Professor Linda Bauld have to make her a “Public Health expert”? She has a PhD in ‘Social Policy’ and a Bachelor’s degree in ‘Political Science’. Why is a behavioural scientist considered as a “Public Health expert”? Because the past 14 months have had nothing to do with a virus, they’ve been entirely about control.  As for the vast majority of side effects from the Covid vaccine being mild, do you consider suffering a stroke mild? Do you consider going blind mild? Do you consider suffering a seizure mild? Do you consider being paralysed mild? Because these are the adverse reactions that are being reported to the MHRA Yellow Card scheme, with a significant amount of strokes being reported as of the latest update at the time of writing which includes reports made to and officially recorded by the MHRA up to the 12th May 2021.  The data shows that 34 people have gone blind after having the Pfizer jab, however the AstraZeneca jab has performed significantly worse with 176 reporting that they have gone blind after having the experimental jab.  Why are people going blind? Most likely as a result of suffering a stroke, with a vast array of different types of stroke being suffered. As of the 12th May the number of cerebrovascular accidents had increased by 6272.73% in just 15 weeks to a total of 701, with 32 of these sadly resulting in death. The number of ischaemic strokes also went up, increasing by 8300% to a total of 84. There had also been 122 cerebral haemorrhages, 57 cerebral infarctions, 74 subarachnoid haemorrhages, and 40 intracranial haemorrhages, among many others.  The MHRA have also confirmed that they have received 56 reports of death out of 309 reports of thrombo-embolic events with concurrent thromocytopenia for the AstraZeneca vaccine, 7 of which occurred in people aged 18 -29. However they don’t go as far as to list the vaccine as the definitive cause, instead adding the caveat that “it is not clear if this is a coincidence or side effect from the vaccine”.  The fact that National Records of Scotland have officially listed the experimental Covid-19 vaccines as the cause of death is a game-changer, but it will of course be swept under the carpet. But the number of deaths is in fact significantly higher, with 1,180 deaths listed in the MHRA Yellow Card scheme report as of the 12th May 2021.  But we also can’t forget the freedom of information request made to Public Health Scotland back in February in which a person asked –  “Could you please provide the total number of deaths for any reason within 28 days of having a Covid vaccine from the start of the vaccination roll out date?”  To which Public Health Scotland confirmed –  “Using the latest mortality data available (Up to 26th February), 2,207 people have died within 28 days of vaccination (number of days between vaccine and death is 0-27 where 0 is the day of vaccination).”  Will you be having the experimental jab?",Covid-19 Vaccine officially listed as the underlying cause of death multiple times by Scotland Authorities,mixture,152560620072367015359812149597447873853
ee916575,"Barack Obama hikes with National Park Service staffers to the Exit Glacier at Kenai Fjords National Park in Seward, Alaska. President Obama hiked to Exit Glacier in Alaska last week, with photographers in tow, to send the world a message: The glacier is melting.
Obama blames it on the increasing use of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, which he wants to restrict not only in the United States but worldwide. The photo op was designed to build support for an international climate agreement he’s pushing hard to sell, so far with little success. Trouble is, the president needs to get his facts straight. Exit Glacier has been shrinking for 200 years — since 1815 — long before widespread industrialization and automobiles. As the president ended his trip, he sounded the alarm again: “This state’s climate is changing before our eyes.” News flash, Mr. President: Alaska has been buffeted by cyclical swings in climate for thousands of years. That’s true for the rest of the world, too. There was a 300-year-long Medieval heat wave, followed by a Little Ice Age that began around 1300, and then the 300-year warming period we’re in now. The Anchorage Daily Times ran a front-page story in 1922 recording the “unheard-of temperatures” in the Arctic and glaciers disappearing. “The Arctic Ocean is warming up and icebergs are growing scarcer.” Oblivious to the history of constant climate change, Obama pointed to Exit Glacier and said: “We want to make sure our grandkids can see this.” He may get his wish, but it won’t be because of anything he’s doing. The current warming trend appears to be over, speculates Roger Cohen, a fellow of the American Physical Society. The Alaska Climate Research Center reports almost no evidence of warming trends in Alaska since 1977. Many scientists are predicting the onset of two or three centuries of cooler weather — which would mean bigger glaciers. That’s despite the world’s growing use of fossil fuels. No matter what humans do, temperature trends go up, and then down; glaciers expand and then recede; sea levels rise and then fall, explains Will Happer, professor emeritus of physics at Princeton. That doesn’t mean pollution controls are futile. We all want to breathe clean air. But don’t blame climate change on humans. There are bigger forces at work here. Scientists disagree about what these forces are, and are researching better ways of accurately measuring temperature trends via satellite. Amid all this controversy and uncertainty about global climate change, Obama blindly insists that his theory of global warming “is beyond dispute” and attacks his critics as “deniers.” Sounding more like an Old Testament doomsayer than a president, Obama warned in his Alaska speech that unless carbon fuels are restricted, “we will condemn our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair: Submerged countries. Abandoned cities. Fields no longer growing.” Sounds scary, but he’s on thin ice backing up those predictions. Despite Obama’s professed concern for the people of Alaska affected by climate change, his visit was more about theatrics than helping locals. Alaska’s Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski lambasted Obama’s job-killing new restrictions on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic. Obama says the region’s “very fragile,” but Murkowski is more worried that the economy is fragile. “It’s clear this administration does not care about us and sees us as nothing but a territory,” she said.

It’s a demonstration of Obama’s appalling lack of priorities. The president told his Alaska audience that “few things will disrupt our lives as profoundly as climate change.” Really, Mr. President? How about the epidemic of cop shootings in the United States, or the drowned toddlers washing up on Mediterranean shores as families flee the Middle East, or ISIS beheading thousands of Christians?

Obama says that with climate change, more than any other issue, “there is such a thing as being too late.” Tell that to a cop’s widow or the father who watched his family drown.","Wake up, Obama, climate change has been happening forever",mixture,

70c53cf5,"The text on the video above was edited on June 1, 2018 to make it clear that it is impossible to know why the polar bear pictured was starving. An earlier version of the video went too far in suggesting that climate change was responsible ( read more ). This story was updated on January 19, 2018 to reflect the more specific location of where the photographs were taken.  When photographer Paul Nicklen and filmmakers from conservation group Sea Legacy arrived on Somerset Island—near the larger Baffin Island—in the Canadian Arctic in late summer, they came across a heartbreaking sight: a starving polar bear on its deathbed.  Nicklen is no stranger to bears. From the time he was a child growing up in Canada's far north the biologist turned wildlife photographer has seen over 3,000 bears in the wild. But the emaciated polar bear, featured in videos Nicklen published to social media on December 5, was one of the most gut-wrenching sights he's ever seen.  ""We stood there crying—filming with tears rolling down our cheeks,"" he said.  Video shows the polar bear clinging to life, its white hair limply covering its thin, bony frame. One of the bear's back legs drags behind it as it walks, likely due to muscle atrophy. Looking for food, the polar bear slowly rummages through a nearby trashcan used seasonally by Inuit fishers. It finds nothing and resignedly collapses back down onto the ground.  In the days since Nicklen posted the footage, he's been asked why he didn’t intervene.  ""Of course, that crossed my mind,"" said Nicklen. ""But it's not like I walk around with a tranquilizer gun or 400 pounds of seal meat.""  And even if he did, said Nicklen, he only would have been prolonging the bear's misery. Plus, feeding wild polar bears is illegal in Canada.  The wildlife photographer says he filmed the bear's slow, beleaguered death because he didn't want it to die in vain.  ""When scientists say bears are going extinct, I want people to realize what it looks like. Bears are going to starve to death,"" said Nicklen. ""This is what a starving bear looks like.""  The Climate Change Link?  By telling the story of one polar bear, Nicklen hopes to convey a larger message about how a warming climate has deadly consequences.  Polar bears have long been unwitting mascots for the effects of climate change. As animals that live only in Arctic regions, they're often the first to feel the impacts of warming temperatures and rising seas.  The large, half-ton bears find concentrations of seals on sea ice. During summer months, it's not uncommon for polar bears to go months without eating while they wait for Arctic ice to solidify.  In 2002, a World Wildlife Fund report predicted that climate change could eventually lead to polar bear endangerment or extinction. Even then, the report found that polar bears were moving from ice to land earlier and staying on land longer, unhealthily extending the bears' fasting season. By the end of summer, most bears studied by the World Wildlife Fund showed signs of starvation.  Fifteen years later, polar bears' icy hunting grounds are in even worse shape. The National Snow and Ice Data Center, which tracks sea ice cover annually, has regularly noted record lows in sea ice coverage—a decline that is expected to only get worse. (Read more about drastic predictions for dwindling sea ice.)  A study recently published in the journal Biosciences looked at how climate science is often falsely discredited. The study found climate deniers are able to downplay the threat of climate change by discrediting the threat facing polar bears.

a14a969b,"DREAM Act applications roll in while Excelsior Scholarship applications are suspended by One Party Rule in New York  ALBANY, NY – The New York State Senate Republican Conference today slammed Democrats who have kept applications granting free tuition to illegal immigrants open while closing the Excelsior Scholarship application available to citizen students, whose families are struggling even more due to forced business closures during the coronavirus pandemic.  “Time and time again, Democrats show New Yorkers their true priorities and under One Party Rule, illegal immigrants come before hardworking, law-abiding New Yorkers. When Senate Democrats voted to create free tuition for illegal immigrants, Republicans said no. To add insult to injury, so many families are facing an even more dire financial hardship after Governor Cuomo forced their livelihoods shut. To close citizen students out of the application process while continuing to give illegal immigrants free tuition is ludicrous. New Yorkers shouldn’t be funding tuition for illegal immigrants at all, and we should be closing down that program permanently as we look to find savings in our budget,” said Senate Republican Leader Rob Ortt.  Tuition for SUNY schools is due in August, leaving parents nervous as they check the still closed application page.  “Middle class, law-abiding, taxpaying parents are struggling right now. They and their children deserve answers. New York State should not be playing politics with their futures,” said Senator Pam Helming.  “If anyone ever needed a crystal clear example of the Senate Democrat’s ‘Bizzaro World’ priorities that put illegal immigrants first and hardworking, law-abiding taxpayers dead last, look no further than this latest shameful policy. In January 2019, Senate Democrats rammed through their so-called ‘DREAM Act’ giving free college to illegal immigrants. I voted no and said their DREAM Act was a nightmare for taxpayers to the tune of $27 million annually. Now in July 2020, Senate Democrats show they’ve learned nothing as they’re shamefully keeping open applications granting free tuition to illegal immigrants while closing Excelsior Scholarship applications to citizen students, many of whom have families that are financially reeling due to the Coronavirus outbreak. This latest policy hypocrisy shows that the Senate Democrats continue catering to their illegal immigrant base while law-abiding taxpayers get another slap in the face,” said Senator Daphne Jordan.  “There may be disagreement as to whether those who are here illegally should be getting the benefits of legal citizens, but there should be no disagreement that state government should not be discriminating against citizen students and their families who are part of the Excelsior Program and who are anxiously waiting for their tuition relief applications to be processed. Every legislator took an oath of office to represent the interests of the legal citizens of this state and nation and they will have to answer to those voters in November if they fail to uphold that oath,” said Senator Jim Tedisco.  “We have law-abiding, hardworking families across the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes regions struggling to make ends meet, paying outrageously high state and local taxes, and going into huge amounts of debt trying to afford college for their children. It’s not right to ignore the needs and the hopes of these families while we turn around and continue to deliver hard-earned taxpayer dollars to provide free college tuition for illegal immigrant families,” said Senator Tom O’Mara.  “The thousands of New York students who have been shut out of this application process with no explanation from the state deserve immediate answers. Countless New Yorkers are facing unprecedented economic hardship as a result of state actions and now the state is just adding insult to injury by leaving them in this limbo. It is absolutely unacceptable and the state needs to get its priorities in order,” said Senator Sue Serino.  “Only in NYC-Democrat-ruled New York would you send law-abiding, taxpaying families to the back of the line while giving illegal immigrants preferential treatment when it comes to college tuition aid. Every parent and student who was counting on the Excelsior Scholarship for the fall semester and is now desperately worrying about how to pay the August bill deserves an explanation as to why they’ve been put on hold while applications and aid are flowing for illegal immigrants seeking a free college education at taxpayer expense. It’s outrageous, unfair, and it symbolizes everything that’s wrong in Albany under One Party Rule,” said Senator George M. Borrello.  “Many New Yorkers have suffered and continue to experience significant challenges as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. While I believe access to a quality education is important, we should not be prioritizing one segment of the state’s population, especially during this difficult time. Our focus must be on providing assistance to the state’s hardworking residents, families, business owners, and taxpayers who are struggling,” said Senator Joe Griffo.  “Senate Democrats have been clear about their priorities since day one – those that break the rules come first and those that follow the rules take a back seat. Senate Republicans have always stood with law-abiding citizens and this case is no exception,” said Senator Rich Funke.  “It is unconscionable that Democrats would punish students whose only crime is that they are citizens. It is no wonder that hard-working New York families are leaving the state in droves,” said Senator Andrew Lanza.  ###",NY Senate Republican Conference Slams Democrats For Giving Illegal Immigrants Free Tuition While Halting Applications For Struggling Citizen Students During Pandemic,mixture,
f353ec98,"More than one in 10 schools have increased the number of unqualified staff who teach lessons to counter growing shortages, a new study has revealed. Almost half 46 per cent of headteachers have reported unfilled positions at their schools, according to a TES Global survey. In an effort to fill these vacancies, 11 per cent of senior leaders are using more unqualified staff, and 26 per cent are using more supply teachers, research suggests. The leadership survey, of nearly 250 headteachers, reveals that schools have also been recruiting teachers from overseas 9 per cent and using teachers to cover subjects in which they do not specialise 16 per cent. According to a new TES Teacher Recruitment Index, based on interviews with nearly 5,000 schools, a physics teacher in London is the hardest position to fill. The second toughest to find is a secondary maths teacher in the the East of England. Schools are struggling to hire new staff in core subjects like maths, English and physics. Last month, TES learned of a secondary willing to pay a head of science a £50,000 salary to fill a vacancy. Schools in London, the South East and West Midlands are facing the biggest challenges with recruitment compared with three years ago, according to the recruitment study. Meanwhile, the North East, North West and South West are finding it easier to recruit teachers. Vic Goddard, principal at Passmores Academy in Harlow and star of TV show Educating Essex, said: “This is a challenge all over the country. Our proximity to London means that we are having to work incredibly hard to recruit teachers for shortage subjects, normally with very little success. “I am having to think very creatively about how to attract good quality teaching talent for subjects like maths, whether that’s looking overseas or even looking at how we can give teachers somewhere to live to get them to join us.” Rob Grimshaw, CEO of TES Global, said: “While we may not be facing a national crisis in teacher recruitment, it will certainly feel like it in some areas. Schools are having to become increasingly creative to find the talent they need. “The TES Recruitment Index shows recruitment challenges facing schools across England in unprecedented detail. By sharing this data we hope to support a collective and targeted response to difficulties with teacher recruitment in specific subjects and regions.” Responding to the index, a Department for Education spokesperson said: “The number and quality of teachers in our classrooms is at an all-time high. New figures show we have recruited more trainees than last year and the number of former teachers coming back to the classroom has continued to rise year after year - from 14,720 in 2011 to 17,350 in 2014. “The National Teaching Service will recruit 1500 outstanding teachers and school leaders to work in underperforming schools in challenging areas. We are expanding Teach First into every region of the country and the School Direct programme offers all schools - regardless of location - the chance to take control and develop high quality staff and future leaders. Our new range of generous bursaries – up to £30,000 in subjects such as physics - will ensure we continue to attract the best and the brightest.” For more in-depth analysis and coverage of the recruitment crisis, visit our feature here free to subsribers.

,"Ministers today (25 July 2021) pledged to cut red tape for British wine importers - saving British wine lovers up to £130m a year.  Once implemented, the change would remove the requirement for VI-1 certificates on all imports of wine into Great Britain, which means substantial savings for consumers and businesses.  The move will take away a significant burden on our wine trade, the second largest in the world in value terms. Industry analysis suggests that VI-1 certificates add 10p to every bottle of imported wine.  Removing this measure will cut red tape and ensure importing wine to Great Britain is as streamlined as possible.  Food and Drink Minister Victoria Prentis said:  The British wine industry has increasingly delivered fantastic wines at great value from all around the world.  Cutting this needless red tape will place our businesses in a stronger position internationally, as they continue to grow, while consumers can raise a glass to great wine from around the world.  Great Britain is already a global hub in the international wine trade, supporting many jobs across the country. Ending the requirement for import certificates will strengthen this position and is a clear benefit of now having the freedom to determine our own rules.  International Trade Minister Ranil Jayawardena said:  It’s fantastic that the British people will no longer have to pay for unnecessary bureaucracy when they buy a bottle of wine.  Trade is key for economic growth and levelling up the country. Through our trade deals, we are making it easier for British consumers to access to top-quality products from around the world – including wine – and we are bringing down foreign trade barriers to open up even more opportunities for British businesses to succeed overseas.  Industry analysis suggests that this move will ultimately reduce the cost of wine for consumers. This will mean that wine drinkers around the country will be able to enjoy the same high-quality products from across the world at a cheaper price - on average 10p per wine bottle imported into GB.",Red tape cut for wine imports to save British wine lovers £130m a year,mixture,340222199601518208928389011794951636825
1abdbb0e,"Every patient visiting their family doctor or attending a hospital appointment in England will be asked to declare if they are gay, straight or bisexual under controversial new rules imposed by the NHS.  The astonishing diktat – condemned last night as ‘intrusive’ and ‘insulting’ – orders doctors to include details of a patient’s sexuality on their permanent medical record for the first time.  An official NHS directive, seen by The Mail on Sunday, reveals that from April 2019 all patients aged 16 or over will face questioning about their sexual identity.  NHS England last night refused to give details about how the highly personal information will be collected – leading to fears patients could be quizzed by GPs, nurses and even receptionists.  Scroll down for video  Every patient visiting their family doctor or attending a hospital appointment in England will be asked to declare if they are gay, straight or bisexual under controversial new rules file photo  Its instructions, published last week, say that ‘sexual orientation monitoring’ should take place ‘at every face-to-face contact with the patient, where no record of this data exists’.  The directions suggest patients could be asked the highly personal question regularly if the records are not properly shared between different parts of the NHS as patients attend GP appointments, A&E, outpatients or even antenatal classes.  There are also fears about the security of the data, as any leak could potentially ‘out’ thousands of patients.  Health chiefs say NHS organisations and councils must ask so that they can obtain better data on the health of gay and bisexual people throughout England.  Failing to do so risks breaking the Equality Act 2010, gay rights groups have warned.  But last night politicians and doctors said the NHS had ‘no place’ asking all patients the question.  Former Labour Minister Graham Stringer, MP for Blackley and Broughton, said: ‘Unless it’s related to your health, your sexuality is not the NHS’s business.’  And Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ‘It sounds intrusive and Orwellian.’  Never before has the State insisted citizens face a question about their sexual identity. The Office for National Statistics considered including it in the 2011 census but decided against due to ‘concerns about the quality and accuracy of data... and issues of acceptability to respondents’.  The astonishing diktat – condemned as ‘intrusive’ and ‘insulting’ – orders doctors to include details of a patient’s sexuality on their permanent medical record for the first time file photo  People over 16 will be asked: ‘Which of the following best describes how you think of yourself?’ They can say they are ‘straight’, ‘gay or lesbian’, ‘bisexual’ or ‘other’.  They will also be able to state that they are ‘not sure’ of their sexuality, or ‘decline to provide a response’. But whatever answer they give – including if they refuse to divulge their sexuality – will be noted on their medical record for ever.  Dr Peter Swinyard, chairman of the Family Doctor Association, said: ‘I think it’s a confounded cheek to ask GPs to do this. It really is not the place of family doctors, to start monitoring people’s sexuality.  ‘We are at risk of becoming state apparatchiks, asking questions about patients’ sexuality, housing, whether they can cook, or do crochet! When someone comes in for their precious eight minutes with me, I’m interested in what they want from the consultation.  ‘It isn’t relevant to ask an 87-year-old grandmother if she has ever had a relationship with another woman. She would find that incredibly insulting and storm out. It would ruin the consultation.’  The project is being launched – without full public consultation –after at least seven years’ lobbying by the LGBT Foundation.  NHS England said the Manchester-based gay rights charity had ‘led the work to develop’ the so-called ‘sexual orientation monitoring information standard’ – the framework under which ‘all patients/service users aged 16 and over across all health services and local authorities’ will be quizzed about their sexuality.  The document, bearing the logos of both organisations, says there is ‘strong evidence’ that lesbian, gay and bisexual [LGB] people are ‘disproportionately affected’ by sexually transmitted infections, substance abuse, poor mental health and loneliness in old age.  More data would enable NHS and social care bosses to ‘better understand, respond to and improve LGB patients’ service access, outcomes and experience’ and allow ‘targeted prevention and early intervention’ work to improve their health.  The Equality Act 2010 contains a legal obligation for all public sector bodies to pay ‘due regard’ to the needs of lesbian, gay and bisexual people’ to ensure they are not discriminated against.  Collecting and analysing data on sexual orientation would be ‘evidence of compliance’ for health and social care providers, the document adds.  Dr Ian Banks, former president of the Men’s Health Forum, said in an ‘ideal world’ it would be good to have ‘big data’ about patients’ sexuality to improve health services. But he warned: ‘Some people don’t want others to know their sexuality. It’s up to them – it’s not up to NHS England to know, or the GP to ask.’  Many justifiably feared that a data breach, or request from an insurance company, could mean details of their sexuality being made public.  In March, the Information Commissioner announced it was investigating fears that medical records held by 2,700 GP practices – a third of those in England – were not secure and could be read by workers including clerical staff. Changes have since been made.  ‘People don’t believe that their notes are going to stay confidential,’ Dr Banks said. ‘Once it’s down on our medical notes, that’s it – you can’t get rid of it. And then it goes out to numerous databases.’  Those who refused to state their sexuality could face uncomfortable questions about why, he added.  In a statement, NHS England said: ‘All health bodies and local authorities with responsibility for adult social care are required under the Equality Act to ensure that no patient is discriminated against.  ‘This information standard is designed to help NHS bodies be compliant with the law by consistently collecting, only where relevant, personal details of patients such as race, sex and sexual orientation. They do not have to do it in every area, people do not have to answer the questions and it will have no impact on the care they receive.’",Doctors are ordered to ask patients if they are gay,mixture,

ffba0bf9,"Net migration to the UK has dropped to 273,000 in the year to September, down 49,000 from the previous year.  The Office for National Statistics said it was the first time in two years the balance of people arriving and leaving the UK had dipped below 300,000.  But it is short of the government's aim of an annual figure below 100,000.  Immigration was estimated to be 596,000 - comprising 268,000 EU citizens, 257,000 non-EU citizens and 71,000 British citizens.  This included the highest level ever recorded of Romanians and Bulgarians - 74,000.  Some 323,000 people are thought to have left the UK in the year to September, up by 26,000 on the 12 months to September 2015.  Of these, 128,000 were British citizens, along with 103,000 EU citizens and 93,000 non-EU citizens. line Analysis By Dominic Casciani, home affairs correspondent  Net migration is down. But while the net decrease looks substantial, nobody can say for sure what's triggered the change because these quarterly figures could have been influenced by a string of short-term factors.  For a start, there appears to have been a rise in emigration - and when that goes up, net migration can come down.  Secondly, some of the change could be down to seasonal fluctuations in student numbers.  Thirdly, although there were significant departures by people from some parts of Eastern Europe, the number coming from poorer Romania and Bulgaria went up.  The upshot is the overall number of people arriving for a job is broadly the same. What does it all amount to? Immigration statistics are an inexact science - and at the moment it's very difficult to know for sure what's going on. line  The figures are the first to include migration estimates following the EU referendum in June.  Nicola White, head of international migration statistics at the ONS, said it was too early to say what effect the referendum has had on long-term migration.  Home Secretary Amber Rudd accepted the government was still far from reaching its net migration target, but said the figures demonstrated we can reduce immigration where we can control it.  She denied a rise in people going back to countries such as Poland reflected an uncertainty among EU citizens living in the UK over their futures.  Ms Rudd said: At the moment we have open immigration with the EU members, freedom of movement, so they can come and go as they want.  I don't see any particularly significant change within EU migration. The real change will be when we leave the EU, and then we will be able to make the choices ourselves what level of immigration we want to have.  And she said that Britain remained open to EU citizens already living here and contributing to the economy, saying: Let's not be in any doubt that the UK will always be a welcoming place for people who want to come here, work here and contribute to our economy.  Sunder Katwala, director of the think-tank British Future, said the figures showed the immigration debate will have to move on in the light of Brexit.  He said: A one-size-fits-all approach to immigration can't help us make the post-Brexit choices that the government and the public now face. Graph of Office for National Statistics data on migration Citizenship levels  Meanwhile, separate figures from the Home Office show that a near-record number of EU nationals were granted British citizenship last year.  Citizenship was given to 16,754 people from EU countries, the second highest since records were first compiled, behind the 17,645 in 2013.  Some 6,498 members of the EU 14 countries - older member states such as France, Spain and Germany - were granted UK citizenship in 2016, up 50% on the previous 12 months and the highest ever for a single year.  A further 6,813 people from the EU 8 countries, which include Poland, gained British citizenship, a rise of 18%, surpassed only by figures for 2013.  Citizenship was given to 3,215 Romanians and Bulgarians, up 20% on 2015 and again only topped by 2013 figures.  Other points within the ONS statistics were:      A fall of 10,000 in people coming to the UK from eight Eastern European countries which joined the EU in 2004, to 58,000     Emigration from the UK of people from these countries was up by 12,000 from September 2015 to 39,000, the highest level in five years     The number of non-EU citizens from Africa, the Americas and Oceania leaving the UK increased by 11,000, to 39,000     The 134,000 people coming to the UK to study was a marked decreased, down by 41,000 from September 2015.

In a tweet, Republican Senator Roy Blunt said he was saddened by the tragic loss of life and that his thoughts were with the families affected by” this horrific attack”.  Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill issued a statement strongly condemning the action and offering support law enforcement personnel looking into the matter.  “Firing upon a crowd of innocent concert goers is an act of unimaginable evil and my deepest condolences go out to all those affected by this tragic event,” said McCaskill. “I will continue to closely monitor the situation and pledge my support to all local, state, and federal law enforcement officials involved in this investigation.”  Republican Lieutenant Governor Mike Parson, a former Sheriff, praised the response of law enforcement to the shooting spree and expressed regret over the occurrence.  “While my words can be of little comfort to the victims of this senseless act of violence, it should bring comfort to all Americans to see the quick response of local law enforcement and first responders to stop the gunman and help victims, and fellow Americans helping to get others to safety,” Parson said. “My deepest sympathies go out to everyone affected.”  Republican Governor Eric Greitens posted a short message on Facebook, saying “Our prayers are with the people affected by last night’s tragic and evil violence in Las Vegas.”  Republican State Representative Nick Marshall of Parkville is a National Rifle Association member and an outspoken supporter of gun rights. Marshall hasn’t released a formal statement, but when reached for comment by Missourinet, was critical of the inquiry and said the Las Vegas shooter’s use of automatic weapons was not a state issue.  “I can’t believe that we would, within hours of a mass shooting, be talking politics on this. That’s the disturbing thing to me right now to hear about. I get a call from someone who wants to talk about politics in a mass shooting,” said Marshall. “When it comes to automatic weapons, that’s a federal issue as you know.”  Marshall went on to stress the involvement of human shortcomings in the incident. “It’s nothing other than a human tragedy for our country. I think what it shows, it shows we’ve got some serious cultural issues, some serious heart issues in the nation.”  After Governor Greitens had metal detectors installed in the state capitol this year and restricted people from entering with guns, Marshall offered his own an alternative.  On his Facebook page and his office door, Marshall posted the message “effective immediately, any constituent of mine with a CCW that was not allowed to bring his firearm into the Capitol may stop by my office and borrow one for the duration of the visit.”  One of the Missouri legislature’s most fierce proponents of gun restrictions is Democratic Representative Stacy Newman of Richmond Heights. She told Missourinet that Marshall wasn’t exactly correct about federal oversight of automatic weapons, citing 2011 legislation passed by state lawmakers known as House Bill 294.  “Part of this omnibus gun bill that year legalizing machine guns in the state of Missouri. We legalized them here. And ever since then, continually my whole time in the legislature, we have loosened restriction.”  Newman also said voters have failed to hold lawmakers responsible for current laws which allow access to rapid fire weapons. “We elect people and then expect them to change their spots when they are in office. They’re not going to do it because they’re answering to the gun lobby. The gun lobby only cares about more sales. That’s it”.  Austin Petersen, a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate seat held by McCaskill, expressed sadness over the shooting and asked for unity in overcoming it.  “I’m heartbroken over the tragic event in Las Vegas yesterday,” Petersen said. “This horrendous act of violence touches and hurts us all as a nation and we must come together to heal and find answers. I send my most sincere condolences to all of the victims and their families. Please help and love one another.”  Petersen has criticized Facebook for banning him from the site for 30 days after he posted a live stream video of himself talking about an AR-15 rifle he’s giving away. An AR-15 is a semi-automatic weapon.  During an interview with Missourinet Columbia affiliate KSSZ, Petersen said ban was politically motivated. “Facebook’s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg has donated the maximum amount allowable to my opponent Claire McCaskill, so something’s fishy.”  At least 58 people have died from Sunday night’s mass shooting in Las Vegas, which also injured more than 500 people",Missouri lawmakers condemn Las Vegas shooting,mixture,
6130328a,"After the Korean Medical Association had called on Seoul to stop the flu vaccination program for a review, South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun finally called for an investigation for the safety issues. This is because the death toll in South Korea after getting flu vaccines has rose to 97; as reported by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency KDCA last week. The KDCA, however, still denies that there is a connection between these seemingly genocidal phenomena and the vaccines being used in the government’s free flu shot program. What’s more disturbing is that the KCDA still urges the SK citizens to continue getting vaccination despite the growing number of dead flu vaccine recipients. To some, this is not surprising for an institution like the KCDA. Such organizations claiming to be in charge of diseases control and prevention, while ironically tainted with conflicts of interest, have been proven to be untrustworthy and deceiving when it comes to science many times in history. For example, a report from Children’s Health Defence CHD website stated the following: “The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC recommends that everyone aged six months and up, including pregnant women, get an annual flu shot to protect against the influenza virus. The mainstream media characterize this recommendation as being firmly grounded in science. The demonstrable truth of the matter, however, is that what the government and media say science says and what science actually tells us are two completely different things.” What’s more diabolical is that they even recommend this flu vaccine to pregnant women! On the same report, the CHD website also wrote: “The CDC’s recommendation that pregnant women get the flu shot is all the more disturbing given the fact that multi-dose vials of the flu vaccine contain the preservative Thimerosal, which is half ethylmercury by weight. Ethylmercury is a known neurotoxin that can cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain. It can also cross the placental barrier and enter the brain of the developing fetus.” Therefore, it is reasonable to think that the flu vaccine being used to the SK citizens has contributed or probably the main cause of death. Even if the manufacturers and the state health departments often deny it, common sense would tell us that substances containing heavy metals such as mercury and aluminium, not to mention dozens of other questionable and alarming agents in the vaccine, are very detrimental and should not be put in a human’s body. For instance, during the last year’s United Nation UN summit regarding vaccination, doctors and other experts admitted that there has been no proof that vaccines are safe and effective. In a report published in the naturalnews.com, Dr. Stephen Evans, a Professor of Pharmacoepidemiology stated in the video: “It seems to me that adjuvants multiply the immunogenicity of the antigens that they are added to, and that is their intention. It seems to me they multiply the reactogenicity vaccine adverse reactions and side effects in many instances, and therefore it seems to me that it is not unexpected if they multiply the incidence of adverse reactions that are associated with the antigen…” Despite the claims by the proponents of vaccines, a peer-reviewed study reveals that unvaccinated people are most protected against influenza flu. In one of its numerous reports about flu vaccines, globalresearch.ca wrote: “At least six separate studies conducted by the same people that are still pushing the flu shot have confirmed that seasonal flu shots make people more prone to contracting the flu. The evidence is now overwhelming that, rather than impart immunity as long claimed, flu shots actually destroy the immune system and increase the risk of infection.” References: Featured image: https://www.fiercepharma.com/vaccines/deaths-rattle-south-korea-s-seasonal-flu-vaccination-but-authority-presses-ahead-free",Flu Vaccine Deaths in South Korea risen to nearly 100; Prime Minister asks for Investigation,mixture,
,"Source: Xinhua| 2021-08-23 22:10:30|Editor: huaxia  Video Player Close  BEIJING, Aug. 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin on Monday urged the United States to stop levelling unwarranted accusations against other countries concerning coronavirus origins tracing and conduct investigations on its own laboratories.  Wang made the remarks at a daily press briefing in response to continuous media focus on the bio-lab in the University of North Carolina (UNC) and Ralph Baric for the former's poor safety record and the latter's techniques in artificial synthesis of coronavirus.  For quite some time, Wang said, the United States has been persistently hyping up the so-called ""Wuhan Institute of Virology lab leak theory"" in disregard of the conclusion in the WHO-China study report that ""a laboratory origin of the pandemic was considered to be extremely unlikely."" It has gone so far as to ask the intelligence community to fabricate a so-called report on origins investigation.  ""However, the United States can not whitewash itself by smearing China. The United States keeps alleging that the virus came from a lab leak, but actually, no one merits a proper investigation more than the United States,"" Wang said.  The United States was the first to start research in recombinant virus and possesses unrivalled strength in this area. It has also funded and conducted more research in coronaviruses than any other country, he said, citing research conducted and interviews given by Baric.  ""An investigation into Baric's team and lab is all it takes to clarify whether coronavirus research can create or has created novel coronavirus,"" Wang said.  He also said the United States has the world's worst bio-lab safety records, citing reports of lab incidents involving genetically engineered organisms by the University of North Carolina, and the fact key details like the nature of the genetic modifications and how the incidents were handled were deliberately deleted from incident reports.  Baric collaborates closely with the two institutes involved in research on high-risk viruses and coronaviruses at Fort Detrick, the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), and the Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick (IRF-Frederick), he added.  Wang said the United States has been going to great lengths to try to prove that the novel coronavirus was leaked from the Wuhan lab. However, WHO experts have paid two visits there and concluded that a lab leak from a Wuhan lab is extremely unlikely.  ""I wonder when the United States plans to invite WHO experts to investigate the UNC bio-lab and USAMRIID? We suggest that the United States stop slinging mud at others and instead find out what happened in its own labs first,"" said the spokesperson.

Meanwhile, Chapman University has released a survey of the top ten issues Americans fear the most. Guess what? Climate change didn’t make the list. Instead, corruption of politicians was the No. 1 worry. For those who don’t see the relationship between these two newsworthy events, let me connect the dots for you. Global warming and climate change, even if it is 100% caused by humans, is so slow that it cannot be observed by anyone in their lifetime. Hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts and other natural disasters have yet to show any obvious long-term change. This means that in order for politicians to advance policy goals (such as forcing expensive solar energy on the masses or creating a carbon tax), they have to turn normal weather disasters into “evidence” of climate change. As a climate researcher, I will agree that humans have likely contributed to a portion of recent warmth. I am not a denier of either natural or human-induced climate change. But the observed warming as monitored by satellites (our only truly global monitoring system) has been only about half of what computerized climate models say should be happening. Furthermore, the overall increases in such things as hurricanes and tornadoes have not materialized. Drought in the western U.S. pales in comparison to the mega-droughts tree rings tell us existed in centuries past. Lake-bottom sediments in Florida tell us that recent major hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico has been less frequent than in centuries past. Strong Sandy-type storms occur every year in all the major ocean basins… they just don’t happen to hit major metropolitan areas. It has now, even after Hurricane Matthew, been over 4,000 days since a major hurricane (Category 3 or stronger) has made landfall in the U.S. Sea level rise, which was occurring long before humans could be blamed, has not accelerated and still amounts to only 1 inch every ten years. If a major hurricane is approaching with a predicted storm surge of 10-14 feet, are you really going to worry about a sea level rise of 1 inch per decade? If Hillary would have fact-checked her example of sea level rise in Norfolk, Virginia, she would have found out that the experts already know this is mostly due to the land there sinking. To the extent that the cost of weather disasters has risen over time, that is well known to be the result of modern society building more infrastructure in areas that are prone to damage from weather—which is almost everywhere. So, to keep the masses alarmed, politicians must claim that what is normal is actually abnormal—and getting worse. And, furthermore, that only they can fix it … and thereby save your children and grandchildren. And it is that “fix” that really sinks any current plan politicians have to address climate change. Even the modern godfather of global warming, ex-NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies director James Hansen, has admitted that the Paris climate agreement is “a fraud really, a fake.” This is because even if the countries of the world agree to do what they promised on climate change, and that climate change is entirely our fault, and that climate change really will ultimately get bad, the promised actions will have no measurable effect on future global temperatures. You see, many of those countries that have signed on to the Paris Agreement aren’t signing up to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. They are signing up for wealth transfers from the minority of advanced countries to the majority of poor countries. And you can’t even fix the problem with a new agreement. Why? Because until we develop a practical, cost-competitive alternative to fossil fuels, it is unlikely that renewable energy will ever make up more than 15-20% of global energy requirements. The amount of energy necessary for humans to do everything we do is simply too large. As that demand for energy grows, the amount of renewable energy also has to grow, just to maintain only a 15-20% fraction of the total. So, until people actually experience climate change, and new energy technologies are developed, any claims by politicians that we are in a “climate crisis” will fall on deaf ears. And since the biggest risk to humanity is poverty, if we allow policymakers to have their way, the resulting energy poverty will indeed cause the deaths of some of our children and grandchildren.",Hillary Clinton Boards The Climate Crisis Train To Nowhere,mixture,

Liz Truss predicts that Britain’s economy will grow by £3.4 billion when a deal is signed, with the North East, Midlands and Scotland seeing the biggest uplift.  Boris Johnson said Britain will “drive a hard bargain” when it unveils its negotiating objectives on Monday. Talks will begin later this month, running in parallel with UK-EU trade negotiations.

Among the sectors predicted to get the biggest boost from a transatlantic free trade agreement are ceramics factories, the car industry, food and drinks producers and professional services.  Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Ms Truss says: “More container ships will leave Liverpool, Glasgow and Belfast stacked high with UK goods, more British-made cars will travel on US highways and sub-Atlantic cables will buzz with the digital ingenuity of the UK’s soaring tech sector.  “It’s there for the taking, as are the benefits that this kind of expansion in our trading relationship can bring for people in every part of the UK.”",Workers 'to share in £1.8billion pay rise' if US trade deal comes off,mixture,

4854c659,"“Global warming” is a myth — so say 80 graphs from 58 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in 2017.  In other words, the so-called “Consensus” on global warming is a massive lie. And Donald Trump was quite right to quit the Paris agreement which pretended that the massive lie was true.  By “global warming” these papers don’t, of course, mean the mild warming of around 0.8 degrees Celsius that the planet has experienced since the middle of the 19th century as the world crawled out of the Little Ice Age. Pretty much everyone, alarmists and skeptics alike, is agreed on that.  Rather, they mean “global warming” in the sense that is most commonly used today by grant-troughing scientists, and huxter politicians, and scaremongering green activists, and brainwashed mainstream media (MSM) environmental correspondents. “Global warming” as in the scary, historically unprecedented, primarily man-made phenomenon which we must address urgently before the icecaps melt and the Pacific islands disappear beneath the waves and all the baby polar bears drown.  What all these papers argue in their different ways is that the alarmist version of global warming — aka Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming (CAGW) — is a fake artefact.  That is, all these different experts from around the world — China, Russia, Canada, the U.S., Italy, etc. — have been looking closely at different aspects of the global warming puzzle in various regions and on different timescales and come to the conclusion in irreproachable, peer-reviewed scientific ways that there is no evidence to support the global warming scare story.  Late 20th century and early 21st century global warming, they show, is neither dramatic, nor unusual, nor scary.  Here, as collated by Kenneth Richard at No Tricks Zone, are just some of the charts to prove it.  Büntgen et al, below, shows that temperatures in the northern hemisphere were warmer in the early 1400s than they are today  Abrantes et al (below) confirms the traditional view — which Michael Mann tried to dismiss with his discredited Hockey Stick chart — that the Medieval Warming Period was warmer than anything we have experienced in our own era.  Here’s one from Li et al showing that China was much warmer 8,000 years ago  Here’s an unusual one from Guillet et al suggesting that there’s nothing new about wildly early or late grape harvests through the centuries:  And on and on it goes — there are 80 graphs in all, each showing in its different way why the scare about global warming has been horribly overdone because the evidence just doesn’t support its being unusual or a problem. Several of the papers note that the primary influence on warming appears to be solar activity. Few, if any, entertain the notion that carbon dioxide levels have much to do with it.  The intellectually corrupt and mendacious alarmist science establishment — I’m thinking, for example, of my personal bete noir, the left-wing political activist and Nobel-prizewinning geneticist Sir Paul Nurse, former president of the Royal Society — would have us believe that climate skepticism is a minority activity, the preserve of a few cranks, championed only by people who don’t do the science. But this is just ugly propaganda.  Here are dozens of reputable scientists from around the world with no axe to grind collaborating on studies which all corroborate, independently and rigorously, the increasingly respectable view that “man-made global warming” just isn’t a thing.  Not that it ever was a thing, really. This debate — as I argue at some length in Watermelons — was always about left-wing ideology, quasi-religious hysteria, and “follow the money” corruption, never about “science.”  Still, it’s always a comfort to know that “the science” is on our side too.  They do so hate that fact, the Greenies.","DELINGPOLE: ‘Global Warming’ Is a Myth, Say 58 Scientific Papers in 2017",mixture,
43daeaa5,"The recent drought has highlighted the pressure that a changing climate puts on a snowpack-dependent water system. With the shift toward more rain rather than snow, and the earlier melting of the snowpack, water managers need to release water more frequently for flood control. This dynamic is playing out in Oroville now, with the state’s water managers racing to empty water from the dam’s reservoir in advance of storms forecast to arrive Wednesday. Because these storms are relatively warm, they are likely to bring rain to the surrounding mountains, speeding the flow of water behind the dam.  The juxtaposition of five years of hot, dry conditions followed by more rain than reservoirs can store may seem incongruous. However, this is exactly what climate scientists have predicted for California since at least the 1980s: protracted periods of warm, dry conditions punctuated by intense wet spells, with more rain and less snow, causing both drought and floods. Recent work from my lab shows that in fact this pattern is already emerging, with the conditions that create extremely warm dry years and extremely wet years both becoming more frequent.  The other bitter reality is that this extremely wet winter will not wash away the drought. Depending where one looks, California lost out on one to three full years of precipitation from 2012 to 2016. That is a lot of water to make up in one year, and as of last week almost half of California was still in a state of drought. The moisture deficits that have accumulated during the drought have not been seen in our lifetimes. They have caused thousands of California residents to go without running water, resulted in groundwater contamination and permanent loss of aquifer storage capacity, and have severely stressed tens of millions of trees. As a result, even after this wet year, rural communities, groundwater aquifers and forest ecosystems will still feel the effects of the drought.  As the last five years illustrate, California’s water system is not equipped for climate change’s “new normal.” That water system must simultaneously provide for the country’s largest population and agricultural sector, and one of its most diverse natural environments. Although California has greatly improved water-use efficiency in the last half-century, climate change is pushing our water system to the limit. Investments in “climate smart” infrastructure can ensure the safety and security of Americans in the face of climate stresses now and in the future. These investments in infrastructure upgrades and expansion would create jobs, protect communities from disasters and help prepare us for changes in the climate. This effort would have several key elements:  First, given the new climate normal in which protracted hot, dry periods are far more common, we need to deploy technologies that can increase water supply. While expensive, energy-intensive desalination options have received considerable attention, wastewater recycling technologies have improved to the point that clean, safe water can now be delivered at reduced energy cost and can even be an energy source by using the organic matter in wastewater to produce energy. Investments in infrastructure to capture, store and clean urban storm water will also create new sources of water supply.",What California’s Dam Crisis Says About the Changing Climate - The New York Times,mixture,
803bdfbf,"This really should be one of the biggest public health scandals of the decade, but instead it’s given little attention – mainly because of the high-profile nature of the people and organisations involved. *** The United Nations has been forced to admit that a major international vaccine initiative is actually causing a deadly outbreak of the very disease it was supposed to wipe-out. While international organisations like the World Health Organization WHO will regularly boast about ‘eradicating polio’ with vaccines—the opposite seems to be the case, with vaccines causing the deaths of scores of young people living in Africa. Health officials have now admitted that their plan to stop ‘wild’ polio is backfiring, as scores children are being paralyzed by a deadly strain of the pathogen derived from a live vaccine – causing a virulent wave of polio to spread. This latest pharma-induced pandemic started out in the African countries of Chad and Sudan, with the culprit identified as vaccine-derived polio virus type 2. Officials now fear this new dangerous strain could soon ‘jump continents,’ causing further deadly outbreaks around the world. Shocking as it sounds, this Big Pharma debacle is not new. After spending some $16 billion over 30 years to eradicate polio, international health bodies have ‘accidentally’ reintroduced the disease to in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and also Iran, as the central Asia region was hit by a virulent strain of polio spawned by the a pharmaceutical vaccine. Also, in 2019, the government of Ethiopia ordered the destruction of 57,000 vials of type 2 oral polio vaccine mOPV2 following a similar outbreak of vaccine-induced polio. The same incident has happened in India as well. It’s important to note that the oral polio vaccine is being pushed by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative GPEI, a consortium which is supported and funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. All of this should be cause for concern, especially with western governments and transnational pharmaceutical giants all rushing to roll-out their new Gates-funded experimental coronavirus vaccine for the global population. Currently, the first experimental COVID-19 vaccine is being tested on the African populationthrough GAVI Vaccine Alliance, another organization funded by the Gates Foundation. A large round of human trials is taking place in South Africa, run by the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg—another Gates-funded institution. This latest revelation from Africa should prompt journalists and health advocates to ask harder questions about the efficacy and safety of the much-hype COVID ‘miracle’ vaccine. AP News reports… LONDON AP — The World Health Organization says a new polio outbreak in Sudan is linked to an ongoing vaccine-sparked epidemic in Chad — a week after the U.N. health agency declared the African continent free of the wild polio virus. In a statement this week, WHO said two children in Sudan — one from South Darfur state and the other from Gedarif state, close to the border with Ethiopia and Eritrea — were paralyzed in March and April. Both had been recently vaccinated against polio. WHO said initial outbreak investigations show the cases are linked to an ongoing vaccine-derived outbreak in Chad that was first detected last year and is now spreading in Chad and Cameroon. “There is local circulation in Sudan and continued sharing of transmission with Chad,” the U.N. agency said, adding that genetic sequencing confirmed numerous introductions of the virus into Sudan from Chad. WHO said it had found 11 additional vaccine-derived polio cases in Sudan and that the virus had also been identified in environmental samples. There are typically many more unreported cases for every confirmed polio patient. The highly infectious disease can spread quickly in contaminated water and most often strikes children under 5. In rare instances, the live polio virus in the oral vaccine can mutate into a form capable of sparking new outbreaks. Last week, WHO and partners declared that the African continent was free of the wild polio virus, calling it “an incredible and emotional day.” On Monday, WHO warned that the risk of further spread of the vaccine-derived polio across central Africa and the Horn of Africa was “high,” noting the large-scale population movements in the region. More than a dozen African countries are currently battling outbreaks of polio caused by the virus, including Angola, Congo, Nigeria and Zambia. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, many of the large-scale vaccination campaigns needed to stamp out polio have been disrupted across Africa and elsewhere, leaving millions of children vulnerable to infection. In April, WHO and its partners reluctantly recommended a temporary halt to mass polio immunization campaigns, recognizing the move could lead to a resurgence of the disease. In May, they reported that 46 campaigns to vaccinate children against polio had been suspended in 38 countries, mostly in Africa, because of the coronavirus pandemic. Some of the campaigns have recently been re-started, but health workers need to vaccinate more than 90% of children in their efforts to eradicate the paralytic disease. Health officials had initially aimed to wipe out polio by 2000, a deadline repeatedly pushed back and missed. Wild polio remains endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan; both countries also are struggling to contain outbreaks of vaccine-derived polio. * Note to readers: please click the share buttons above or below.

But, for CBC TV in Canada, the following scene was too much, and had to be removed from their broadcast of the film:  That’s right, ComicBook.com reports that CBC edited out Donald Trump’s cameo from the 1992 movie. And people watching it were quick to report the suspicious omission on social media. Some were outraged, and the snowflakes were thrilled.

One could argue that Trump wasn’t a political figure in the public’s conscious before 2015, but years prior he had been making headlines for publicly questioning Obama’s birth certificate—so I don’t think that excuse really works. Had his cameo been cut before then, I’m sure it would have been noticed.  Trump’s presidential bid appears to be the beginning of the folks at the CBC being triggered by Trump so badly that they actually had to edit him out of their broadcast of the film.

2d0f41d8,"WHEELING — At least $53 million a week in illegal drugs cross the Mexican border into the U.S. each week, and more border agents are needed at the U.S.-Mexican border to stop this, according to U.S. Rep. David B. McKinley.  McKinley, R-W.Va., recently traveled to the U.S.-Mexican border to learn about the issue there first hand. He visited the McAllen, Texas region in the Rio Grande District of the U.S. Border Patrol.  He commended the work of the border agents.  “They put themselves in danger and try to keep the border clean and secure. They’ve done that for decades,” McKinley said. “What has compounded this is the humanitarian crisis. We didn’t always have so many people trying to cross illegally.”  The agents attempt to still do their security job, put many are being pulled off the line to take care of the humanitarian crisis.  While at the border, McKinley learned a Mexican drug cartel controls happenings at the border.  He spoke with immigrants detained at the border who told him they paid the cartel anywhere from $3,000 to $9,000 to get them across the border. Often, part of the deal is that the immigrant carry illegal drugs with them on the journey.  If the immigrants are captured, they are sent back to their village and must start over again and seek help from the cartel, McKinley said.  “One of the border officers said they the cartel might be making as much money on this as they are on drugs,” he said.  Border guards have a lot of tools to help track immigrants crossing into the U.S., even if they don’t have the manpower to stop all of them, according to McKinley.  The entire U.S.-Mexico border is about 2,000 miles long, while the Rio Grande District agents focus on a specific 300-mile area. Sections of the Rio Grande River are narrow, and often the water is so low immigrants can walk across it. Border guards showed McKinley the footsteps in the mud where some had walked across the night before.  Where there isn’t a wall, cameras and sensors are placed to indicate when an immigrant is coming across the border.  But the cartel knows when agents could be as far as 10 miles away from a possible passage and unable to stop it. That’s when they help immigrants cross into the U.S., according to McKinley.  Nearly a million immigrants were stopped at the border before entering the U.S. last year, he said. Rio Grande District agents were responsible for 399,000 of the arrests, but they know from their technology they missed at least 47,000 immigrants in their crossing.  Many of these immigrants entering the U.S. carried opioids, according to McKinley.  “Border agents say you’ve got to pay attention to this — $53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs,” he said.  To compare, the state of West Virginia recently received $28 million for opioid rehabilitation, treatment and education.  “Almost twice that amount comes across the border each week — to put it into perspective,” McKinley said.",Rep.

Navy Yard. A news conference is set to begin any minute now. We will bring it to you as soon ass underway. But here, 13 hours after those people were shot and killed, police say they are still working on identifying those victims and notifying their families. Three victims of the shooting, including one police officer, remain hospitalized tonight. But doctors expect those three to recover fully from their wounds. Navy Commander Tim Jirus was actually speaking to one of the victims when he was shot. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CMDR. TIM JIRUS, U.S. NAVY: There`s an individual who came from the building behind us, I mean, this building. He came up and was talking to me, basically saying, hey, there`s a shooter in your building. Then I heard two more shots. One of them hit him. He went down in front of me and I took off from there. REPORTER: The guy you were with? JIRUS: The guy I was talking to. REPORTER: Got shot? JIRUS: Correct. REPORTER: And what was his situation afterwards? Did you move or did you try to assess? JIRUS: He was shot in the head. He did not look like he made it. So, I run from there. I don`t know if he was aiming for him or aiming for me. But I got out of there as soon as I could afterwards. I realized I couldn`t do anything else for him.

Aaron Alexis previously served in the Navy Reserves between May 2007 and January 2011. Here is how Washington, D.C. police Chief Cathy Lanier described the scene. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHIEF CATHY LANIER, DC POLICE: It certainly was one of the worst things we have seen in Washington, D.C. As officers entered the building and moved to the building, they were making transmissions and keeping commanders informed of what they were coming across as they went through, multiple victims. There was gunfire still going on. This is what we trained for. We were able to pull active shooter teams together and compliments to the partners here in the national capital region. We were able to pull officers from different agencies, put them in a single team and get them into the building within seven minutes.

What is it that we expect to learn at this hour? KASIE HUNT, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: At this point, it`s not definitive what we`re going to actually hear. But at this hour we`re really waiting for the sad accounting for the victims. We still don`t have a full picture of how many people died, although officials have said at least 13 civilians and we haven`t begun to understand who they are and go through that grieving process. So, at this hour, just a few blocks from where we are, there are still, by all accounts, thousands of people inside the Navy Yard waiting to be bussed out. The FBI has been talking with those who actually did have some connection with the event before they have been letting them out. They have been bussing people over to nationals park where there was supposed to be a baseball game tonight. So, we are still getting the full picture from people who were actually witnesses to what happened today. I did speak with one man who was nearby and who said they barricaded he and nine of his colleagues barricaded themselves inside a conference room. At one point, the ceiling was sprayed with bullets, and he said, while he didn`t see any casualties on his way out, he did hear from somebody that he knew that one of his friends, somebody he`d served with at the Pentagon had, in fact, been killed. So, at this point, we`re on hour almost 14 of sorting through exactly what happened today and still no real end to this terrible day for all of these people here -- Lawrence.

GINGER GIBSON, POLITICO: I was at Nationals Stadium earlier today. As Kasie pointed out, it was supposed to have a baseball game, instead, it`s being used as a place where they a reunited families. A lot of families confused. A lot of families still looking for the woman whose mother was working inside the building where the shooting was. She was able to get in touch with her through a co-worker`s cell phone to a neighbor, but unable to get text messages or calls right away. A lot of people were texting assured that their family member was safe but still very worried, very nervous, not knowing what was going to happen next. And, you know, there are lots of people on the Navy Yard, still waiting to be able to go home. And their family members don`t know when they will get to see them next. They can`t drive their car. They don`t have any other way to get home for some of them. So, there is a lot of confusion and a lot of people trying to sort out what exactly took place. O`DONNELL: The latest update we have from law enforcement sources in Washington indicates that they have located the suspect`s rental car in the garage across the street from the building where the shooting occurred. The authorities are in the process of obtaining warrants to search that car and to search the hotel rooms of the suspect and his fellow contractors at the southwest Washington, D.C. residents` inn, where those contractors were staying. The same law enforcement sources said that it appeared that Alexis entered the building armed and one of the first persons shot was the security guard at the entrance. It is believed that he then took that guard`s side arm and either picked up the assault rifle from a safe or cabinet nearby, or also the guard may also have had a long gun with him. Kasie, this is one of the mysteries of the day, is it seems that the shooter ended up with three weapons but probably didn`t start with three weapons. HUNT: Absolutely. And there`s also been over the course of the day, as you remember questions about how many active shooters there were at any given time. And then you had police even confused, or not necessarily confused but warning the general public and reporters who were gathered outside the scene here that there could be more than one suspect in this case. We have since learned that it was just this, they believe now it was just confined to this one active shooter. We are starting to get some, as you outline, details more of where the guns came from. My colleague Michael Isikoff points out that a source told him that he would have passed a criminal background check to get the gun that he may have brought on to the premises himself. O`DONNELL: Let`s listen to what the suspect`s brother-in-law said earlier tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTHONY LITTLE, BROTHER-IN-LAW OF ALLEGED GUNMAN: Their initial reaction, I was not here for, but when I got here they were very distraught, stressed out, tears. They didn`t see it coming. It`s very hurtful. The hearts are going out more to the victims, the people that got hurt. (END VIDEO CLIP) O`DONNELL: Ginger Gibson, I don`t want to read too much into that, but he doesn`t seem completely shocked. I mean, just says didn`t see it coming. But there`s -- I don`t hear a comment there about this is unimaginable. You know, he -- we would think he would never do something like this. GIBSON: We`re going to be waiting to hear maybe tonight the details of what happened inside that building or in the morning. But the more difficult part and the part we all want to know is why. How did he get to a point where he could do something like this? Listening to what the brother had to say. I know there are folks in Texas talking to friends, former roommates, co-workers, trying to put together those pieces is going to be difficult to try to grasp. We all want to grasp what would make someone do such a horrific thing. The brother-in-law didn`t seem too surprised but we have to remember, too, that shock is at play here. It`s very difficult to try to put together in such a short amount of time why and how someone could do something like this. O`DONNELL: We`re joined now by NBC News national investigative correspondent. Michael, what is your understanding of the latest version of where we are? MICHAEL ISIKOFF, NBC NEWS NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: Well, the latest version is, as you just reported, the rental car has been located across the street in the garage. And law enforcement authorities are trying to get the search warrant to search those. But there`s still, you know, the big unanswered question here is why. Motive has not yet been established. The closest that I have seen, Lawrence, are the interviews with the friends who talk about that he had some sort of beef with the contracting firm that had employed him, didn`t feel he was being paid, and was ticked off at them, and then also had this propensity for violent games, that I think one of his friends or acquaintances described him as obsessed with violent video games. Now, we heard that before with Adam Lanza and the Newtown shooting. But, you know, it`s still a far cry from playing those video games to committing an atrocity like this. So, it`s fair to say there`s a lot of unanswered questions. Just a couple of points on access to the base. We did get this statement tonight from Hewlett-Packard confirming that Alexis had been employed by a subcontracting firm called The Experts, which was part of an HP contract to refresh equipment used on the Navy Marine Corps intranet network. Apparently, that involved installing new PCs when they went down and refreshing them, replacing them. But that did apparently give him access to the base and might explain how he got in there in the first place. O`DONNELL: We`re still waiting for the latest update from a press conference that Casey Hunt is attending. And, Michael, the -- there is information that has been developed now in the last few hours saying that this suspect had been treated multiple times for psychological issues, including sleep deprivation, anger, paranoia. Most recently, they said he had been treated at a V.A. hospital in New England, Rhode Island, possibly Massachusetts. So we are still in the process of developing this psychological profile. ISIKOFF: Exactly. There is clearly a lot that we don`t know. We do know we found that he had this arrest record. He had been arrested on misdemeanor charges in September of 2010, which is just a few months before his discharge from the Navy. It`s worth pointing out that the charges were dropped and they would not have been a barrier to him buying the weapon. We know that he -- or weapons. We know that or believe that he did purchase this shotgun in northern Virginia just -- northern Virginia, not far from Washington D.C. But nothing that we know of in his background would have prevented him from doing that or passing a background check. O`DONNELL: Michael, I have to interrupt you. We are going to a press conference. The mayor is about to speak. MAYOR VINCENT GRAY (D), WASHINGTON, D.C.: We will follow the same order of presentation that we did earlier. I will be followed by Chief Lanier, who will be followed by our FBI Washington director, and then Chief Chambers and Congresswoman Norton. We don`t have a great deal of new information to present to you at this point. I think we mentioned earlier that we had ruled out one of the suspects. No longer being a suspect. We continue to pursue the possibility of there being another shooter. We don`t have any evidence, any indication at this stage that there was yet another shooter even though we haven`t completely ruled that out. That was the person as you probably will recall who was identified as wearing an olive, drab uniform -- somebody around 55 years of age, around 5`10"", with graying sideburns. We have not identified that person nor do we have a lot of corroborating evidence. And maybe Valerie will talk a little bit about that, too, when she comes up. We don`t know what the motive is at the stage. We were asked earlier if there was likely terrorism involved. We have no indication of that. We haven`t ruled that out. We continue to investigate that. We know that there are 13 fatalities, including the shooter who perished today. We do have more information now on the decedents. Their ages are 46 years of age to 73 years of age. The families now are still in the process of being notified. Seven families have been notified and the process continues to notify the other six. We don`t know exactly when that process will be completed, but it is continuing now as we speak. I also want to update the issue around injuries. We didn`t have precise numbers earlier. We were using estimates. We now know that there are eight people who incurred one or another kind of injury. Of the eight, three were shot. They all are -- that includes Officer Scott Williams who the chief and I just went to visit earlier this evening who is doing well. He is in great spirits. There were two other civilians who were shot and they are relative minor injuries. The other five injuries range anywhere from stress action and someone who fell and had head injury, a contusion chest, arm abrasions and chest pain. So, again, a total of eight injuries, people who were hospitalized as a result of those and there`s absolutely no reason to think that there won`t be fined. One other point before I turn it over to Chief Lanier. We anticipate tomorrow morning that the traffic patterns will be back to normal in the city. All the bridges will be open, all the streets in the area of the Navy Yard will be open, even as the investigation, of course, will be continuing tomorrow and the days ahead. Again we have been in close contact with the White House. They`ve been a close contact with us and the president has reached out. His staff and the president through them have reached out to connect with us as this process has unfolded throughout the day. So again, this is a horrific tragedy. I want to thank all of the first responders who have done a terrific job dealing with this horrific tragedy. Our police officers and various law enforcement agencies that have done a sterling job, and I want to especially thank fire and emergency medical services for the work that they have done today as well. They had obviously many transports that they had to make and they did an extraordinary job doing that. And Chief Eleve (ph), where are you, Chief? I want to thank you for the work that you did today in order to be able to handle that important responsibility. So, with that having been said, let me ask Chief Lanier to come up and share some things with you -- Chief. LANIER: Thank you. I`ll pick up where the mayor left off. I can`t say enough about the first responders. All the training, exercising and daily interaction that we have here with more than 30 law enforcement agencies of some type in the district. The team work as we hear story after story and having been on the scene and listening to transmissions throughout the course of the day, 24 years doing this in the city. I`m very proud of the team work. The ability to quickly pull together to spare the teams of law enforcement, the heroic efforts, United States Park Police working with Metropolitan Police Department quickly entering the building along with security from the Navy Yard, as well as support from partners quickly brought in mutual aid, Maryland state and park police helicopters, as well as Fairfax, to see three difference jurisdictions had less than 45 minutes to coordinate emergency response, whether it`d be fire, emergency, medical, support from Prince Gorges County brought to DC fire EMS, to medevac support brought in through United States park police and their medevac, just incredible work. United States Marshall Service entering buildings with teams of MPD. Also, NCIS who assisted in picking up and carrying an injured police officer out of the building, story after story, we`ve heard from police officers and firefighters just terrific responses and thank you for all of the local and regional partners who responded. I will say Metro Transit as well. The special recognition that really stepped up today to help us get large numbers of victims and survivors to various places that we needed to transport witnesses, never had to ask for any support. They are always there to provide what we need so we really appreciate the work of Metro Transit. As of right now with the last outstanding lookout that we had for the potential last person connected to the deceased shooter, that was a lookout we put out for a black male between the ages of 40 and 50 in an olive drab uniform. Obviously, we had multiple witness accounts that we were sorting through. We have now exhausted all means that we have available to either support or discount that lookout. And we are comfortable at this point to lift the shelter in place to the residents of the neighborhood. Thank them first of all, residents and businesses, for supporting us and sheltering in place for an extended period of time, but we feel comfortable right now that we have exhausted all means to eliminate that possible last suspect. So, we do now feel comfortable that we have the single and sole person responsible for the loss of life inside of the base today. If anything changes, as we continue to go forward we certainly will make that available to the public. But again we are lifting the shelter in place and we appreciate the support from our community members. We will most likely have all of the traffic closures around the area open by 5:00 a.m. for morning commute. But we will make sure that is put out for the public in advance. Listen to your local news media before you come to work in the morning. And as of right now, we have, as we go through finalizing next of kin. We have identified one D.C. resident so far that are among the victims. So, in terms of our outreach in local community, our hearts go out to all of the victims certainly and at least one of our victims we have confirmed as a D.C. resident. At this point, we don`t have anything to support that any of the victims so far identified are active duty military. We have civilian and contractors so far that have been identified. We still have some work to do, but no active military have been identified amongst the victims at this point. So, with that, I will turn it over to the assistant director of the FBI, Val Parlave, and let her update you on their investigation. VALERIE PARLAVE, FBI: Good evening. As we have stated, this continues to be a very active investigation. The FBI`s evidence response teams continue to process the shooting scenes. These teams have special capabilities to include bullet trajectory analysis and crime scene mapping. We continue to follow every lead related to the shootings, to include piecing together the movement and activities of Aaron Alexis. While we have learned some information about his recent whereabouts, we continue to work to determine where he has been, who he has talked to, and what he has done. This includes determining the origins of the weapons he used, but because this investigation still continues, we will not comment further on the weapons used in today`s shooting. We can confirm, however that Mr. Alexis had legitimate access to the Navy Yard as result of his work as a contractor. And he utilized a valid pass to gain entry to the Navy Yard. We continue to work to identify and locate additional witnesses to today`s events and any individuals who may have information about Mr. Alexis. We appreciate the information provided so far by the public and we continue to ask for any and all information related to Mr. Alexis and today`s tragic events. Please report this information by calling 1-800- CALL-FBI. That`s 1-800-225-5324. And we again thank the public for your cooperation and will continue to update you on this investigation as it progresses. Thank you. CHIEF TERESA CHAMBERS, PARK POLICE: And simply from the United States Park Police. You heard Chief Lanier talk about team. We were part of that team this morning. We now have a more subordinate role, but we commit to her and to Assistant Director Parlave and the mayor that we will provide whatever resources available and appropriate to help complete this investigation. Thank you. DEL. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON (D), WASHINGTON, DC: Thank you more mayor for bringing us to this last report to the city and to the region. As in the beginning, our thoughts are with the victims and their families and they will also be our first thoughts tomorrow when Congress reconvenes and I go on the floor to lead moments of silence. We`re not going to be silent about the tragedy that occurred here today. There are many outstanding questions. I would say most of the questions are outstanding. For many of us in this city who have been plagued by gun violence, among them is how someone, whatever his badge, managed to get a high powered gun into one of the most secure facilities in the District of Columbia. I`m sure the Navy will be doing its own investigation. Tomorrow I will be working with others to get an independent investigation of what occurred here. I`m very, very proud and very grateful for the federal and D.C. police who responded so promptly. They have made the District of Columbia since 9/11, the most protected and secure city in the United States. But we do not fool ourselves. We understand that in an open and democratic and free society, you cannot make yourselves impenetrable, especially when there are more guns than there are people in the United States today. We take very seriously security at one of our most secure facilities is penetrated and where the security is breached. But we also regard the Naval Sea System Command as a neighbor, a part of this residential mixed use neighborhood. And we like it that way. I appreciate -- continue to appreciate the banquet room they built so that they could accommodate residents. And I`ll be working with the Navy and the Naval Sea System Command to maintain the relationship with the neighborhood while shoring up the security here in the neighborhood and at the facility. Thank you very much. GRAY: All right. We will take a few questions. REPORTER: Question to the special agent in charge, can you just characterize the (INAUDIBLE) PARLAVE: There is still quite a bit of work left to do inside, processing the scene. I would expect them to be there for the next couple of days finishing up. It took us a while to clear the building with our tactical teams and they haven`t actually been in there that long, processing the evidence on scene. So, I would say, you know, 48 hours wouldn`t be unreasonable. REPORTER: There are a lot of people still left in there, the Navy Yard? PARLAVE: I believe most of the people who were alive have been cleared from the Navy Yard. REPORTER: All civilians and contractors were among casualties. Do you have any belief that the shooter was intentionally avoiding shooting military personnel? PARLAVE: We have no information right now as to motive. REPORTER: The congresswoman was talking about bringing a high powered weapon into the building, into the yard. Is there any sense that the suspect was able to lift any of the weapons off of the victims? PARLAVE: That is part of the ongoing investigation and I can`t comment on that. REPORTER: There have been reports that a rental car has been found near the scene that belong to the gunman. Can you confirm? PARLAVE: We are processing vehicle at the scene related to the shooting. REPORTER: Are there reports of other officers injured in the Navy guards on base or park place -- LANIER: We do have one park officer with injuries, not a gun shot injury, but other related injuries to the incident. I believe we do have one contract, I believe contract security working with the naval district of Washington. We will confirm as we go forward, but I do believe we do have at least one. (INAUDIBLE) LANIER: He`s in very good spirits. His family is here, parents, brothers and sisters. He has been on the department 23, almost 24 years. In fact, came on right about the time I did. We worked together for many, many years. He is a K-9 officer. He`s in very good spirits. He`s got a pretty serious injury, but right now, his family is here with him and he is in good spirits. The mayor was up visiting with him as well and he was certainly very complimentary of the partner agencies who helped to get him out of the building and D.C. Fire and EMS helped to get him medical attention that he needed. He is just very grateful for all the other responders that helped to get him out of the building and get him the medical attention he needed. But great police officer. I have known him for most of his 23 years and he`s got a stellar record. REPORTER: Chief, why did you think there was a second shooter and why is that not so? LANIER: Well, obviously, the more information that we can put out, as time goes on. But we always err on the side of caution through conglomeration of witness victim interviews, some camera views. There was potential that there could have been other shooters involved and we believed that the best action for us to take was to make sure our community was safe first. And we weeded through that information, secondly. We certainly want to clear the community as quickly as possible but we would rather err on the side of caution so we did that. And we have spent the last several hours trying to go through everything possible to make sure that we were 100 percent comfortable that we had cleared that information and get it out as quickly as possible. So, again, sometimes we ask for a little bit of patience from our community but our goal is to make sure that everybody is safe and that there is no additional harm. And that`s our goal, no addition harm once we arrive on the scene. GRAY: Last question, last question. REPORTER: At one point (INAUDIBLE) LANIER: No, there will be a press release put out following this event. I believe that is already completed. So, those victims that have been identified, confirmed and notified will release that following. This press briefing, I believe it is here with us so we can hand that out. And as the next of kin are notified, we`ll put out the remainder. GRAY: Thank you all very much. O`DONNELL: Michael Isikoff, so there we have the investigation conclusion at this stage that the suspect that was killed today is as the police chief put it, the single and sole person responsible. ISIKOFF: Right. And one piece of new information that is worth noting here is that he did have a valid pass and legitimate access to the Navy yard in his capacity as a contractor. And what is interesting about that, Lawrence, he was working, according to the statement we got from Hewlett Packard on this Navy Marine Corps intranet network, which is a clues network, which does suggest that there would classified work involved. And in order to do that, the presumption would be, he would have to have some sort of security clearance and have undergone some sort of background check. Now, we have not confirmed what level that is or what sort of background checking underwent. But to work on a closed military network like that would normally require that kind of clearance, some sort of clearance. So, I think there is g to be an addition to the questions that Congresswoman Norton raised about the billing to purchase the weapon. And as I put it up before, we have no felony conviction that we know of in his background. There is, I think additional questions about what sort of background check he underwent to get this job. O`DONNELL: Michael Isikoff, thanks very much for joining us tonight. ISIKOFF: Thank you. O`DONNELL: Coming up, the chief medical officer of the hospital that took in the wounded joins me. And who the extraordinary press conference today, Dr. Janis Orlowski forced us to think about why these kinds of shootings keep happening in America. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DOCTOR JANIS ORLOWSKI, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, MEDSTAR WASHINGTON: I`m Doctor Janis Orlowski. I`m the chief medical officer at MedStar Washington hospital center. I`m here to give you an update regarding the three individuals brought to the hospital center. (END VIDEO CLIP) O`DONNELL: The Doctor Orlowski was then able to announce that the three shooting victims her team was treating are all going to recover including the police officer who was shot multiple times. Then 15 minutes later in that press conference, in a response to a question about the hospital`s experience treating gunshot victims, Dr. Orlowski said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ORLOWSKI: We see a lot of trauma and, you know, sometimes it`s just accidents that occur. And then you see what I call senseless trauma. And there is something evil in our society that we as Americans have to work to try to eradicate. I have to say I may see this every day. I may, you know, be the chief medical officer of a very large trauma center, but there is something wrong here when we have these multiple shootings, these multiple injuries, there is something wrong. And the only thing that I can say is we have to work together to get rid of it. I would like you to put my trauma center out of business. I really would. It`s a great city. It`s a great country and we have to work together to get rid of this because we just cannot have one, you know, more shooting with, you know, so many people killed. We have got figure this out. We have got to be able to help each other. It`s a challenge to all of us. Let`s get rid of this. This is not America. This is not Washington D.C. This is not good. (END VIDEO CLIP) O`DONNELL: Joining me now from MedStar Washington hospital, Dr. Janis Orlowski. Thank you very much, Dr. Orlowski, for staying up late on this very long day to join us now. Your know, your comment there towards the end of your press conference really captured the nation`s attention today beyond the very helpful information that you gave about your patients. It sounds like it is a truly wearisome duty that you have there, processing a of these gunshot victims not just today but Washington D.C. in and out of that hospital. ORLOWSKI: Well, I think it is. The recorder asked me a question. She said we know you to be a great trauma center. We know that you are taking care of victims, but is there something different about today? And I think that I spoke not only as a physician as the chief medical officer, but I spoke as a mother, as someone who is in this community and it is not only weary. I have to say that I worry about this. I worry about our community. Mass murders, people walking through schools, people walking through movie theaters, people walking through workplaces. Unfortunately it is common or more common than what it should be. And I think that I spoke from the heart when I said we have got to work together as a community to stop this. O`DONNELL: You are certainly in emergency medicine doing your end of this terrible task. But does it feel at the end of this task that society, that government that we are in fact not coming together as you said we must in order to minimize how much of this burden we are sending into our hospitals? ORLOWSKI: I think that there is much more that we can be doing and that we should be doing. We have multiple mass murders throughout the United States. We have individuals who some of them we know needed mental health care. A number of them could have been identified. I think that we just as you would see anyone who is bleeding on the street to call 911, I think we he to be able to identify and help those individuals who suffer other illnesses that make them act in this way. I believe that it`s not just rage. I believe that it`s not just anger. I believe that it is an illness. So, it`s an evilness to have someone raise arms against their fellow man. It`s wrong. We need to work to eradicate it. And whether it`s more support, more mental health, whether it is programs to help individuals, I spoke frankly when I said to the country and to the people who were listening we h",Rick Perry: Democrats living 'in a fantasy world' with climate change rhetoric,mixture,
3c15ac92,"November 11, 2020 Victims of Voter Fraud: Initial Announcement of Deceased Georgians Used to Vote in 2020 General Election The American people deserve a free, fair, and fully transparent election in which every legal ballot is counted and every illegal ballot is not counted. Having confidence in our elections means knowing that votes are legally cast and that voters themselves are legally eligible to cast a ballot. Americans cannot have confidence in election results unless elected officials, law enforcement authorities, and fair-minded journalists take the issue of voter fraud seriously and investigate potential instances thoroughly. The Trump campaign will continue to bring these allegations to light, and the media and election authorities should vigorously examine them. Here are several examples in Georgia that should be investigated: Voter records show someone used the identity of Mrs. Deborah Jean Christiansen of Roswell, Georgia to vote in the recent election, even though Mrs. Christiansen passed away in May 2019. Further, someone registered Christiansen to vote on October 5, the day of the deadline to register, more than a year after she passed away. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution ran an obituary announcing Christiansen’s death at the time of her passing. Someone used the identity of James Blalock of Covington, Georgia to cast a ballot in last week’s election, even though Blalock died in 2006. Blalock’s death notice ran in the Journal-Constitution shortly after he passed away that year. Linda Kesler of Nicholson, Georgia died in 2003, but someone cast a ballot under her identity in last week’s election. Nicholson’s death notice ran in the Journal-Constitution when she passed away. Edward Skwiot of Trenton, Georgia is shown as having cast a ballot last week, even though he died in 2015. The Chattanooga Times Free Press ran a death notice in April of that year. These victims of voter fraud deserve justice, and legal voters should be able to have confidence that their votes are not rendered meaningless due to illegally cast votes.",Victims of Voter Fraud: Initial Announcement of Deceased Georgians Used to Vote in 2020 General Election,mixture,

2e16ed0f,"By Tom Hughes Columnist Dave Lister recently suggested that one of our community's most important investment tools -- urban renewal -- was so outdated we should abandon it. Interestingly, he did so by linking it to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Ike was our president from 1953 until 1961. He understood the value of shared investments in important public structures and systems. Ike launched NASA to compete in the space race. The technological advances NASA created are the foundation of our ability to compete in today's technology-driven age. The private jobs created by our investments in NASA support middle-class families across our nation. Eisenhower also signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act, which literally paved the way for $25 billion of investment in 41,000 miles of interstate highways. Our highways support countless jobs and make it safer, faster and easier for all of us to travel. It's impossible to imagine how much poorer and less competitive we would be without our highways. Our nation's investments in roads, bridges, research and other public structures distinguish us from countries in the developing world. Similarly, investments in local communities throughout our own urban region help make the most of our cities, towns and neighborhoods and distinguish us from sprawling regions around the nation. In Portland, urban renewal-based investments in roads, parks, sidewalks and streetcars spurred $3 billion of investment in private projects that repaired dilapidated buildings and created new ones on vacant and underutilized land in the Pearl District. Today, the Pearl supports thousands of homes -- 20 percent affordable -- and many new middle-class jobs. And because people choose to live in the Pearl, we can protect the farms, forests and outdoor recreation opportunities we all enjoy, instead of sprawling like other communities. Public investments -- many funded by urban renewal -- also were essential to Intel's decision to locate in Hillsboro. Intel's facilities increased the community's tax base by $600 million. The company is a key reason our region is the second-fastest-growing exporter in the country. These examples of how our entire community benefits from strategic public investments that support and complement the private sector are no different from the benefits we all get from our highways and space program. And there are many more examples. At a time when federal and state money for the repair and replacement of aging pipes, sewers, potholed streets and schools is dwindling, it's more important than ever that we use every tool available -- including urban renewal -- to make the most of the public structures our parents and grandparents built to support our middle class. If we cast aside the important role of the public sector in creating great communities, it will cost us billions of dollars in lost jobs and productivity, and our children and grandchildren will be poorer as a result. We need more tools, not fewer, to ensure strategic public investments continue to pave the way to prosperity for everyone in our community.

8e967b1f,"Trump seeks to ban transgender people from serving in U.S. military 'in any capacity' Show Caption Hide Caption Trump says military will no longer accept transgender troops President Donald Trump said he will reverse former President Obama's policy that allowed transgender troops to serve openly in the military. USA TODAY WASHINGTON — President Trump said Wednesday that the U.S. military will not accept transgender troops into its ranks or allow them to serve in any capacity, reversing a policy that began under the Obama administration – and triggering intense criticism from lawmakers and civil libertarians. In a series of morning tweets, Trump said that, after consulting ""with my generals and military experts,"" the U.S. government ""will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military."" The U.S. military, he said, ""must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail."" Trump's decision was made Tuesday, and he informed Defense Secretary Jim Mattis later in the day, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters Wednesday. The policy allowing transgender troops to serve was ""expensive and disruptive"" and affected military readiness, she said. Democrats disagreed. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, called Trump's announcement ""an unwarranted and disgraceful attack on men and women who have been bravely serving their country."" Related: It’s unclear how Trump's tweets will affect the estimated 6,000 transgender troops who are already in the military. Under the policy announced in July 2016, those troops were allowed to serve openly. Prior to that, the military discharged them for medical reasons. It's also uncertain whether a series of tweets constitute a presidential directive, and whether Trump must sign documents to make the new policy effective. After the tweets, the Pentagon issued a statement saying only that it would work with the White House ""to address the new guidance"" provided by the president. Brad Carson, the former chief of Pentagon personnel issues and an architect of the policy, said Trump's sudden announcement appeared to catch the Pentagon ""flat-footed,"" and he predicted the renewed ban will be challenged in court. ""This will be devastating to those service members, but it will also hurt national security, as we have transgender people in many mission-critical occupations,"" Carson told USA TODAY. Joshua Block, a lead attorney on the issue with the ACLU, said the group most certainly will mount a legal challenge. But he noted that Pentagon regulations allowing transgender troops to serve openly remain in effect. ""Even the president can't eliminate regulations by tweet,"" Block said. Senate Dems hit health vote, transgender ban Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut expressed criticism of Republicans who were still trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Others railed against President Donald Trump's move to ban transgender people from the military. (July 26) AP The method of Trump's notice by Twitter also drew ire. Noting that Trump's statements are unclear, and that the Pentagon is already complying with parts of the Obama transgender policy, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said the sudden news ""is yet another example of why major policy announcements should not be made via Twitter."" McCain, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, also noted that many transgender troops are serving honorably and that anybody who meets medical and readiness standards should be allowed in the military. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, issued a brief, pointed statement criticizing Trump's announcement, saying discrimination in any form is wrong and that he needs clarity from the military about what the tweeted policy means. ""Transgender people are people, and deserve the best we can do for them,"" Hatch said. Meanwhile, former Obama administration officials, prominent Democrats and civil rights advocates condemned Trump's announcement. Ashton Carter, who instituted the policy that would allow transgender troops to serve as President Obama's defense secretary, said the only thing that matters in choosing service members is that they are qualified. ""There are already transgender individuals who are serving capably and honorably,"" Carter said. ""This action would also send the wrong signal to a younger generation thinking about military service."" Former Vice President Joe Biden tweeted that ""every patriotic American who is qualified to serve in our military should be able to serve. Full stop."" In a tweet of her own, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told Trump that ""this fight is not over,"" and ""hatred will never defeat #pride."" The advocacy organization GLAAD called it ""another example of the Trump administration attempting to make LGBTQ people invisible."" And some Democrats used the opportunity to slam Trump's own lack of military service. In its statement, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee called the president a ""draft dodger."" Some Republicans also criticized the policy reversal. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., tweeted that ""no American, no matter their sexual orientation or gender identity, should be prohibited from honor + privilege of serving our nation #LGBT."" Many Republicans, including Vice President Mike Pence, had criticized the transgender policy, and applauded Trump's move. Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., said on Twitter that she was pleased to see that Trump ""shares my readiness and cost concerns,"" and ""will be changing this costly and damaging policy."" The issue, she said, comes down to military readiness. She sponsored an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that was narrowly defeated on July 13 that would have prohibited funding medical treatment for transgender troops. However, the Pentagon commissioned a report last year by the non-partisan RAND Corp. on transgender troops that found medical treatment would cost no more than $8 million per year and have a negligible impact on the military’s readiness to fight. Under Trump and Mattis, the Pentagon delayed implementation of a key portion of the Obama administration's plan: requiring the services to begin accepting and recruiting new officers and enlisted troops. The Army, Air Force and Marine Corps requested more time to implement the policy, saying they needed time to study the effects of accepting transgender troops. The Army has compulsory sensitivity training for soldiers and civilian employees. Some members of Congress have also tried to limit spending on transgender troops in this year’s legislation authorizing military spending. What does it mean to identify as LGBT? Here is a guide to understanding LGBT terms. Sara Snyder, USA TODAY On Tuesday, in a statement to USA TODAY, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen urged the acceptance of transgender troops by the military, saying that previous policies that prevented gay and lesbian troops from serving damaged the military. During his six months in office, Trump has reversed a number of Obama policies, from environmental regulations to U.S. membership in the Paris climate change agreement. The transgender announcement is the latest example, and it's a decision that is likely to have political implications. Trump sought the support of LGBT voters during last year's election against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. In tweet sent in June of 2016, he told the LGBT community that ""I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs."" Yet social conservatives applauded the decision. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, said that, ""as our nation faces serious national security threats, our troops shouldn’t be forced to endure hours of transgender ‘sensitivity’ classes and politically-correct distractions like this one."" Republican consultant Liz Mair, a Trump critic, said the decision could help him politically with socially conservative voters. ""Even though this decision is totally cynical and was not made properly and is dubious on its merits, Trump could look semi-reasonable, given the response and existing perceptions."" With Trump struggling in public opinion polls, Mair said the decision ""won't improve his approval rating but might actually help stop some bleeding.""

c83e9ca4,"FORMER President Olusegun Obasanjo, on Saturday, declared that in Nigeria today, over 14 million children that should be in school were not in school, and thereby deprived of education. Obasanjo made this known in Lagos at the virtual 2020 Fellowship Graduation Ceremony of the second cohort of “Teach for Nigeria Fellows”. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that “Teach For Nigeria”, an NGO, graduated 161 fellows who have impacted approximately 9,660 students in 80 schools across Lagos, Ogun, and the Kaduna States. NAN reports that “Teach For Nigeria” focuses on developing a movement of leaders across Nigeria who are committed to putting an end to educational inequity. Obasanjo said: “They are deprived of opportunities that will allow them to develop their abilities and become useful to themselves and their communities. “It is evident that at this point, to transform our education system in a sustainable way, Nigerian youths must take up leadership positions.” According to him, our youths must champion different innovative solutions at every level of the society and across different sectors. “It is inspiring to see the work that ‘Teach For Nigeria’ is doing to equip promising future leaders with the skills and experience to drive the change that we need,” the former president said. He added that the leaders had dedicated their time, energy and resources to inspire love for learning, improved educational outcomes, and enhanced life opportunities for children in the classrooms. “As a result of your commitment, your pupils have succeeded at various academic and non-academic competitions. “I recently learnt about pupils of ‘Teach For Nigeria Fellows’ who came second in the National Lafarge Competition and other scholarship opportunities. “They also initiated actions by working with stakeholders such as parents, community members, heads of schools and other teachers,” Obasanjo said. He, however, advised the fellows to continue to leverage their acquired skills and experiences to advocate for educational excellence in the country. The former president urged them to be ambassadors for change, driving the movement for freedom and justice in Nigeria. “I strongly advise that you remain resilient in your fight for educational equity, not relenting on the strides of deploying solutions to tackle the myriads of problems confronting our education system. “Please do not let anybody tell you that you are leaders of tomorrow, you are leaders today,” Obasanjo said. Also, Folawe Omikunle, the Chief Executive Officer, Teach For Nigeria, said that graduating fellows had spent the past two years improving the academic outcomes of their pupils. Omikunle said that they ignited the love for learning in these pupils, instilling self-belief, successfully galvanizing parental and community support to aid pupils learning process. “The graduating 161 fellows are joining our maiden set of 44 Alumni members, thereby bringing the number of our Alumni network to 205 members. “Teach For Nigeria is a lifelong commitment in the fight against educational inequity. “We are positive that our Alumni will continue to work toward ensuring that one day we have a Nigeria where every child can attain an excellent education,” she said.

,"The deputy secretary at the US Treasury has said that the only way to end the plague of empty shelves and high prices around the country is for every person in the world to be vaccinated.  In an interview to ABC on Thursday, Wally Adeyemo, the Biden administration’s second-highest official in the Treasury Department, has commented on the ongoing shortages of consumer goods that have led many to mock the president as ‘Empty Shelves Joe’.  Despite viral photos depicting thousands of cargo ships lined up at the Port of Los Angeles ready to unload their goods, Adeyemo claimed that the supply chain issues plaguing so many US retailers are an international issue and will only let up when a sufficient percentage of the country has been vaccinated.  Also on rt.com #EmptyShelvesJoe trend dominates Twitter as ships back up at ports and Biden administration blames… Trump?  Describing the disastrous economic conditions as “an economy that’s in transition,” Adeyemo acknowledged that “we are seeing high prices for some of the things that people have to buy.” While he praised the administration’s stimulus payments, he also argued that people all over the world should get jabbed in order for the economy to get back on track.  The reality is that the only way we’re going to get to a place where we work through this transition is if everyone in America and everyone around the world gets vaccinated.  While the ABC reporter repeatedly suggested that the country’s shortages of toilet paper and other panic-buy items could be traced to international supply chain disruptions, a growing number of Americans are demanding answers regarding the weirdly specific nature of certain products missing from store shelves. Some have even voiced doubt concerning whether the shortages are being introduced deliberately, either to gin up hatred against the unvaccinated or keep Americans economically off-balance as they grow accustomed to the wild disruptions of the pandemic.  Adeyemo did the Biden cabinet no favors by adding fuel to the conspiratorial fire, explaining the primary reason Biden continued to push for everyone to be vaccinated was that only then could the White House “provide the resources the American people need to make it to the other side” of the supply chain problem.  Despite blaming the international shipping industry for empty shelves in the US, the media establishment has acknowledged that the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach - which together process 40% of the nation’s imports - had their busiest years on record last year, giving the lie to the notion that the products missing from American shelves simply don’t exist. However, many truckers working for shipping companies have balked at the idea of mandatory vaccination, leaving their firms’ fleets woefully understaffed, and others have gone on strike to demand better working conditions.  Also on rt.com How Covid catastrophizing & a colossal crimewave are causing America’s second Great Retail Panic  The Biden administration has attempted to address the supply chain problem by calling for the Port of Los Angeles to run 24 hours, but while he praised his own promised move as a “game changer,” the executive director of the port has made it clear that there is no timetable in place for the promised schedule shift. Meanwhile, Biden’s cabinet has come across as woefully out of touch - White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain, for example, pooh-poohed the issue of empty shelves as a “high class” problem earlier this week, eliciting criticism from both Left and Right. And Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has been quietly vacationing on paternity leave since mid-August, leaving the country without even a semblance of logistical oversight as the cargo clog shows no signs of dissipating.  Labor shortages are being felt far beyond the US, though often for similar reasons. In Italy, thousands of protesters turned out to block cargo ships from unloading their bounty earlier this week. The demonstrators were outraged over the country’s adoption of a mandatory vax-to-work policy similar to that threatened by the Biden administration. And the UK government has begged lorry drivers to return to work, even luring foreign drivers in with temporary visas as the country frets over its own empty shelves issues.  Australian ‘truckies’ have united with other unions to exert pressure on the government, which has kept cities like Melbourne under lockdown for months despite vanishingly few reported cases of Covid-19.

80c02218,"Sajid Javid pictured was last night facing an all-out revolt over business rates  Theresa May retains 'full confidence' in Communities Secretary Sajid Javid despite him facing an all out revolt over business rates.  The embattled Cabinet minister has insisted critics of the business rate revaluation have been misled by a 'relentless campaign of distortions and half-truths'.  But Mr Javid is facing claims from Tory colleagues that he is 'spinning the numbers' and a letter sent to calm down the row played down the rises.  As the row threatened to boil over, Mrs May's official spokesman was asked if the PM continued to have full confidence in Mr Javid.  He replied: 'Yes.'  The Government insists 73 per cent of firms will have the same rates or lower bills - but this leave 510,000 companies facing higher charges.  In a letter, Mr Javid begged MPs to reassure their constituents about the changes, arguing that three quarters of businesses will see their rates frozen or cut.  But last night Mr Javid was accused of peddling misinformation of his own as a new analysis suggested the Government's figures were inaccurate. The study said the bills that firms will actually receive over the next few weeks will be 7 percentage points higher on average than ministers say.  This is because 2 per cent inflation has not been factored in and the Government has assumed that its appeals system will give 5 per cent rebates to all firms – despite challenges being harder and more costly to mount.  Ex minister Grant Shapps today accused Mr Javid of 'spinning the numbers'.  He told Sky News: 'It has been suggested by Government this is fiscally neutral but it raises £1bn.  'Better just to say that, rather than spin it out as something which actually saves businesses money when it doesn't.'  Ex-minister Grant Shapps today accused Mr Javid of 'spinning the numbers' in the row over a revaluation of business rates  Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said he challenged Chancellor Philip Hammond about the disputed figures at a meeting of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee yesterday.  'I'm disappointed that it would appear that the figures we were given did not set out the actual position,' he said. 'The list sets out a best case scenario. I challenged the Chancellor on it but I received no answer.'  Mr Javid's letter – also signed by Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke – said rates would fall in 250 of the 329 local billing authority areas in England – and detailed these in a list accompanying the letter.  According to an analysis by ratings specialist Gerald Eve, rates will fall in only 135 councils – and increase in 191.  Basildon, Harrogate, Canterbury and Stafford are among 124 local authorities in line for an overall hike in business rates, as opposed to the cut promised by the Government. Basildon will see business rates rise by 0.15 per cent, instead of fall by 6.3 per cent. Harrogate will see a 2.27 per cent jump, as opposed to a 4.3 per cent cut, and Canterbury will see a 0.92 per cent hike, rather than a 4.3 per cent fall.  The Communities Secretary claims small firms have been misled by a 'relentless campaign of distortions and half-truths'  The analysis says Theresa May's Maidenhead constituency will see a 15.75 per cent increase in business rates – rather than a 8.3 per cent rise claimed in the list accompanying Mr Javid's letter.  At the same time, the fall in rates in Mr Javid's Bromsgrove constituency will only be 9.29 per cent – as opposed to the Government's figure of 15.2 per cent  Jerry Schurder, head of business rates at Gerald Eve, said last night: 'The figures provided to Tory MPs show that the Department for Communities is living in a parallel universe, one where there is no inflation and an automated appeals system that gives 5 per cent rates rebates across the board.  Theresa May, pictured yesterday on the campaign trail in the Stoke by-election, retains confidence in Sajid Javid despite the furore over business rates  'But back in the real world, the bills that will land on doormats in the next few weeks will be around 7 per cent higher than these figures suggest, while appeals will be become both more expensive and less likely to succeed as the Government seeks to disincentivise businesses from challenging their bills.'  The Department for Communities and Local Government last night rejected claims that the figures were misleading. It referred the Mail to the small print which states: 'The average change in bills is before any inflation or appeals adjustments have been made.'  Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: 'Sajid Javid complained about half truths and then he puts out this guff. These figures are pure misinformation and half truths.The Government should be ashamed of themselves. They are spinning so much on this issue they are making everyone dizzy.  'While they put our data strewn with errors, small businesses are panicking about the impact of these massive rate hikes. It is time for a U-turn. The Government need to make it soon.'  Mr Javid was also under fire from business groups, MPs and small firms, which claimed he had also omitted key information from his letter about the devastating impact rate rises will have.  The Institute of Directors described Mr Javid's failure to mention the half a million firms that will see their rates go up as 'disingenuous' and warned that 'tens of thousands' could go bust.  Stephen Herring, the IoD's head of taxation, said: 'The Government is right that many businesses will see their rate bills go down, but the issue is the sudden and dramatic increases that many high street shops and pubs are having to deal with. It is disingenuous to focus on average rate reductions and ignore the fact that many small firms are facing huge rate hikes. We could see tens of thousands of firms go bust.'  The British Retail Consortium said in a statement: 'No one is a winner from this revaluation. Business rates have increased from a third of rental value in 1990 to half today.  Amanda Wrigley and her mother Shirley outside their shop Hirst Antiques, in Notting Hill, which is facing a big hike in business rates  'This is the highest commercial property tax in the developed world.The current system is not fit for purpose in the 21st century and needs fundamental reform.'  One antiques dealer said the rates hike could be the 'final nail in the coffin' for many struggling high street retailers.  Amanda Wrigley runs Hirst Antiques in Notting Hill, London, with her mother Shirley Hirst, who founded the business 53 years ago. Miss Wrigley, 36, said her rates would double while chains faced much smaller increases.  She told the Mail: 'This is not a myth. We're not making this up. This is going to affect business across the country. A lot of us are feeling the pinch already – but this could be the final nail in the coffin.  'My mum is still working at the age of 80 and enjoys what she does. But it's a lot less fun when first our rent and then out rates go up. It makes us wonder how we're going to make it work.'  Yesterday another ratings specialist said Mr Javid had also failed to mention that thousands of firms in line for the biggest cuts to business rates will not benefit for the full reduction for years because of transitional arrangements.  Analysis from ratings specialist Daniel Watney found half of firms set for the biggest rate cuts will not receive the full reduction for three years – and one in five will not see the full benefit at all before rates are revalued again in five years.  A Government spokesman said: 'These are completely spurious claims by ratings agents with more interest in their own profits than a fair deal for businesses.  'We have been clear how our figures are calculated and what they include. In fact the revaluation of business rates means three quarters of businesses will see a fall, or no change, in their bills – 600,000 small businesses will pay no rates at all.  'Far from stopping anyone appealing their bills, or setting a margin of error, our reforms will mean businesses will no longer need to go through these scaremongering ratings agencies but instead can check, challenge and appeal their bills quickly and easily.'  Debunked: Minister's claim hikes are a myth  Analysis by Business Correspondent James Salmon  Sajid Javid has written directly to MPs to try to quell the rebellion against his business rates reforms. The Communities Secretary insisted the row was based on 'myths'. But business groups last night accused him of peddling half-truths of his own.  JAVID'S CLAIM  He says the first 'myth' about revaluation is that there will be 'across the board rate rises'.  REALITY  Nobody has been claiming that most businesses will see their business rates rise. Mr Javid points out that the revaluation will lift around 600,000 smaller firms out of paying business rates, while around 740,000 will see their rates frozen. But there is no mention of government figures showing around half a million business will see an increase in their rates of up to 300 per cent.  The minister also hails the 'unprecedented £6.7billion package of rate relief' to ensure that those facing the biggest rate hikes see them phased in gradually. But what Mr Javid omits to say is that those firms that have been lined up for cuts will not enjoy the full benefits for years. A 'downwards cap' on rate reductions means small firms can see their rates trimmed by a maximum of 20 per cent in 2017/18.  These caps are even stricter for medium and larger firms – which will receive a maximum discount of 4.1 per cent in the first year of the new regime. The reliefs are likely to come too late for the thousands of businesses already paying over the odds because the last revaluation was carried out at the height of the pre-credit crisis property boom in 2008.  According to business rates expert Daniel Watney, half of properties seeing the biggest falls in rates will not benefit from their full rates cut for three years, while one in five will not see their full rates cut before the next revaluation in five years.  CLAIM  Revaluation is 'emphatically not being used to hide a stealth rise in taxes'.  REALITY  Government figures suggest the revaluation will raise an additional £1billion in the first year alone. Business rates will raise £25.5billion in 2017-18, after the changes are introduced on April 1, up from £24.5billion this year.  Mr Javid has insisted this is simply because the number of businesses is expected to grow, with some expanding or renovating premises. This means more, and bigger businesses, will be paying into the pot.  But the British Retail Consortium and Institute of Directors both fear the reforms will drive many traders to the wall, meaning any increase in revenues to the Exchequer will have to come from firms paying more.  claim Suggestions that the rates review will devastate high streets are 'simply not true'.  Reality Again, Mr Javid appears to have deliberately misinterpreted or ignored warnings from business leaders. Lobby groups – including the Institute of Directors and the British Retail Consortium – have never suggested that hundreds of thousands of firms will go bust.  However, given that more than half a million enterprises will see their rates shoot up by up 300 per cent, the IoD believes that tens of thousands of pubs and restaurants which are already struggling, will be tipped over the edge. Retail expert Mary Portas has warned that the revaluation will 'cripple' high street shops in areas where house prices have increased.  'The tax bill which will hit retailers from April will be the single biggest blow to independent shops since the financial crisis,' she said. 'I would estimate that at least a third of them will die.'  CLAIM  The Government is 'reforming the appeals process to make it easier for business to check, challenge and appeal their bills'.  REALITY  It will become tougher and more expensive for firms to appeal, once a complaint has been rejected by the Government's Valuation Tribunal. What Mr Javid fails to mention in his letter is that the Government is introducing new charges of £150 for small firms just to appeal their rate to a tribunal. Larger companies will have to pay £300.  The Government also plans to fine businesses up to £500 if they make a 'careless' or deliberate mistake while filling out their forms. Officials claim it will deter businesses from lodging speculative appeals backed with little or no evidence. This should help to clear a backlog of 280,000 appeal cases that stretch back to 2010.  But several other changes have also been made to the appeals process that will make it harder for businesses to complain.  Previously, it was a two-stage process involving a simple form and no fees were charged. Now, it is expected to become a three-stage process, including an initial 'checking' stage where firms must confirm that every part of their property which the valuation is based on is accurate.  Experts say that businesses will also be required to submit more formal evidence than before. If the appeal has still not been resolved, the final stage is a tribunal, when a fee is charged.",PM May stands by Sajd Javid after business rates dossier,mixture,
3dcc5d7d,"Today, Congressman Mike Rogers introduced HR 1813, the Border Wall Funding Act of 2017. This bill, which is supported and endorsed by FAIR, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, would impose a 2% fee on all remittances headed south of the US border. Remittances, or wire transfers, are commonly used by illegal immigrants to move money from the US to their home countries. In 2014, Mexico alone received over $24 billion in remittances sent from the US, while other South and Central American countries received over 15% of their GDPs in the form of remittances. “President Trump has made it very clear that he intends to complete a wall along our Southern border. As a senior member of the Homeland Security committee, I have long supported the border wall, which will protect Americans.” Rogers said. “In order to jumpstart the funding of the wall, I have introduced a bill to impose a 2% fee on remittances sent south of the border. This bill is simple – anyone who sends their money to countries that benefit from our porous borders and illegal immigration should be responsible for providing some of the funds needed to complete the wall. This bill keeps money in the American economy, and most importantly, it creates a funding stream to build the wall,” Rogers said. - ### -",Noa Pothoven: 'no question of euthanasia' says health minister after teen dies at home CORRECTED,mixture,
286dcb31,"The money that lawyers make has shot up by nearly a quarter in just five years, it was revealed yesterday. Despite strikes by barristers over their pay levels and protests from senior lawyers who demand greater taxpayer subsidies, the legal profession has been booming, according to official figures. They show that last year lawyers across Britain achieved a turnover of £32.2 billion – almost 24 per cent more than the £26.0 billion they earned in 2011. Last year lawyers across Britain achieved a turnover of £32.2 billion – a huge rise in five years The disclosure of the scale and speed at which lawyers have been increasing income drew scathing criticism from some critics of the exploitation of ‘no win no fee’ deals and other new means by which lawyers earn their fees. One said the legal profession has ‘lost its way morally.’ But bodies representing solicitors and barristers said their earnings were vital to the UK economy. The cash rolling in to law firms and chambers means that the earnings of the legal profession are now higher than last year’s £27 billion Ministry of Defence budget for running the army, navy and air force. At the same time numbers of lawyers working in England and Wales have been rising fast. Figures provided by a legal watchdog say that in April 2015 there were 142,109 solicitors and 15,237 barristers. Together with paralegals and auxiliaries, the count shows there were 171,198 people working in the legal profession. They far outnumber regular police officers – 126,818 last spring – or regular service personnel, 153,720 in April last year. Just a decade ago, in 2004, there were 96,757 solicitors and 11,564 barristers, according to Whitehall figures. This means that over the 10-year period – during which legal chiefs regularly complained about the financial pressures on their profession and the difficulties for young people in making careers in the law – the number of solicitors rose by 47 per cent, and the number of barristers by 32 per cent. The figures on legal turnover and numbers were released by the Legal Services Board, which oversees legal regulation in England and Wales. Its turnover numbers were taken from figures gathered by the Office for National Statistics. They were made public following years of protest from leaders of the legal profession over cuts to the taxpayer-funded legal aid budget, which were accused of impoverishing criminal lawyers and preventing the public from getting ‘access to justice’. Former Justice Secretary Michael Gove abandoned the attempt to save £100 million from the £1.6 billion legal aid total at the beginning of this year. The plans would have meant reducing fees for lawyers representing suspects in police stations and slashing numbers of contracts for duty solicitors. Lawyers’ campaigning against legal aid cuts included a series of strikes by barristers who protested that some of their number earned as little as £13,000 a year – although one picket line protest outside the Old Bailey was marred when one barrister joined in carrying a £1,100 Mulberry handbag. Dr David Green, director of the Civitas think tank and author of a recent book on the direction of the legal profession, said that the spread of no win no fee deals and, more recently, ‘damages-based agreements’, had undermined the ethos of the legal profession. The figures on legal turnover and numbers were released by the Legal Services Board ‘It was never the case in the past that lawyers could do what they do now, take a percentage of the damages,’ Dr Green said. ‘It used to be considered wrong and barristers used to fight against the idea that they would be paid a share of the spoils rather than a straightforward fee. ‘The law has become a massive gravy train, and disputes are now regarded by lawyers not as an occasion for the application of justice but as an opportunity to make money. The legal profession has lost its way morally.’ However the Law Society, the professional body for solicitors, said: ‘The legal profession makes a vital contribution to UK PLC – the legal sector grew at 3.3 per cent every year for the last decade compared with 1.2 per cent in the wider economy. ‘An estimated 370,000 people are employed in legal services in the UK. Every 100 extra jobs in legal services supports a further 67 jobs to the wider economy.’ A spokesman added: ‘This healthy growth was influenced by a number of factors between 2012 and 2015. The main drivers include the increase in business transactions which often require expert legal advice. There has also been a significant hike in house sales which has boosted the amount of conveyancing work undertaken by law firms in a highly competitive market.’ Chantal-Aimée Doerries, chairman of the Bar Council which represents barristers, said: ‘It is important to recognise that whereas the overall income of the legal profession has risen, largely due to increasing demand for international legal services, there are sectors of the profession that are suffering, notably those that are committed to providing services to the economically weakest in our society. ‘As a result of successive governments making substantial cuts to legal aid for criminal cases, and the complete removal of legal aid in many social welfare and family areas, many citizens have been deprived of legal representation, and of meaningful access to justice. A further impact of the radical cuts to legal aid is that the professions are doing more than ever pro bono.",Casey Anthony Pregnant With Twins,mixture,

But analysis of Internet searches made in the small hours revealed many people may not have known exactly what they were voting for in the EU referendum.

Google Trends recorded a huge spike in the number of people asking ‘What happens if we leave the EU?’, after the polls had closed (pictured) UNCERTAIN BRITS TAKE TO GOOGLE The analytics arm of Californian search giant Google recorded a huge spike in the numbers of Brits querying the fallout of yesterday's EU referendum vote. Google Trends recorded a spike in the number of people asking ‘What happens if we leave the EU?’, after the polls had closed. However, the search term was relatively flat in the week running up to the vote. Advertisement Early this morning, the analytics arm of the search giant said it had seen a huge jump in the search term. However, analysis shows the question only started to rise as the polls were closing and had been relatively flat in the week running up to the vote. On Twitter, Google Trends wrote: ‘+250 per cent spike in ‘what happens if we leave the EU’ in the past hour’. The search result is expected given the complex arrangement of the EU, with many keen to know how agreements affecting trade and the UK's commitments as a member state will be unpicked as the UK leaves. In the weeks and months running up to the vote, many criticised the deluge of information coming from the opposing camps, as well as industry leaders, economists, scientists and celebrities all voicing their support. At the start of the month, Conservative MP and 'vote leave' advocate Michael Gove said: 'I think people in this country have had enough of experts,' speaking in response to the claims of a expert consensus cited by the 'remain' campaign. The results of the referendum showed 51.9% of UK voters opted to leave the EU. But analysis of search trends in the run up to the vote provide an insight into widepsread confusion among voters Earlier this month, Google released data showing the terms Brits were searching for in the run up to the referendum, revealing ‘immigration’ and ‘NHS’ topping the list. The data, which covered searches over a seven day period from 31st May to 7th June, provided a glimpse into what concerned people across the UK most, but belied a sense of general confusion. +250% spike in ""what happens if we leave the EU"" in the past hourhttps://t.co/9b1d6Bsx6D — GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) June 24, 2016 With so many conflicting points on such a complex issue, the data show many Brits are simply seeking a straight answer, searching for ‘Why should we leave/stay in the EU?’, followed closely by ‘What will happen if…?’. Google Trends recorded a spike in activity in people searching for 'What happens if we leave the EU?' after the polls had closed But in the week leading up to the vote this activity was largely flat But the top question across the UK concerning the EU referendum is ‘What is ‘Brexit’?’ referring to the term coined for Britain's exit from the EU. The initial fallout from the referendum has shown a drop in the value of Sterling, with more than £100 billion wiped from the FTSE 100 this morning as stock markets reacted to the result. Prime Minister David Cameron has also announced he will be stepping down following the defeat of the remain campaign. But beyond these initial events, it could take a while for the full scale of the UK's decision to become apparent. Earlier in the month, the top search terms were immigration, NHS, economy, sovereignty and national security. But the question most people across the UK were asking was ‘What is ‘Brexit’?’, referring to the term coined for Britain's exit from the EU (pictured) An interactive heat map of search terms in the run up to the referendum showed more people were searching for ‘leave’ in built up metropolitan areas (pictured) Search analysis in the run up to the vote revealed that more people were searching for 'leave' in metropolitan areas, but rather than an indication of voter preference, it could have been explained by people searching for the more information into the potential impact of a British exit from the EU. The final count of the UK vote showed 72.2 per cent of the population cast their vote, with 51.9 per cent voting to leave the EU. A total of 48.1 per cent of voters opted to remain in the EU, with the greatest proportion in London, Scotland and Northern Ireland.","Re: Trans-Pecos Pipeline, LLC Presidio Crossing Pmject FERC Docket No. CP15- -000",mixture,
a99a84ae,"Scott Walker celebrates with supporters. (Darren Hauck/Getty) Why it was the most important GOP victory in the country The most important election in the country yesterday was the gubernatorial race in Wisconsin. In its historic implications, Scott Walker’s victory was on a par with the GOP’s winning control of the Senate, arguably as important as all the other gubernatorial and congressional elections put together. And the reasons have nothing to do with his presidential prospects. Walker has now proven that his reforms in Wisconsin are both a model for conservative reform and a winning electoral strategy. But those reforms still have a long way to go. The crucial question was whether Wisconsin’s voters were going to give him the chance to keep pushing. Advertisement Walker came to office inspired by the advice of Governor Mitch Daniels of Indiana, who told him to think bold and strike fast. The spearhead of Walker’s reform agenda was Act 10, which broke the stranglehold of public-sector unions on Wisconsin’s deplorable finances. Act 10 essentially turned Wisconsin, one of the leading lights of the labor-union movement, into a right-to-work state. (Wisconsin is still technically a union state with respect to the National Labor Relations Act, but private-sector unions in Wisconsin have waned to the point of irrelevance, so the major union presence was in the public sector.) The challenge Walker faced was that reforms take time to work, and – initially, at least — generate much more opposition than support. His approval ratings in Wisconsin plunged to 37 percent as the venomous reaction of entrenched special interests (in this case, public-sector unions) took its toll. Those special interests enjoyed enormous political support both in Wisconsin and across the country, and Walker had only four years to demonstrate that the benefits of conservative reform could outweigh that support among moderates and independents. Advertisement Progressives correctly identified the threat that Walker represents to them nationally. If the most sacred privileges of their special interests could be undone in the birthplace of progressivism, those perks wouldn’t be safe anywhere in the country. But if Walker had lost, it would have meant that sweeping conservative reforms of government would face uncertain prospects in virtually every state and at the national level. Governor Mitch Daniels succeeded in reforming Indiana, but he was in many ways sui generis. Now, however, what Daniels did in Indiana has been replicated in Wisconsin. The birthplace of progressivism, the Midwestern heartland, is becoming the birthplace of a new conservatism — a conservatism not just of limited government but of good government; not just pro-business but pro-competition, a conservatism bent on defending the common man from the rapacious rule of special interests. It’s a conservatism that can be true to its principles and still appeal to moderates, independents, and even Democrats. Indeed, a large number of Wisconsin voters have voted twice for Obama and twice for Walker. Walker was undoubtedly helped in this race by the neighboring example of Illinois, where Governor Pat Quinn has been busy demonstrating in Technicolor the flaws of progressive government. The Left explains Walker’s victory in terms of outside forces (read: Koch brothers) who influenced the election with their money. But no combination of cabals and conspiracies and evil corporations could have come close to helping Walker as much as the Democratic government of Illinois. There’s an even more important reason that Walker’s victory matters. A century of progressivism has left Wisconsin in a very deep hole. When Walker got to office, Wisconsin was one of the worst states in the country in which to do business, with one of the highest regulatory and tax burdens. Some estimates now rate it as No. 14 for doing business, but don’t be deceived. Wisconsin’s state budget is almost twice as large per person as the state budget of Texas, and even after billions in tax cuts, Wisconsin’s working families and businesses remain subject to a heavy tax burden. Freed from the shackles of heavy government, Wisconsin’s superbly productive labor force could transform it into one of the country’s leading economies — a “Texas model” for purple states. Advertisement Walker has a long way to go in proving that conservative reforms can work in the long term. For the moment, Wisconsin’s conservatives, moderates, and independents have decided to give him another term. Here’s hoping he doesn’t rest on his laurels, and instead once again thinks bold and strikes fast, as he did four years ago. — Mario Loyola, a contributing editor at National Review, is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin in Madison.",National Review,mixture,
72eb0d0c,"In response to Gen David Petraeus' denunciation of Florida pastor Terry Jones' right to engage in a symbolic protest of the 9/11 attacks by burning copies of the Quran this Sept. 11, President Obama said: ""Let me be clear: As a citizen, and as president, I believe that members of the Dove World Outreach Center have the same right to freedom of speech and religion as anyone else in this country."" Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida lauded Obama's remarks, saying America is ""a place where you're supposed to be able to practice your religion without the government telling you you can't."" New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg called Obama's words a ""clarion defense of the freedom of religion"" -- and also claimed that he had recently run into a filthy jihadist who actually supported the Quran-burning! Keith Olbermann read the poem ""First they came ..."" on air in defense of the Quran-burners, nearly bringing himself to tears at his own profundity. No wait, my mistake. This is what liberals said about the ground zero mosque only five minutes ago when they were posing as First Amendment absolutists. Suddenly, they've developed amnesia when it comes to the free-speech right to burn a Quran. Weirdly, conservatives who opposed building the mosque at ground zero are also against the Quran burning. (Except in my case. It turns out I'm for it, but mostly because burning Qurans will contribute to global warming.) Liberals couldn't care less about the First Amendment. To the contrary, censoring speech and religion is the left's specialty! (Any religion other than Islam.) They promote speech codes, hate crimes, free speech zones (known as ""America"" off college campuses), and go around the country yanking every reference to God from the public square via endless lawsuits by the ACLU. Whenever you see a liberal choking up over our precious constitutional rights, you can be sure we're talking about the rights of Muslims at ground zero, ""God Hates Fags"" funeral protesters, strippers, The New York Times publishing classified documents, pornographers, child molesters, murderers, traitors, saboteurs, terrorists, flag-burners (but not Quran-burners!) or women living on National Endowment of the Arts grants by stuffing yams into their orifices on stage. Speaking of lying dwarfs, last week on ""The Daily Show"" Bloomberg claimed he was having a hamburger with his ""girlfriend"" when a man came up to him and said of the ground zero mosque: ""I just got back from two tours fighting overseas for America. This is what we were all fighting for. You go and keep at it."" We're fighting for the right of Muslims to build mosques at ground zero? I thought we were trying to keep Muslims AWAY from our skyscrapers. (What an embarrassing misunderstanding.) PLEASE PULL THE TROOPS OUT IMMEDIATELY. But back to the main issue: Was Bloomberg having a $150 Burger Double Truffle at DB Bistro Moderne or a more sensible $30 burger at the 21 Club when he bumped into his imaginary veteran? With the pint-sized mayor shrieking at the sight of a saltshaker, I assume he wasn't having a Hardee's No. 4 Combo Meal. Adding an element of realism to his little vignette, Bloomberg said: ""I got a hamburger and a pickle and a potato chip or something."" A potato chip? Translation: ""I don't know what I was eating, because I'm making this whole story up -- I wouldn't be caught dead eating 'a potato chip' or any other picaresque garnish favored by the peasants."" At least Bloomberg didn't claim the man who walked up to him took credit for setting the Times Square bomb because he was a tea partier upset about ObamaCare -- as Sherlock Bloomberg had so presciently speculated at the time. Gen. Petraeus objected to the Quran-burning protest on the grounds that it could be used by radical jihadists to recruit Muslims to attack Americans. This is what liberals say whenever we do anything displeasing to the enemy -- invade Iraq, hold captured terrorists in Guantanamo, interrogate captured jihadists or publish Muhammad cartoons. Is there a website somewhere listing everything that encourages terrorist recruiting? If the general's main objective is to hamper jihadist recruiting, may I respectfully suggest unconditional surrender? Because on his theory, you know what would really kill the terrorists' recruiting ability? If we adopted Sharia law! But wait -- weren't we assured by Fire Island's head of national security, Andrew Sullivan, that if America elected a ""brown-skinned man whose father was an African, who grew up in Indonesia and Hawaii, who attended a majority-Muslim school as a boy,"" the terrorists would look like a bunch of lunkheads and be unable to recruit? It didn't work out that way. There have been more terrorist attacks on U.S. soil by these allegedly calmed Muslims in Obama's first 18 months in office than in the six years under Bush after he invaded Iraq. Also, as I recall, there was no Guantanamo, no Afghanistan war and no Iraq war on Sept. 10, 2001. And yet, somehow, Osama bin Ladin had no trouble recruiting back then. Can we retire the ""it will help them recruit"" argument yet? The reason not to burn Qurans is that it's unkind -- not to jihadists, but to Muslims who mean us no harm. The same goes for building a mosque at ground zero -- in both cases, it's not a question of anyone's ""rights,"" it's just a nasty thing to do.","Global Warming Is Driving Polar Bears Toward Extinction, Researchers Say",mixture,

Data from the Office for National Statistics also said the proportion of over-65s in debt rose from 12 to 16 percent from 2012 to 2016. The Labour Party research is likely to raise concern that many pensioners had been struggling financially before this year’s cost-of-living squeeze struck.  Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said PM Boris Johnson had “no credible plan to help retired people with rocketing heating bills and price rises”.  Mr Ashworth said it would be a “bleak, tough year for retired people”. He said Labour would save OAPs up to £600 a year by scrapping winter energy bill VAT and offering targeted extra help.  The research follows separate data earlier this year, showing pensioners already pay twice as much for energy as those under 30.  It means older households face being hardest hit by the 54 percent rise in the Ofgem energy bills cap due in April.  Under the change, a typical household including at least one person over 65 will face an increase of around £700 a year.

5285404b,Home Run King Hank Aaron Dies of ‘Undisclosed Cause’ 18 Days After Receiving Moderna Vaccine,"Baseball legend Hank Aaron, who received the Moderna COVID vaccine on Jan. 5, has died. According to the New York Times, the Atlanta Braves confirmed the 86-year-old Hall of Famer’s death today, but did not provide further details. CNN reported that Aaron died “peacefully in his sleep,” and that no cause of death was disclosed. Aaron made headlines earlier this month when he was photographed getting the Moderna vaccine. He told the Associated Press at the time that getting vaccinated “makes me feel wonderful.” He added: “I don’t have any qualms about it at all, you know. I feel quite proud of myself for doing something like this. … It’s just a small thing that can help zillions of people in this country.” Aaron was vaccinated at the Morehouse School of Medicine health clinic in Atlanta, in what news reports said was an attempt to inspire other Black Americans to step up to the plate and get the vaccine. The AP reported at the time: “Rolling up their sleeves to take the first of two doses, these octogenarians, their spouses and several other civil rights leaders who received the shots in a brand-new health clinic at the Morehouse School of Medicine acknowledged the legacy of mistrust that many African Americans have toward medical research, stemming from the infamous Tuskegee experiment in which U.S. health workers left syphilis untreated in Black men without their consent, making them suffer needlessly.” In December, VOX reported on the launch of a global campaign using influencers and celebrities to help overcome “vaccine hesitancy,” stating that it “will be unprecedented” and many institutions will have a role, including government and public health authorities. However, health officials continue to encounter pushback, including from healthcare workers. Adverse events to the COVID vaccine have been reported worldwide. Germany and Norway have reported a combined 43 deaths among elderly people who received the Pfizer vaccine, prompting China health officials to call for the vaccines to be suspended, especially among the elderly. On learning of Aaron’s death, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., chairman and chief legal counsel for Children’s Health Defense, said: “Aaron’s tragic death is part of a wave of suspicious deaths among elderly closely following administration of COVID vaccines.” “Studies show that self-interested pharmaceutical company researchers, physicians, nursing homes and health officials seldom report vaccine injuries. Instead, they dismiss injuries and deaths as ‘unrelated’ to vaccination,” Kennedy said. “Public health advocates worry that the vast majority of injuries and deaths will go unreported to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), the notoriously broken voluntary surveillance system run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).” A 2001 HHS study concluded that “fewer than 1% of vaccine injuries” are reported to VAERS. As The Defender reported last week, California was forced to recall a batch of 330,000 Moderna vaccines after a cascade of reported injuries, though now the company says it’s okay to resume administration of that batch. The Defender also covered the story of a 56-year-old Florida doctor who died about two weeks after getting his first dose of Pfizer’s vaccine. His death is under investigation by Florida health officials. In addition, multiple severe allergic reactions have been directly linked to the Pfizer vaccine.",mixture,

Upon the launch of the ads, the Republican Party of Wisconsin is releasing the following statement from Executive Director Mark Morgan:  “Whether it’s Tony Evers failing families, Matt Flynn bullying victims of sexual abuse, Mahlon Mitchell abusing his position, or Kelda Roys putting families in danger, Democrats are locked into a dangerous race to the left. Wisconsin voters can’t trust any one of these candidates to keep them safe or fight for their best interests.”  The ads will initially run in markets statewide, targeting Democrat candidates for governor Tony Evers, Matt Flynn, Mahlon Mitchell, and Kelda Roys. Listen to the ads below:  “Failed,” On Tony Evers Failing Families:  LISTEN HERE  FACTS ON AD HERE:  As Superintendent of Schools, Tony Evers sided with union bosses and failed to take the license of a teacher who was found to be spreading pornography at school and making inappropriate comments about the bodies of middle school girls – despite outcry from parents.  In a similar case from before he was an elected official, Evers signed off on a license revocation for a teacher watching pornography at school – showing Evers failed to consistently implement the law and that his excuses for inaction on previous cases ring hollow.  “Silent,” On Matt Flynn Bullying Victims of Abuse:  LISTEN HERE  FACTS ON AD HERE:  As a defense attorney, Flynn threatened to throw victims of sexual abuse “crumbs.”  A letter unveiled by the Republican Party of Wisconsin detailed how Flynn provided sexual predators with direct legal counsel.  Despite all of this, most of his fellow Democrat candidates for governor have failed to call on Flynn to drop out of the race.  “Abusing,” On Mahlon Mitchell Abusing His Position:  LISTEN HERE  FACTS ON AD HERE:  As a union boss, Mahlon Mitchell took a massive raise on the backs of hard-working Wisconsin firefighters.  Mitchell used his union’s political arm as his own political slush funded, donating to far-left candidates and causes.

,"Iran’s foreign minister has ringed the alarm about Israel’s presence in the Caucasus, stressing Tehran will not tolerate a geopolitical change in the region.  “The Islamic Republic of Iran is deeply concerned by Israel’s presence in the Caucasus,” Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said on Wednesday, stressing, Tehran “will not accept a map change in the region.”  He made the remarks at a press conference with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Moscow.  He added that Iran expects Russia to be sensitive to any potential changes in the borders in the region and the presence of terrorists and movements of the Zionist regime that threaten regional peace and stability.  The remarks came in reaction to recent developments along Iran’s northwestern borders and the latest remarks by Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev.  Iran launched a drill, codenamed Fatehan-e Kheybar (Conquerors of Khaybar), in the northwest of the country on Friday, in line with efforts to boost its defense and deterrent capabilities in the face of potential threats.  Aliyev criticized the drills, but Iran reiterated that it reserves the right, just like any other sovereign country, to hold military exercises inside its territory to test and maintain its preparedness.  Amir-Abdollahian said the Republic of Azerbaijan has held six maneuvers with some foreign parties, but Iran held only one exercise.  In addition to the presence of Daesh terrorists in the region, Iran has been suspicious of Azerbaijan’s links to the Israeli regime, too.  Elsewhere in the presser, Amir-Abdollahian said, Iran and Russia “have agreed to discuss a treaty on strategic cooperation in the future, and soon, we will have a draft and we will issue a road map that will be the basis of our long-term cooperation.”  He lauded the bilateral ties between the two countries but underlined the need to “make a leap” in the promotion of cooperation.  He also praised his “fruitful” talks with his Russian counterpart on regional issues, including Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen and the Palestinian issue.  “We support the establishment of an inclusive government with all stakeholders included,” he commented on Afghanistan.  He also said that Tehran was ready to make arrangements for Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Grossi for a visit to Tehran.  “We welcome any visit by the IAEA head to follow up on technical issues,” Amir-Abdollahian said, but expressed Iran’s dismay over the failure of the UN nuclear agency to condemn the terrorist incident at a nuclear facility in Karaj in north-central Iran.  For his part, Lavrov said he discussed with his Iranian counterpart specific ways to expand cooperation between the two countries “in bilateral projects based on the agreements achieved on the highest level.”  “We have a stable growth of trade, which despite the COVID-19 pandemic and sanctions increased by 42 percent” this year, he said, adding, “We have agreed to boost our economic cooperation further and develop economic ties.”  He also rejected US push for a West-style world order, stressing, “We oppose the rules-based world order that is promoted by the US and its Western allies that are trying to impose [it] on all international players.”  On the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the top Russian diplomat underscored the necessity for the implementation by all sides of UN Security Council resolution 2231 that endorses the agreement.  He also said the talks in Vienna aimed at reviving the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) should be resumed as quickly as possible.  He echoed Iran’s stances that expect the US to resume its obligations according to the Iranian deal, but dismissed Washington’s expectation of Tehran to make certain changes so the US would re-enter the deal.  “As for the expectations of the US that Iran should make certain changes for the US to re-enter the deal, it is something that we do not accept and that Iran does not accept,” Lavrov said.  He also said Iran and Russia see eye to eye over the fact that the US worsened the situation in Afghanistan in the past 20 years.  “Both countries believe that the people of Afghanistan have suffered a lot over the two decades of political experiments carried out by the US,” he said, adding that the Afghans “have the right to freely decide the future of their land.”  “We believe that political stabilization is important to reach this goal,” he further commented.  Amir-Abdollahian’s visit to Moscow is his first since taking office as Iran’s foreign minister.","Iran concerned by Israel presence in Caucasus, will not accept any geopolitical change in region: FM",mixture,271429858150461644823058958655330103268
4ebbbb28,"Global warming skeptics sometimes say rising temperatures are just another naturally occurring shift in Earth’s climate, like the Medieval Warm Period of the years 800 to 1200 or the Little Ice Age, a period of cooling that spanned from roughly 1300 to 1850.  But a pair of studies published Wednesday provides stark evidence that the rise in global temperatures over the past 150 years has been far more rapid and widespread than any warming period in the past 2,000 years — a finding that undercuts claims that today’s global warming isn’t necessarily the result of human activity.  “The familiar maxim that the climate is always changing is certainly true,” Scott St. George, a physical geographer at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, said in a written commentary about the studies. “But even when we push our perspective to the earliest days of the Roman Empire, we cannot discern any event that is remotely equivalent — either in degree or extent — to the warming over the last few decades.”  Since the beginning of the 20th century, the global average temperature on Earth has risen by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. A consensus of climate scientists pins the increase primarily on the burning of fossil fuels, which spews carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the air. In the absence of concerted efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the United Nations says, the global average temperature could rise an additional 5.4 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100.  One of the studies, published in the journal Nature, shows that the Little Ice Age and other natural fluctuations affected only limited regions of the planet at a time, making modern warming the first and only planetwide warm period in the past two millennia. The other study, published in Nature Geoscience, shows that the rate of modern warming has far outpaced changes that occurred before the rise of the industrial era.  For the research, a team led by Raphael Neukom, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bern’s Institute of Geography in Switzerland, analyzed 2,000 years' worth of climate data. In the absence of direct temperature information — thermometer measurements were scarce before the middle of the 19th century — the scientists looked at data on old trees’ growth rings, layers of glacier ice and the remnants of corals, whose layers have different chemical compositions depending on the temperature of seawater.  The Nature study mapped the temperature fluctuations across the planet, finding, for example, that the Little Ice Age didn’t affect the whole world at once. Temperatures bottomed out in the Pacific Ocean around 1500, the scientists found; Europe and North America didn’t fully chill out for another two centuries.  The same pattern was observed for the higher temperatures seen during the Medieval Warm Period. The researchers found that less than half of the planet felt the heat at once.  The research indicates that during the current period of warming, more than 98 percent of the Earth’s surface has experienced record high temperatures. The finding shows just how dramatically today’s global rise in temperatures differs from previous periods of temperature change, the scientists said.  “What we show is that these periods aren’t globally coherent as previously thought,” said Nathan Steiger, a climate scientist at Columbia University in New York City and a co-author of the Nature study. The current period of warming “stands in stark contrast” to today’s warming, he added, calling it “a globally coherent warm period that is very different from what we see in the past.”  For the Nature Geoscience study, the researchers charted global temperature averages over time, and then compared the data to a set of climate simulations to figure out what might have driven the changes. Neukom and his colleagues found that the fastest warming in the last two millennia occurred during the second half of the 20th century.  The researchers also found that the main cause of temperature fluctuations changed over time. Prior to 1850, fluctuations were mainly linked to volcanic eruptions, which cooled the planet by spewing sun-blocking ash into the stratosphere; after 1850, greenhouse gas emissions took the wheel.  “It’s exciting to see studies like this that combine rigorous statistics with huge databases to make clear conclusions about past climate change,” said Gabriela Serrato Marks, a graduate student in paleoclimatology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who wasn't involved in the new research.  Serrato Marks said the records the researchers used could be incomplete, adding that subsequent research could benefit from more robust data. “Future studies will be strengthened even more with data from the Southern Hemisphere and more high-resolution data,” she said.  Jennifer Hertzberg, a paleoclimatologist at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, who wasn’t involved in the research, called the study “very important” and praised its use of multiple statistical methods to reconstruct temperature change over time. She urged the public to take the results to heart.  “The global temperatures that we’re seeing now are higher than they have been in the last 2,000 years,” she said. “What we’re seeing now is uncharted territory. It’s time for everybody to wake up and make changes now.”  Want more stories about science?

It was said today that Tory whips, who usually pair up people who can't vote because of illness so their absence doesn't affect crunch votes, were refusing to do today, meaning that sick people were forced to come in and be counted. Long-standing traditions usually allow sick MPs to be nodded through without them virtually having to walk through the lobbies physically. They can be driven into the grounds of Parliament and counted by whips without having to get out of the car. But a Labour spokesperson said their requests to do this today had been refused. Just one Labour MP was allowed to miss the vote, and was paired up with a Tory MP. Heavily pregnant Cat Smith MP, who was forced into hospital last night, was told she can't travel and was spared from voting today. But her colleague Laura Pidcock - who is herself eight months pregnant, was made to come in. She told BuzzFeed: This week, though, with my due date a matter of a few weeks away, and in extreme discomfort – the baby is lying on my sciatic nerve – I have had to struggle in to parliament, aided by a wheelchair at times, only to be checked out by government whips to make sure that I’m not faking it.",Breaking: Okonjo-Iweala appointed 1st female leader of WTO,mixture,
03a10122,"CORRECTION: This article has been updated to indicate that other fire suppression policies, which allow forests to accumulate kindling, predated then-President Bill Clinton’s rules. It has also been updated to include arguments that climate change is increasing the severity of wildfires in the West. Additionally, a previous version of this article stated that an average of 10 million feet of timber was removed each year from Forest Service land between 1960 and 1990. The actual number was 10.3 billion. The article has been updated to reflect the change. This post has also been updated to clarify that wildfire fuels such as underbrush increased after Clinton’s Northwest Forest Plan, though logging can, in some instances, increase the risk of forest fires. A citation to a study noting that the plan was inconsistent with managing fire-frequent forests was also added to this post. Former President Bill Clinton’s land management rules and other liberal policies paved the way for future debilitating wildfires, fire expert Bob Zybach told the Daily Caller News Foundation. Zybach warned of potential disastrous wildfires shortly after Clinton signed a slate of rules in the mid-1990s that, according to a study published in the Ecological Society of America in 2019, was “inconsistent with management for … historically fire-frequent forests.” Zybach’s comments come as California, Oregon, and parts of Washington deal with catastrophic wildfires that have killed 26 people and destroyed buildings.
Former President Bill Clinton made a significant change to federal land management nearly 30 years ago that created conditions necessary to increase the severity of wildfires on the West Coast, according to one fire expert who predicted the problem years ago.
Shortly before leaving office in 2001, Clinton limited the ability of the United States Forest Service to thin out a dense thicket of foliage and downed trees on federal land to bring the West into a pristine state, Bob Zybach, an experienced forester with a PhD in environmental science, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. The former president’s decision created a ticking time bomb, Zybach argues.
“If you don’t start managing these forests, then they are going to start burning up. Thirty years later, they are still ignoring it,” said Zybach, who spent more than 20 years as a reforestation contractor. He was referring to warnings he made years ago, telling officials that warding off prescribed burns in Oregon and California creates kindling fueling fires. Such rules make it more difficult to deploy prescribed burns, which are controlled burns designed to cull all of the underbrush in forests to lessen the chance of massive fires, Zybach noted. Years of keeping these areas in their natural state result in dead trees and dried organic material settling on the forest floor, turning such material into matchsticks soaked in jet fuel during dry seasons, he said.
Zybach’s comments come as wildfires continue churning through parts of California, Oregon and Washington, media reports show. Fires have killed 26 people in West Coast states since August, including 19 people in California, and have culminated in more than half-a-million people evacuating Oregon, a number representing roughly 10% of the state’s overall population.
Roughly 100 massive fires are blazing Saturday in the West, including 12 in Idaho and nine in Montana, the National Interagency Fire Center said Saturday. All told, the wildfires have churned through more than 4.5 million acres in 12 states. (RELATED: Wildfires, Blackouts And High Gas Prices: Californians Fight Familiar Foes Amid Pandemic) Shortly before leaving office, Clinton introduced the Roadless Rule that restricted the use of existing roads and construction of new roads on 49 million acres of National Forest, making it difficult for officials to scan the land for the kind of kindling that fuels massive conflagrations.
The move was part of the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP), a resolution adopted by Clinton in 1994 in order to settle ongoing disputes between economic and environmental interests, according to The New York Times. The plan was intended to protect certain portions of forests while allowing logging in others. But the plan was “inconsistent with management for ecological integrity in the dry, historically fire‐frequent forests” that make up portions of the protected forests, according to a study published in the Ecological Study of America in 2019. Meanwhile, fire suppression policies, which began at the beginning of the 20th century, have allowed kindling to accumulate in forests, according to The Guardian.
Ten years before Clinton’s rule, the Fish and Wildlife Service placed the northern spotted owl on the Endangered Species Act, forcing the Forest Service to adopt a new policy that resulted in a greater reduction in timber harvests. The amount of timber removed from federal lands plummeted, according to data accumulated in 2015 by the Reason Foundation. An average of 10.3 billion feet of timber was removed each year from Forest Service land between 1960 and 1990, the data show. Those numbers dropped between 1991 and 2000 and continued dropping — an average of only 2.1 billion feet of timber was removed from the land between 2000 and 2013, according to the data. That’s an 80% decline.
And while logging can be an ineffective method to preventing forest fires and can, in some instances, cause an increase, according to the BBC, the Times reported that, following the Northwest Forest Plan, wildfire risk grew along with fuels like combustable trees and underbrush. Actions like “thinning and prescribed fire to reduce fuel continuity” would “promote ecological integrity” in certain portions of forests protected under the plan, according to the Ecological Society of America study.
“They’ve gone and left hundreds of thousands of acres of burnt timber, a fire bomb waiting to happen, standing in place because the black back woodpecker prefers that habitat,” Zybach said. “It’s great for lawyers, but it’s bad for people who breathe air or work in the woods.” “The prescribed burns are an ancient form of management for keeping the fuels down so these events don’t happen,” Zybach added, referring to Native American Indians who used controlled burns to ward away pests and prevent wildfires from licking their homes. The Clinton administration’s plan to turn forests in the West into pristine land free of human interference risked fueling “wildfires reminiscent of the Tillamook burn, the 1910 fires and the Yellowstone fire,” Zybach, who is based in Oregon, told Evergreen magazine in 1994, when the NWFP came into effect.
Western Oregon had one major fire above 10,000 acres between 1952 and 1987, reports show. The Silver Complex Fire of 1987 snapped that streak after torching more than 100,000 acres in the Kalmiopsis Wilderness area, killing rare plants and trees the federal government sought to protect from human activities.
And the Mendocino Complex Fire is spreading across California and is on its way to becoming the largest wildfire in the state, engulfing more than 283,000 acres.
Zybach said he believes land management, rather than climate change, is increasing the severity of Western wildfires, noting that climate change has little to do with kindling gathering on forest floors.
University of Washington climate scientist Cliff Mass told the DCNF in 2018 that “the key factors are mismanaged forests, years of fire suppression, increased population, people living where they should not, invasive flammable species, and the fact that California has always had fire.” Other scientists, however, say climate change is the driving cause as summer heat intensifies and further dries out dead brush on forest floors.
The Washington Post reported that the West is becoming hotter, drier and and more susceptible to large blazes. It also pointed to an August study that found fall days in California with extreme fire-weather conditions had more than doubled since the 1980s.
“I can’t say it was unexpected what happened there, but the speed with which it went was mind-blowing to a lot of us,” a U.S. Forest Service research ecologist, Eric Knapp, told the Post, referring to the Creek Fire. Climate change increased the likelihood and severity of a drought that killed trees ahead of the fire in that region, according to the Post.
Meanwhile, former President Barack Obama tweeted: “The fires across the West Coast are just the latest examples of the very real ways our changing climate is changing our communities.”
Similarly, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer tweeted: “The proof of the urgency of the climate crisis is literally in the air around us.” The New York Democrat included a link to a Sept. 10 article from CBS blaming climate change for the fires.
Fire Experts Agree: Prescribed Burns Are Critical, Experts Say
Overzealous fire suppression across California are helping to build up wildland fuels, which contribute to wildfires, according to Tim Ingalsbee, a fire ecologist who began a career in the 1980s as a wildland firefighter. The solution is “to get good fire on the ground and whittle down some of that fuel load,” he told ProPublica in August.
“It’s just … well … it’s horrible. Horrible to see this happening when the science is so clear and has been clear for years. I suffer from Cassandra syndrome,” Ingalsbee said, referring to a Greek metaphor people use when they believe their valid warnings are ignored.
“Every year I warn people: Disaster’s coming,” he said. “We got to change. And no one listens. And then it happens.”
Other experts have made similar arguments in the past. (RELATED: Decades Of Mismanagement Turned US Forests Into ‘Slow-Motion Time Bombs’)
A US forestry firefighter cools a burning modular home to protect a nearby structure in Deerhorn Valley as the Harris Fire continues growing beyond 70,000 acres on October 24, 2007 near Jamul, California. Southern California is being ravaged by numerous record wildfires as Santa Ana Wind conditions push them into communities surrounded by native Chaparral habitat that has been dried by the driest rain season since records began 130 years ago. The fires are shaping up to be the worst wildfire event in San Diego County history. As many as 500,000 people have been evacuated from their homes. 
Overgrown grasslands, forests, and woodlands contributed to California wildfires in 2017, Sasha Berleman, a fire ecologist, told High Country News that year.
“I’m more certain than ever that there’s a lot we can do between now and the next time this happens to make it so that the negative consequences to people are nowhere near as dramatic,” she said.
The devastating fires that ran through California’s wine country in October of 2017 killed 42 people and destroyed nearly 7,000 buildings, High Country News noted.
The solution might be easier said than done. Nearly 20 million acres in California, or an area about the size of Maine, will need to experience controlled burns to limit catastrophic wildfires, a January study from Nature Sustainability found.

MYCHAJLIW ERIE COUNTY COMPTROLLER’S OFFICE DIVISION OF AUDIT & CONTROL 95 FRANKLIN STREET BUFFALO, NEW YORK 14202 January 29, 2021 Erie County Legislature 92 Franklin Street 4th Floor Buffalo, New York 14202 Dear Honorable Members: The Erie County Comptroller’s Office has completed a report on certain personnel and food expenses charged to fund 252, commonly known as CARES Act relief for municipalities. Our objectives were to: Update the amount of expenses for overtime attributed to fund 252. List Managerial Confidential recipients of overtime payments. Update the amount expended for food from fund 252. To accomplish these objectives, we reviewed expenses attributed to fund 252. This report serves as both an update to previous reports regarding overtime expensed to fund 252, as well as food expenses. A meeting scheduled prior to the August break to discuss overtime was postponed, with the intent to meet soon for the discussion. To date, this meeting has not yet been rescheduled. This updated information may be useful at such a discussion when it occurs. Further, the updated information will be useful in any discussions concerning food purchased using fund 252, especially food for employees. Background On March 25, 2020, the United States Senate passed the “Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act” (CARES) as amended. The United States House of Representatives approved the measure on the following day, and the bill was signed into law on March 27, 2020.
The CARES Act provided significant aid to local governments to combat COVID-19. Erie County received $160 million in federal funding. Erie County created a special fund to account for expenses permissibly reimbursed by CARES Act governmental funding. The fund is identified as fund 252. The money in fund 252 can be used for various purposes related to combatting COVID 19. These purposes include wages to individuals who tasks are to substantially address COVID 19, outfitting offices and other areas to reduce potential exposure to COVID-19, fortifying capacity to work remotely to avoid exposure to COVID-19, and supplies and protective gear to guard against COVID-19, to name just a few permissible uses. As stated, a permissible use of CARES Act funding is to pay employees whose efforts are substantially devoted to addressing COVID-19. As a result, some employees have been hired specifically for such tasks, while others have been authorized overtime for such tasks. The tasks needed to address COVID-19 are varied, and may be different from tasks typically undertaken by employees in their daily activities. At the time of passage, municipalities were required to spend the funds by December 31, 2020. In December, 2020, the deadline was extended so that funds that were determined to not be needed in 2020 must now be expended by December 31, 2021. At the prompting of legislature questions and commentary, our office has previously submitted reports quantifying overtime and holiday worked pay expended to MC employees, overtime and holiday worked pay expended to employees represented by bargaining units, pay for employees who did not report to work and were unable to perform work remotely, the utilization of the imprest fund for expenditures charged to fund 252, and the use of fund 252 for food purchases for individuals quarantining due to COVID-19, as well as employees who report to work. This report focuses serves as an update on overtime, including holiday worked overtime, associated with fund 252, as well as expenditures for food charged to fund 252. It synthesizes, as well as updates, information previously provided. CARES Act Guidance Regarding Expenditures Guidance provided by the United States Treasury Department regarding the CARES Act (updated January 15, 2021) in its Coronavirus Relief Fund Guidance for State, Territorial, Local, and Tribal Governments states that: The CARES Act provides that payments from the Fund may only be used to cover costs that – 1. are necessary expenditures incurred due to the public health emergency with respect to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19); 2. were not accounted for in the budget most recently approved as of March 27, 2020 (the date of enactment of the CARES Act) for the State or government; and 3. were incurred during the period that begins on March 1, 2020, and ends on December 30, 2021. The previous deadline for expending CARES Act funds was December 31, 2020; however, the deadline was extended by a year pursuant to section 1001 of Division N of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. Further, “[t]he statute also specifies that expenditures using Fund payments must be ‘necessary.’ The Department of the Treasury understands this term broadly to mean that the expenditure is reasonably necessary for its intended use in the reasonable judgment of the government officials responsible for spending Fund payments.” Overtime For the purposes of this report, overtime will refer to both overtime and holiday worked overtime charged to fund 252. As of the pay period ending January 1, 2021 and paid on January 8, 2021, 1,226 employees have charged 114,524 hours of overtime to fund 252, resulting in an expenditure of $5,898,195. Of this amount, $1,362,396 has been paid to 56 MC employees. This amounts to 23.1% of overtime payments to employees. MC employees comprise 6.5% of the county workforce. While the process for allocating overtime to union represented employees is outlined in labor contracts, MC employees are not bound to the terms of those contracts for overtime assignment purposes. The following are overtime payments in excess of $10,000 made to MC employees from fund 252: Office Title Hours Amount Health Commissioner of Health 1266 $183,414

Of the MC employees receiving more than $10,000 in overtime payments, 14 ultimately report to the County Executive and 13 ultimately report to the Sheriff. Although paid overtime for most MC employees was unusual prior to March, 2020, a recently implemented policy has increased the amount of compensatory time that MC employees may accumulate to 200 hours.
CARES Act Guidance Regarding Meals
In the only reference to food in the previously mentioned guidance, it states “Expenses of actions to facilitate compliance with COVID-19-related public health measures, such as: Expenses for food delivery to residents, including, for example, senior citizens and other vulnerable populations, to enable compliance with COVID-19 public health precautions.” It does not mention food expenses for employees. This guidance clearly permits food expenses for individuals housed in the hotel rented by the County for individuals with no other safe housing options and who are battling COVID-19. This qualification as a permissible expense is bolstered by the guidance listing among permissible expenses “expenses for quarantining individuals.”
However, it does not provide entire clarity as to the permissibility of paying for food for employees out of fund 252. Certainly, such expenditures qualify in that they were not otherwise budgeted to occur. Erie County does not typically provide food for employees who arrive for work and are present during a typical meal time. However, given legal and contractual requirements regarding break time for meals, questions may arise as to whether such expenditures are “necessary.” Further, listed examples of ineligible expenditures include “[w]orkforce bonuses other than hazard pay or overtime.” Although bonuses are typically thought of as extraordinary cash payments above and beyond salary, the definition of bonus may also include the provision of food not typically provided to employees in their compensation package. As such, WE RECOMMEND that clarification be sought from the federal government as to whether the CARES Act permits reimbursement for food expenses for employees while at work. Particular guidance should be requested regarding employees who are working their normal shift, which ordinarily includes a meal period.
New York State Guidance Regarding Meals
In order to properly reimburse for meals, proper documentation is necessary. These documents typically include an invoice, receipt or some other document which evidences what food was delivered and paid for, a statement of the purpose of the meeting, and a description (list) of the individuals in attendance.
The New York State Office of the Comptroller has opined that meal expenses are a proper charge to local governments if the local official is traveling outside of his or her regular work area on official business for an extended period of time or is prevented from taking time off for meals due to a pressing need to complete the business at hand. Clarifying this, the Comptroller opined that when the local government is faced with business of an immediate nature and meetings are essential at mealtime, meals would be a proper local government charge. However, the cost of meals while performing the usual duties of the position within the local government is generally a personal expense. Further, the Office of the New York State Comptroller has ruled that a municipality may make reasonable expenditures for refreshments which are incidental to a lawful municipal purpose. Examples of such expenditures include refreshments for senior citizens incidental to a recreation program; refreshments for the general public attending an official town function, and refreshments for volunteer firefighters at the scene of a serious fire.
Information available in the County’s SAP system, which is our data processing system, does not provide sufficient information to determine if the expenditures were appropriate charges to local government. Departments submitting invoices for payment are responsible for attaching documentation which supports the expenditure to be paid. The supporting documentation should be attached electronically in SAP, along with the corresponding invoice. For example, for many of the expenditures, there was not sufficient information to determine what was actually purchased, which individuals received the meals and why the food purchase was necessary. Further, the descriptions include entries such as “lunch for fire academy,” “dinner for 9th floor phone bank,” “food for Rath EOC – various days,” “groceries for OPS room,” and “supplies for warehouse.” These vague descriptions do not provide enough information to evaluate if there was participation in meetings that were essential at meal time or if there was a concern of an immediate nature.
Because COVID-19 has been present in the community since March, it may be difficult to determine that the reason for the meal was of an immediate nature. Further, there may not be support for the necessity of scheduling meetings during mealtimes. In fact, there are very few mentions of food being for meetings, regardless of whether they were required to occur during mealtimes. Also, it appears from the vague descriptions that many times meals could be provided for employees for performing the work that they are there to perform, i.e. – the usual duties of the position.
Further, given contractual and legal requirements, employees must be given breaks for meals. Failure to offer such breaks, especially on a continued basis, may subject the County to liability for violations of labor law or grievances. If the employees are being given their required meal breaks, they have time to consume meals brought from home, delivered to their work site or picked-up from a nearby restaurant. The fact that food is being delivered to the worksites is an indication that employees have the capability to secure food from a restaurant, if they so choose.
Given New York State guidance, as well as contractual and legal obligations, WE RECOMMEND that clarification be sought as to whether it is permissible for employees to be provided with meals at government expense.
Summary of Expenditures
A representative list of food expenditures is attached as Appendix A. The list is a compilation of food expenditures actually paid through December 31, 2020. It does not include items for which invoices were received, but not yet paid. The total amount of food expenditures using the fund 252 is $239,689. Prior reports on food listed several observations. These observations included:
Sales Tax Paid: Erie County is a sales tax exempt entity. Sales tax paid was noted on several receipts. It is understood that some restaurants do not accept tax exempt certificates. However, retailers such as BJs Wholesale do accept such certificates. Efforts should be considered to minimize sales tax paid using taxpayer dollars.
Purchases of Non-Food Items: Among the purchases reimbursed were cooking implements, including burners, pots, pans, spatulas, and cutlery. These purchases, made by the warehouse, were then followed by the purchase of food, including uncooked meat. It may be surmised that the raw meat was then cooked using the kitchen equipment. If true, this may be not be appropriate for reimbursement from CARES Act funding, and may also be in violation of New York State Comptroller guidance. If an employee has time to prepare a meal from scratch, it is hard to argue that meals were necessary due to an immediate need of the job. It is advisable to determine whether these expenditures were necessary and appropriate.
Purchases Prior to CARES Act: As stated above, CARES Act funding for municipalities can be used for eligible expenditures between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. A receipt reimbursed to Health Department – Bioterrorism was dated February 18, 2020, and another on February 22, 2020. These would seem to be outside of the parameters for CARES Act spending.
Communal Food: Many of the food items purchased for consumption were communal in nature, meaning that the food was meant to be shared by multiple people. An example of shared communal food would be a sheet pizza or sandwich platter. The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), in documenting recommendations for returning to work during the COVID-19 emergency, states that “[e]mployers and employees should not provide communal meals to employees, and should not make food available in common areas where employees may congregate.” As such, communal food should be discouraged. Notably, a large amount of food purchased does appear to be individually packaged meals.
Possible Duplicate Payment – Wellington Pub: On the entire list of entries, there were entries recorded depicting credits or refunds for overpayments made in error. This is not an uncommon practice during a reconciliation process. It was observed that a payment was made to Wellington Pub for 55 box lunches delivered to the SH Hotel on May 3, 2020, with a check number of 5716 (reference number 05032020-0001). It was also observed that a payment was made to Wellington Pub for 55 box lunches delivered to the SH Hotel on May 3, 2020, with a check number of 5716 (reference number 2020VF-119). A corresponding credit was not noted. It may be advisable to confirm that payments were made properly.
Duplicate Payment - ECC: It was observed that a payment was made to ECC Food Service for 72 Swedish meatball dinners picked up on May 13, 2020 (reference number 400-4847). It was also observed that a payment was made to ECC Food Service for 72 Swedish meatball dinners picked up on May 13, 2020 (reference number 400-7847). The two pick-ups would represent roughly double the amount of dinners picked-up from ECC Food Service on days around that time. Further, typically only one pick-up occurred daily from ECC Food Service. A corresponding credit was not noted. It may be advisable to confirm that payments were made properly.
Delivery expenses: The majority of food purchased was delivered, with delivery included in the final cost. Some food was picked-up. The cost of the food picked-up does not include the cost of labor or other resources used to retrieve the food. Although not known, it is possible that some individuals received overtime for the time spent picking-up food. As such, any analysis of food costs should consider the unreported costs.
Supporting Information Not Available on SAP: As stated above, there is a lack of documentation available on SAP. Some items do not have receipts attached to SAP to determine what was actually purchased. Other items provide important information, such as items purchased, cost per unit, date, location, etc., however there is no information as to the number of individuals consuming the purchased food. The lack of such readily available information could prove problematic in a future audit.
The above concerns have not yet been addressed to the Comptroller’s Office. In fact, certain concerns continue, such as the purchase of raw food products for the warehouse, most recently in November.
Conclusions
The CARES Act provides Erie County with $160 million to combat COVID-19. The funds are to be used for COVID-19 related expenses that were not otherwise anticipated in the budget. The Comptroller’s Office has previously provided updates to the Legislature concerning certain aspects of CARES Act spending, at the request of the Legislature. This report serves as an update to those previous reports.
As of the pay period ending January 1, 2021 and paid on January 8, 2021, 1,226 employees have charged 114,524 hours of overtime to fund 252, resulting in an expenditure of $5,898,195. Of this amount, $1,362,396 has been paid to 56 MC employees. The highest recipient of overtime received $183,414. This amount, compared to base the pay of all Erie County employees, would put that employee in the top five of over 4,700 employees. That top five list would also include that employee’s base salary of $202,312. A previous report to the legislature noted the comparatively low use of overtime for MC employees across New York State, when compared to Erie County. Most counties, including Erie County’s typical comparator counties, did not pay overtime to MC employees at all.
As of December 31, 2020, fund 252 expenditures for food total $239,689. This amount includes a high percentage spent on food for employees. Further, observations were made questioning the propriety of the spending.
As such, WE RECOMMEND that the propriety of using CARES Act funds to supply employee meals be examined, with particular attention given to the CARES Act, New York State Comptroller guidance, labor law and contractual obligations. Further, WE RECOMMEND that the observations made in Comm. 16D-1 (2020) be reviewed and any necessary corrections be made. In addition, WE RECOMMEND that steps be taken to reduce the usage of tax dollars for the payment of sales tax. WE RECOMMEND that overtime policies be revisited to make sure that payments were consistent with policies that existed at the time of payment. WE RECOMMEND that policies and safeguards be examined to determine how better to protect taxpayer money.

142069c9,"One in four women develop mental health problems while pregnant, a study has found. Awareness is growing about post-natal depression – but few people know problems can arrive before the baby is born. Researchers at King’s College London diagnosed mental health problems among 27 per cent of pregnant women. Using a gold-standard psychological screening technique at midwife appointments, they found 11 per cent of women had depression, 15 per cent had anxiety, 2 per cent had eating disorders and 2 per cent obsessive-compulsive disorders, with many women having combinations of different problems. These are usually missed because people wrongly believe women always suffer a feel-good ‘glow’ when they become pregnant. One in four women develop mental health problems while pregnant, a study has found. Awareness is growing about post-natal depression – but few people know problems can arrive before the baby is born ‘This is a myth,’ said researcher Professor Louise Howard, of the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience at King’s. ‘People think that pregnancy is protective of mental health, and then the post-natal period is a trigger for problems. But in reality problems start during pregnancy or even earlier – it is very common.’ She said rare and serious forms of mental disorders – such as severe post-natal psychosis – may be triggered by childbirth. But less severe depression and anxiety are likely to start during pregnancy itself. Clinical psychologist Dr Camilla Rosan of the Mental Health Foundation, an expert in maternity, said pregnancy was a huge transformation in a woman’s life. ‘It’s a time of lots of changes,’ she said. ‘There is a major renegotiation of a woman’s identity, anxiety about what kind of mother she might be, and it sometimes reactivates problems from her own childhood. These are all potential triggers – and old traumas and pre-existing problems can also return.’ Crucially, she said, women are at a vulnerable point in their lives. And the impacts of depression or anxiety can have lasting effects on women and babies. ‘When you experience stress when you are pregnant it leads to changes in levels of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. Studies show these can have an impact on the development of the growing baby' She said: ‘When you experience stress when you are pregnant it leads to changes in levels of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. Studies show these can have an impact on the development of the growing baby – it can affect their later academic achievements and cause problems with the development of emotional relationships.’ The study, funded by the research arm of the NHS and published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, involved 545 pregnant women in South London. Professor Howard said women are seen so often by medical professionals during pregnancy they should never slip through the net. Her study showed using proper psychological screening tools, based on simple questions about mood, could pick up problems. ‘In clinical practice, maternity professionals need to identify whether or not a woman has any mental disorder, not only mood disorders which until recently have been the main focus of concern. ‘Women should be asked, by a non-judgemental and supportive health professional, at all contacts in pregnancy and after birth about their emotional wellbeing.’",Poll: Sanders edging Clinton out in California,mixture,
5ae71da3,"Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, is strongly considering a bid for U.S. Senate, calculating that having Hillary Clinton at the top of the 2016 ticket would help lift her candidacy in a year-of-the-woman campaign.  Driving Wasserman Schultz’s interest: the increasing likelihood that Sen. Marco Rubio will run for the White House and that he ultimately won’t seek reelection in 2016, Democratic insiders familiar with her thinking say. Her office wouldn’t discuss her interest in the Senate.  “Of course she’s considering it: Open Senate seats are pretty rare,” said Andrew Weinstein, a longtime supporter of the Weston congresswoman and a 2012 member of President Barack Obama’s national finance team.  “If you’re a nationally known candidate with a strong fundraising record and a good relationship with your constituents and supporters, you would definitely look at it,” Weinstein added.  Like a number of Democratic insiders — four of whom spoke on condition of anonymity in confirming her Senate interest — Weinstein stressed he wasn’t favoring any potential candidate and didn’t want to appear to slight Rep. Patrick Murphy, who represents Florida’s 18th Congressional District and is considered the most likely Democrat to seek a Senate seat in 2016.  “He is very seriously considering the Senate race — whether Rubio runs or not,” said Eric Johnson, Murphy’s chief of staff and top political adviser.  Also expressing some interest behind the scenes: former Gov. Charlie Crist, who has lost his past two elections — governor in 2012 and Senate in 2010, the latter against Rubio. Crist, who couldn’t be reached, would be far less likely to run for the Senate again if he had to run against an incumbent Rubio.  The same is likely true of Wasserman Schultz, who’s in a safe seat.  Murphy sits in a far more competitive district, though he defeated his Republican opponent handily in 2014.  “It’s not a question of if he loses his seat, but when,” one Democratic consultant said of Murphy. “Make no mistake: He has won two hard races. He knows how to win. He can raise big money. That matters. So it makes sense he’ll run for Senate. And the [Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee] loves the guy.”  Wasserman Schultz has a fraught relationship with some Washington Democrats.  For years, anonymous Democrats in Congress, the DNC and Obama’s election machine have trashed the sometimes-acerbic congresswoman in publications like POLITICO and BuzzFeed.  “Nancy Pelosi views Debbie as a threat,” said one Democratic politician familiar with the dynamics in the U.S. House. “So perhaps they’ll all pitch in together to get her out of the DNC and out of the House and into the Senate where no one can really do anything.”  As DNC chair, Wasserman Schultz has major fundraising responsibilities nationwide. Democrats say she can’t realistically be a statewide Florida candidate — especially in a potentially contested primary — and fully serve the party at the same time. One Democrat said she could make the decision to leave the DNC no later than April.  Unlike many in Obama’s orbit, Wasserman Schultz has the aura of a Clinton-machine Democrat. She was Hillary Clinton’s co-chair for her 2008 race. Some Democrats have accused her of being disloyal to Clinton toward the end of the contest against Obama, but others say the relationship between the two women is strong.  Wasserman Schultz wouldn’t comment on the chatter. “My only focus right now is serving the people of Florida’s 23rd District in Congress and electing the 45th President of the United States,” she said in a statement.  Florida has had only one female U.S. senator, Republican Paula Hawkins, who served from 1981-87.  Some Democrats are salivating at the prospect of a history-making, two-woman top-of-the-ticket race in Florida. They also hope a female Senate candidate would attract unmarried female voters, who tend to vote Democrat but disproportionately avoid voting in Florida midterms along with African-Americans and Hispanics.  Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by 3.6 percentage points in Florida, yet the GOP controls the four statewide elected offices based in Tallahassee, one U.S. Senate seat, a supermajority in the state House and a majority in the state Senate — and that’s despite an anti-gerrymandering constitutional amendment voters approved in 2010.  Presidential election years are much kinder to Florida Democrats: Obama won the state twice, and Sen. Bill Nelson was easily reelected in 2012.  Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz | M. Scott Mahaskey  Wasserman Schultz’s supporters first whispered about her as a possible Senate pick during the 2012 cycle. Many wanted Nelson to run for governor and, if he won, to pick Wasserman Schultz as his replacement an appointment, however, that could have been disputed under Florida law.  The buzz died down as Crist’s candidacy surged, but it’s back now that Democrats believe Rubio is more serious about not seeking reelection if he pursues a White House run. Under state law, Rubio would have to choose which office to pursue.  Follow @politico  Rubio hasn’t completely pledged to not seek reelection if he runs for president. But he has almost shut the door on the possibility.  “If I’m running for president, I’m running for president,” Rubio told POLITICO. “That wouldn’t be my strategy or my thought or my plan. My plan would be to run for president to win.”  Rubio said he has no favored potential successor: “I think we have a deep bench of quality candidates. I’m sure a good one will be our nominee and will win it. I haven’t made that decision. But I anticipate when you are running for president, you have your hands full.”  A number of Republicans want more assurances before they start up plans to run. Among the possible GOP candidates: state CFO Jeff Atwater, former House Speaker Will Weatherford, Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera and U.S. Reps. Ron DeSantis and Vern Buchanan.  As for the Democrats, aside from Wasserman Schultz, Murphy and Crist, Miami Beach Mayor Phil Levine, independently wealthy and a friend of the Clintons, hasn’t tamped down speculation about his potential interest. Nor has U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch of Boca Raton.  Most top Florida Democrats say that Wasserman Schultz would be tough to beat because of her high name recognition and fundraising prowess. Top-tier Florida campaigns cost at least $10 million. Gov. Rick Scott spent the most, about $115 million in 2014, to defeat Crist by just 1.08 percentage points.  Wasserman Schultz’s post at the DNC has both pluses and minuses for a potential Senate candidacy. While she has greatly expanded her fundraising contact list and media profile, she also could be perceived as too much of a liberal partisan in conservative and moderate quarters of Florida.  “I hear from many people she is interested. I think her problem will be the notion of statewide,” Orlando trial lawyer John Morgan, an Obama donor, said by email. “She is very safe and popular inside her district but coming out from there will be a problem in my opinion. As chair of the DNC you are the attack dog for the party. It’s your job. You become polarizing.”  Morgan employs Crist in his law firm and said the Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat’s pollster, John Anzalone, has indicated that Crist might seek the Senate seat. Anzalone also polled for a medical-marijuana initiative Morgan underwrote in 2014, when it fell about 3 percentage points shy of the needed 60 percent voter-approval threshold for a state constitutional amendment.  Morgan and Wasserman Schultz had a public falling out over medical marijuana when he blasted her as an “irrelevant … irritant” once she echoed conservative criticisms of the initiative.  Medical marijuana isn’t the only surprisingly conservative position for the otherwise liberal congresswoman. For years, Wasserman Schultz has voted with most Republicans and against most Democrats in favor of keeping a hard line against Cuba’s Castro dictatorship. After Obama announced his plan to normalize relations, Wasserman Schultz’s statement was markedly delayed and tepid.  U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson spoke highly of Wasserman Schultz — even though he is eyeing a 2016 Senate bid as well.  “I would not run against Debbie Wasserman Schultz out of respect and admiration for her,” Grayson said in an interview. “She would be almost impossible to beat in a Democratic primary anyway.”  Grayson said he believed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, should he go ahead with a presidential bid in 2016, would have “coattails” for a Republican candidate in Florida, making it all the better to have a ticket led by Wasserman Schultz and Hillary Clinton, who bests Bush by inside-the-error-margin amounts in early Florida polls.  Asked if Wasserman Schultz were seriously considering a run, Grayson said “yes.” When asked whether the two had spoken about the matter, Grayson said he wouldn’t disclose private conversations.  The prospect of a Wasserman Schultz-Murphy primary for Senate could pit the two camps of the Florida Democratic Party against each other: Those who argue for a more centrist approach side with Murphy, and those who favor a candidacy that doesn’t shy away from liberalism are more in Wasserman Schultz’s camp.  The potentially open Senate seat puts Florida Democrats like Steve Schale in a tough spot. Schale, a fan of both Murphy and Wasserman Schultz, served as an adviser to Crist and newly elected U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham, who intends to run for reelection to her 2nd District seat.  Schale said some have dismissed the idea of Wasserman Schultz running, but they might be surprised.  “She’s considering [the] Senate far more seriously than many people are giving her credit for,” Schale said.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry speaking with Iranian officials including his counterpart, Javad Zarif, after the agreement was reached in Vienna in July 2015. WASHINGTON—The Obama administration secretly organized an airlift of $400 million worth of cash to Iran that coincided with the January release of four Americans detained in Tehran, according to U.S. and European officials and congressional staff briefed on the operation afterward. Wooden pallets stacked with euros, Swiss francs and other currencies were flown into Iran on an unmarked cargo plane, according to these officials. The U.S. procured the money from the central banks of the Netherlands and Switzerland, they said. The money represented the first installment of a $1.7 billion settlement the Obama administration reached with Iran to resolve a decades-old dispute over a failed arms deal signed just before the 1979 fall of Iran’s last monarch, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The settlement, which resolved claims before an international tribunal in The Hague, also coincided with the formal implementation that same weekend of the landmark nuclear agreement reached between Tehran, the U.S. and other global powers the summer before. “With the nuclear deal done, prisoners released, the time was right to resolve this dispute as well,” President Barack Obama said at the White House on Jan. 17—without disclosing the $400 million cash payment.","USA repeats as World Cup champions, beating Netherlands 2-0",mixture,

DUP economy minister Diane Dodds seemed fro[...],"We have detailed the controversy surrounding America's COVID ""casedemic"" and the misleading results of the PCR test and its amplification procedure in great detail over the past few months. As a reminder, ""cycle thresholds"" (Ct) are the level at which widely used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can detect a sample of the COVID-19 virus. The higher the number of cycles, the lower the amount of viral load in the sample; the lower the cycles, the more prevalent the virus was in the original sample. Numerous epidemiological experts have argued that cycle thresholds are an important metric by which patients, the public, and policymakers can make more informed decisions about how infectious and/or sick an individual with a positive COVID-19 test might be. However, as JustTheNews reports, health departments across the country are failing to collect that data. In fact, as far back as October, we brought the world's attention to the COVID-19 ""casedemic"" and the disturbing reality of high-cycle threshold PCR tests being worse than useless as indicators of COVID-19 ""sickness"". PJMedia's Stacey Lennox said at the time: Biden will issue national standards, like the plexiglass barriers in restaurants he spoke about during the debate, and pressure governors to implement mask mandates using the federal government’s financial leverage. Some hack at the CDC or FDA will issue new guidance lowering the Ct the labs use, and cases will magically start to fall. In reality, the change will only eliminate false positives, but most Americans won’t know that. Good old Uncle Joe will be the hero, even though it is Deep-State actors in the health bureaucracies who won’t solve a problem with testing they have been aware of for months. TDS is a heck of a drug. And now, as Lennox explains in detail below, we have been proved 100% correct as less than one hour after President Biden's inauguration, the WHO proved us right. In August of last year, The New York Times published an article stating that as many as 90% of COVID-19 tests in three states were not indicative of active illness. In other words, they were picking up viral debris incapable of causing infection or being transmitted because the cycle threshold (Ct) of the PCR testing amplified the sample too many times. Labs in the United States were using a Ct of 37-40. Epidemiologists interviewed at the time said a Ct of around 30 was probably more appropriate. This means the CDC’s COVID-19 test standards for the PCR test would pick up an excessive number of false positives. The Times report noted the CDC’s own data suggested the PCR did not detect live virus over a Ct of 33. The reporter also noted that clinicians were not receiving the Ct value as part of the test results. Yet a PCR test instruction document from the CDC that had been revised five times as of July 13, 2020, specified testing and interpretation of the test using a Ct of 40. On September 28, 2020, a study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases from Jaafar et al. had asserted, based on patient labs and clinical data involving nearly 4,000 patients, that a Ct of 30 was appropriate for making public policy. An update to the CDC instructions for PCR testing from December 1, 2020, still uses a Ct of 40. Shortly before the New York Times article was published, the CDC revised its COVID-19 test recommendations, saying that only syptomatic patients should be tested. The media went insane, and Dr. Fauci went all over television saying he was not part of the decision to change the testing standards: “I am concerned about the interpretation of these recommendations and worried it will give people the incorrect assumption that asymptomatic spread is not of great concern. In fact it is.” So, of course, the Mendacious Midget™ had spoken, and the guidelines went back to testing everyone, all the time, with an oversensitive test.  The idea that asymptomatic spread was a concern as of August was just one of many lies Dr. Fauci told. At the beginning of the pandemic in late January, he said: The one thing historically that people need to realize is that even if there is some asymptomatic transmission, in all the history of respiratory borne viruses of any type, asymptomatic transmission has never been the driver of outbreaks. The driver of outbreaks is always a symptomatic person. Even if there is a rare asymptomatic person that might transmit, an epidemic is not driven by asymptomatic carriers. There is not a single study or meta-analysis that differs from Fauci’s original assessment. Today, within an hour of Joe Biden being inaugurated and signing an executive order mandating masks on all federal property, the WHO sent out a notice to lab professionals using the PCR test. It said: WHO guidance Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 states that careful interpretation of weak positive results is needed (1). The cycle threshold (Ct) needed to detect virus is inversely proportional to the patient’s viral load. Where test results do not correspond with the clinical presentation, a new specimen should be taken and retested using the same or different NAT technology. literally one hour after Biden takes the oath, the WHO admits that PCR testing at high amplification rates alters the predictive value of the tests and results in a huge number of false positives pic.twitter.com/iDtXmappRw — Andy Swan (@AndySwan) January 20, 2021 This translates to “in the absence of symptoms, a high Ct value means you are highly unlikely to become ill or get anyone else sick in the absence of very recent exposure to an infected person.” Dr. Fauci knew this in July when he said that tests with a Ct above 35 were likely picking up viral debris or dead virus. Even at a Ct of 35, the incidence of virus samples that could replicate is very low, according to Jaafar et al. The only state I know that requires reporting the Ct with every test is Florida, which started this policy in December. The WHO went on, stating: Most PCR assays are indicated as an aid for diagnosis, therefore, health care providers must consider any result in combination with timing of sampling, specimen type, assay specifics, clinical observations, patient history, confirmed status of any contacts, and epidemiological information. In short, a positive PCR test in the absence of symptoms means nothing at a Ct of higher than 30, according to the experts interviewed by the New York Times and according to Jaafar et al. Yet positive tests is the number CNN loves flashing on the screen. If the percentage found by the Times in August holds, there have been approximately 2.43 million actual cases to date, not 24.3 million. There is also no way to calculate the deaths from COVID-19 rather than deaths with some dead viral debris in the nostrils. What I have referred to as the “casedemic” since September will be magically solved just in time for Joe Biden to look like a hero. For doing absolutely nothing. Do not tell me there is not a politicized deep state in our health agencies. Do not ever tell me I need to listen to Dr. Anthony Fauci again. And every business owner who has been ruined because of lockdowns due to a high number of “cases” should be livid. Any parent whose child has lost a year of school should be furious.

312b0fa0,"COLUMBUS — Ohio’s latest battle over workers’ rights lasted about 36 hours.  A day after word leaked out that two bills and a proposed constitutional amendment were about to be introduced to make Ohio the 25th “right-to-work” state, Senate President Keith Faber R., Celina shot down the legislation’s chances in his chamber.  “We have an ambitious agenda focused on job creation and economic recovery, and right-to-work legislation is not on that list,” Mr. Faber said. “After discussions with other leaders and my caucus, I don’t believe there is current support for this issue in the General Assembly.  “The only purpose this discussion serves right now is to generate a bunch of breathless fund-raising appeals from the Ohio Democratic Party.”  The bills would prohibit employees who refuse to join a workplace bargaining unit from being forced to pay fees in lieu of union dues. Their backers took issue with comparisons with the contentious fight over Senate Bill 5 that ended in an embarrassing defeat for Republicans in 2011.  “Senate Bill 5 was about collective bargaining and putting sort of guardrails around collective bargaining … ,” Rep. Kristina Roegner R., Hudson said. “This is quite the opposite of that. This is saying, ‘Workers, you have the freedom to join a union, to pay to be represented by them, or not.’ ”  The fight over Senate Bill 5 in 2011 filled the Statehouse and its lawn with protesters and placed Ohio in the national spotlight right up to the point when voters soundly rejected the law at the ballot box that November.  The “fair-share fee” issue was one of numerous provisions that had been tacked onto Senate Bill 5 and ultimately never went into effect.  Tom Enright, a Walbridge construction electrician and treasurer of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 8 in Toledo, was among about 50 protesters chanting “O-H-I-O, right-to-work has got to go!” outside the Statehouse on Wednesday.  “It takes away your rights as a union member. There’s no freedom here,’’ Mr. Enright said. “Right now if someone doesn’t want to pay union dues, they might have that right. They can pay for the services they use from that union.  “All right-to-work says is the union has got to represent you, and you don’t have to pay anything. They’re getting something for free. That’s not right, and it’s not fair to everyone else.”  Gov. John Kasich’s dismal poll numbers immediately after Senate Bill 5’s rebuke at the polls have since recovered, so Democrats have been eager to tie him to what they characterize as a new round of anti-worker legislation going into his 2014 re-election campaign.  In a fund-raising email, Ed FitzGerald, Cuyahoga County executive and the only announced Democratic candidate for governor next year, characterized the lawmakers behind the bills as “Governor Kasich’s Statehouse friends.”  Mr. Kasich has not embraced either proposal and has attempted to distance himself from the issue in general, even as neighboring Michigan and Indiana became right-to-work states and a separate petition effort was launched in Ohio to put the question directly to voters.  Ms. Roegner stressed that the new proposals did not come from the governor’s office. The two bills would have required the governor’s signature to become law. The joint resolution putting the question on the ballot would not.  Both sides cite statistics while supporting their arguments. Opponents claim that right-to-work states have seen wages decline, while supporters argue that new and expanding industries prefer “workplace freedom” states.  In recent years, however, Ohio’s economy has generally recovered at a faster pace than the nation as a whole. Ms. Roegner and co-sponsor Rep. Ron Maag R., Lebanon, however, argued that Ohio would probably have fared better as a workplace freedom state.  “Another thing we need to look at is our neighbor to the north and our neighbor to the west that have now both become right-to-work states,” Mr. Maag said. “Over time, I’m sure, if we look the data, that they will be taking jobs from Ohio.  “We’re doing a great job now, but we’re going to continue to make Ohio the place where workers and employers want to be.”  ",Ohio Senate tables proposed right-to-work bills,mixture,
6012c7ac,"The Food and Drug Administration FDA declared teen e-cigarette use an epidemic today, threatening to slap manufacturers including Juul with crushing fines if they don't present plans to curb sales to minors.  As of 2017, more than two million high school-age Americans used e-cigarettes, a trend that represents a historic uptake of nicotine products, the FDA said.  Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said that he believes flavored vape liquids target teenagers specifically and his agency is considering banning them altogether.  The FDA has given five companies - Vuse, Blu, JuuL, MarkTen XL, and Logic- 60 days to come up with a plan to keep teenagers from using its devices and sent warning letters to 1,300 companies that it caught selling the device to minors.  The FDA is threatening Juul an other e-cigarette makers with crippling fines if they don't come up with plans to curb sales to minors in an announcement calling teenage vaping an 'epidemic'  While e-cigarettes were first marketed to help adults quit smoking combustible cigarettes, they have now become a gateway to nicotine for teenagers.  The Juul in particular resembles a USB drive, making it easy for teenagers to hide and even bring to school.  Since the surge in teen use of the products began, the FDA and Juul have battled over the products consistently.  Now, Gottlieb is coordinating the largest scale initiative to enforce regulations against selling e-cigarettes to-date.  'We see clear signs that youth use of electronic cigarettes has reached an epidemic proportion,' he said in today's announcement.  Gottlieb reiterated his belief that certain e-cigarette liquid flavors - including sweet ones such as mango and cucumber, popular among teenage Juul users - are particularly enticing and even marketed directly to children.  Budding research on e-cigarettes also suggests that these flavors contain terpenes that may be more damaging to the lungs than other flavors are.  Other studies have indicated that while e-cigarettes may have milder effects on the lungs, they are just as bad - if not worse - for the cardiovascular system, raising risks of heart disease and high blood pressure.  What's more, e-cigarette liquids like Juul pods contain high concentrations of nicotine.  The company recently released new pods that are three percent nicotine, as opposed to the original, potent five percent ones, but in many places these have yet to hit shelves.  These levels of nicotine are highly addictive, particularly to the developing brains of children and teenagers.  Gottlieb noted that the FDA continues to support the availability of products to help adult smokers quit, but 'that work can’t come at the expense of kids,' he said.  Studies published in the last couple of years have suggested that e-cigarettes may in fact act like a gateway to nicotine and other drugs for adolescents, and Gottlieb and the FDA intend to shut those gates, by force, if necessary.  The agency is now demanding plans to reign in youth-targeted marketing campaigns and control illegal sales of their products to minors from Juul and four other e-cigarette makers within 60 days.  'We won’t allow the current trends in youth access and use to continue, even if it means putting limits in place that reduce adult uptake of these products,' Gottlieb said.","Teen vaping is an 'epidemic,' FDA declares - blaming Juuls for fueling teen addiction crisis",mixture,
7842996d,"Despite the backing of Mayor Lee Leffingwell and many of the city’s power brokers, Austin’s $1 billion transportation bond proposal, Proposition 1, went down to defeat Tuesday night. Opponents say it was the wrong plan in the wrong place, but those pushing for the mass transit system say it might have been Austin’s last chance at rail for a decade or more.  It was a crushing defeat for Austin’s only proposition on the ballot, which was voted down by about a 14 percent margin.  Citizens Against Rail Taxes founder Jim Skaggs told the Austin Monitor that he was elated.  “I think it’s a win, win, win. It’s a win for the taxpayers, it’s a win for transportation, and it’s a win for a system of transparency,” said Skaggs. “This entire plan was put together without any transparency, and what we need is a total mobility plan which is shared by the community and that is the only way to address the problems we have.”  He continued: “This rail was a huge cost for all taxpayers, the biggest taxpayer increase in history, on a community already burdened by the fastest growing tax increases of any major city in the nation … It was a huge portion of our funds for a minuscule portion of our needs. More than anything else, this thing proves that we need cost effective solutions for mobility, and those cost effective solutions have to address mobility for everybody, not for a minuscule few paid for and subsidized by all the rest.”  Let’s Go Austin campaign manager Lynda Rife was not elated.  “We’re disappointed. We worked really hard. We thought we had a good balance of roads and rail on the ballot. We thought we picked a route that would bring in the federal dollars, but the voters said, ‘No’,” said Rife.  Skaggs and Rife also had different hopes for the future, though both hoped to see Austin’s traffic problems addressed.  Skaggs said he’d like to see other, more transparent, transportation options considered by city planners in the future.  “I’d like to see two things,” said Skaggs “One, recognize that 99 percent of every trip is made on the roadways, be it private or public transit or shared or emergency or school or government vehicles, it’s on roads. And we need to fix our road system to accommodate that transportation. Second, we need to upgrade our transit system to support those people who need transit in their daily lives and have no alternative. And we need to stop trying to get people out of their cars to ride trains and other transit modes which are not viable for the 99.5 percent of the travelers.”  When asked whether she had plans for the future, Rife said, “110 people will move here tomorrow, and the next day and the next day. I’m hoping that someone is thinking about some kind of solutions.”  Rife hoped that transportation issues can be fixed, saying, “I think it’s choking our city, it’s a nightmare, and I’m worried about Austin. I’m hoping that the people who said that this wasn’t the right plan find a plan that they can support and we can all support.”  The pitch for an urban rail line was hotly debated on a number of fronts. Pro-rail supporters pointed to congestion and economic viability as reasons to support the line. They further argued that the passage of $600 million in city bond funds would leverage a matching $600 million from the federal government for the project. And they noted that a $400 million promise — seen in some quarters as a blatant pitch for support from the road warrior faction of the mobility infrastructure debate — attached to the rail bonds would ensure that necessary road work wouldn’t be left behind.  To make their case, supporters formed a political action committee, Let’s Go Austin, to fund outreach. As of that organization’s eight-day-out report, it had spent roughly $700,000. The money funded television ads, direct mail efforts and more.  Opponents of the project argued from two main camps: One, that the route and data behind the route selection were flawed, and another that fought the idea based on the prospective 6 cent per $100 of assessed property valuation tax increase.  Route opponents, loosely clumped as the Our Rail initiative, argued that the selected route — one that would extend from Highland Mall south through the University of Texas campus and downtown, across Lady Bird Lake and then east out East Riverside Drive — was not the right choice. They argued for a track that would instead run along the Lamar-Guadelupe corridor.  Meanwhile, advocates with the group AURA pushed hard against data delivered by city consultants as the project evaluation proceedings continued. Both Our Rail and AURA remained extremely vocal about their various stances via social media and at city meetings called to discuss the project.  Citizens Against Rail Taxes, or CART, followed more traditional lines in arguing that the route would be too expensive for taxpayers and relatively ineffective.  Three groups spent money arguing against the rail bond: As of the eight-day-out reports, CART had raised more than $114,000 and spent nearly $272,000. DeRail Austin raised $12,000 for that period and had spent $53,034. Our Rail spent $4,806.  This year’s result is the third time since 2000 that Austin Council members have gone to the polls for a vote on a rail project. The 2000 vote — on a fairly comprehensive rail system — came up just short. Then, in 2004, voters approved funds to construct the Capital MetroRail Red Line.

34eec9be,"By Rep. Matt Wand Lately, former state Rep. Brent Barton has taken to these pages to call for the elimination of tax ""kicker"" refunds to Oregonians. Eliminate the kicker refund, Barton writes, and the state's finances will stabilize and we'll earn a much-coveted ""AAA"" from bond rating agencies. Repealing the kicker may impress some Wall Street bankers, but it'll do little to stabilize state finances and absolutely nothing to improve our economy and put people back to work. Oregon voters placed the kicker in the Oregon Constitution as a reaction to Salem's spending habits. Their suspicions are well-founded. Every time the Legislature ""suspended"" the kicker, most recently the corporate kicker in 2007, Salem spent every penny and failed to stabilize the state's revenues. We have no reason to believe this time it will be any different. During Barton's single term in the Oregon House, the 2009 Legislature raised taxes by $1.6 billion while increasing overall state spending by 18 percent, all during a historic recession. This kind of spending, with or without the kicker, is not a good recipe for fiscal stability. Rather than eliminating the kicker, a better solution is to require the Legislature to set aside 1 percent of general fund revenue for a rainy day fund every biennium. The plan is simple because it forces state government to save money before it spends it all. Rather than waiting years for the kicker to kick in, this proposal would provide consistent savings to protect vital services during an emergency. To earn an AAA rating, Oregon needs an AAA economy. Rather than extracting more revenue, government should create an environment in which businesses can succeed and hire. We should also provide tax relief to families and low-income Oregonians. Last session, I supported legislation that would have provided a $500 child tax credit and would have adjusted the personal income tax brackets to reduce the burden on those who are suffering during this economic downturn. When Oregonians have more money in their pockets, they will spend it at local businesses, help create jobs and generate more tax revenues for state and local governments. With more money in the economy, nonpartisan analysts in Salem have estimated this legislation would have created over 19,000 jobs. Unfortunately, it has been challenging to pass measures to encourage businesses to hire unemployed workers, to reduce excessive regulations on businesses seeking to locate and expand in Oregon, and to provide tax relief to families and low-income Oregonians. The Legislature should reconsider these solutions when it reconvenes in February. Barton's argument for eliminating the kicker ignores the fact that Oregon is still mired in a deep economic downturn. Raising taxes will not create more jobs, and over the long term will not bring long-term stability that Barton and others are promising. As long as Oregon's economy continues to struggle, an AAA rating alone won't solve our problems. We need an AAA economy, with a consistent savings plan and a healthy business environment to secure Oregon's long-term stability and prosperity. Rep.

As you know, a few days ago, after a rigorous opening — open and objective scientific review process, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. We should all be encouraged by this news of a third safe and highly effective COVID-19 vaccine. The more people who get vaccinated, the faster we’re going to overcome this virus and get back to our loved ones, get our economy back on track, and start to move back to normal.  But that’s — one of my first goals in office was — when I got into office was to say that there will be 100 million vaccination shots administered in my first 100 days in office. We’ve got halfway to that goal in 37 days, and I feel confident we’ll make it all the way.  As I — and as I’ve said, we have a long way to go, but, you know, as I said from the outset, we’re going to use every resource of the federal government to make it happen. Among the things I learned when I came into office was that Johnson & Johnson was behind in manufacturing and production. While we pote- — while we had the potential of another highly effective vaccine to accompany the two existing vaccines, it simply wasn’t coming fast enough. So my team — my team has been hard at work to accelerate that effort.  As I’ve always said, this was a wartime effort, and every action has been on the table, including putting together breakthrough approaches.  And today, we’re announcing a major step forward: Two of the largest healthcare and pharmaceutical companies in the world — that are usually competitors — are working together on the vaccine. Johnson & Johnson and Merck will work together to expand the production of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine. This is the type of collaboration between companies we saw in World War Two.  We also invoked the Defense Production Act to equip two Merck facilities to the standards necessary to safely manufacture the J&J vaccine. And with the urging and assistance of my administration, Johnson & Johnson is also taking additional new actions to safely accelerate vaccine production. Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine manufacturing facilities will now begin to operate 24/7.  In addition, we’ll continue to use the Defense Production Act to expedite critical materials in vaccine production, such as equipment, machinery, and supplies.  I’ve also asked the Department of Defense to provide daily logistical support to strengthen Johnson & Johnson’s efforts. And I want to thank Johnson & Johnson and Merck for stepping up and being good corporate citizens during this national crisis.  Here’s what all this means: We’re now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May.  Let me say that again: When I came into office, the prior administration had contracted for not nearly enough vaccine to cover adults in America. We rectified that. About three weeks ago, we were able to say that we’ll have enough vaccine supply for adults by the end of July.  And I’m pleased to announce today, as a consequence of the stepped-up process that I’ve ordered and just outlined, this country will have enough vaccine supply — I’ll say it again — for every adult in America by the end of May. By the end of May. That’s progress — important progress.  But it’s not enough to have the vaccine supply. We need vaccinators — people to put the shots in people’s arms, millions of Americans’ arms.  To date, we’ve brought back retired doctors and nurses. We’ve developed — we deployed more than 1,500 federal medical personnel you usually see during natural disasters, from the Federal Emergency Management Agency — FEMA — and the Commissioned Health Corps at the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Defense Department, including the National Guard, with thousands of more to come.  We’re also increasing the places where people can get vaccinated. We’ve sent millions of vaccines to over 7,000 pharmacies to make it easier for folks to get their COVID-19 vaccine shot like they would their flu shot.  The federal government is also working with states to set up hundreds of mass vaccination centers in places like stadiums, community centers, parking lots that vaccinate thousands of people per day. My wife Jill and I just visited one in Houston last week. It’s incredible.  And with this increased production of three safe and effective vaccines, we have an opportunity to help address the urgent national need more quickly and getting our schools back open safely.  Right now, an entire generation of young people is on the brink of being set back a year or more in their learning. You can ask millions of parents; they understand. We’re already seeing rising mental health concerns due in part to isolation.  Educational disparities that have always existed grow wider each day that our schools remain closed. And remote learning isn’t the same for every student, as you all know.  Our educators are doing everything they can to protect and educate our students, despite the lack of resources and as districts face budget crises that risk education jobs.  Moms and dads are exiting the workforce in astonishing numbers in order to care for and manage the school experience for their children at home, hindering their own opportunities for — and further undermining the health of our economy.  This is a national imperative that we get our kids back into the classroom safely and as soon as possible. As you know, back in December, I set a goal of having a majority of our K-through-8 schools open by the end of my first 100 days as President.  To achieve that goal, I sent the American Rescue Plan to Congress to provide vital help to make sure schools can open safely — reopen safely. Essential things like more teachers to reduce class sizes, more buses and bus drivers to transport our kids safely, and more space to conduct in-person instructions, and more protective equipment, school cleaning services, physical alterations to reduce the risk of the spread of the virus. All cost money. The House passed the American Rescue Plan last week, and I hope the Senate will follow as quickly and as well.  You know, also, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, issued new guidelines on how to reopen schools safely. It’s a roadmap that will enable schools — if they have the resources they deserve — to reopen safely. I have given those schools a roadmap. I’ve asked Congress to give them the tools. And today, to add one more tool to school reopening: a vaccinated workforce.  Let me be clear: We can reopen schools if the right steps are taken, even before employees are vaccinated. But time and again, we’ve heard from educators and parents that they have anxieties about that.  So as yet another move to help accelerate the safe reopening of our schools, let’s treat in-person learning like an essential service that it is. And that means getting essential workers who provide that service — educators, school staff, childcare workers — get them vaccinated immediately. They’re essential workers.  Over 30 states have already taken step to prior- –prioritize educators for vaccination. And today, I’m using the full authority of the federal government. I’m directing every state to do the same. My challenge to all states, territories, and the District of Columbia is this: We want every educator, school staff member, childcare worker to receive at least one shot by the end of the month of March.  To help make this happen, starting next week and for a month — the month of March, we will be using our federal pharmacy program to prioritize the vaccination of pre-K through 12 educators and staff and child-care workers. Throughout March, they will be able to prioritize the vaccination of pre-K-through-12 educators and staff and childcare workers. Throughout March, they will be able to sign up for an appointment at a pharmacy near them.  And I want to be very clear: Not every educator will be able to get their appointment in the first week, but our goarl [sic] — goal is to do everything we can to help every educator receive a shot this month, the month of March.  I want to conclude with this: We’re making progress from the mess we inherited. We’re moving in the right direction. And today’s announcements are a huge step in our effort to beat this pandemic. But I have to be honest with you: This fight is far from over. I told you I’d be straight up with you from the beginning. As I said many times, things may get worse again as new variants spread and as we face setbacks, like recent winter storms in the Midwest and South. But our administration will never take this public health threat lightly.  Though we celebrate the news of the third vaccine, I urge all Americans: Please keep washing your hands, stay socially distanced, wear masks — keep wearing them, get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Now is not the time to let up. I’ve asked the country to wear masks for my first 100 days in office. Now is not the time to let our guard down. People’s lives are at stake.  We have already — we have already — and I carry this in my pocket — lost more — as of today, we’ve lost more than 511,839 Americans, as of today. It’s got to stop.  We need the United States Senate to follow the House and pass the American Rescue Plan, because despite the optimism, without new resources, our entire effort will be set back. We need the resources in the American Rescue Plan and we need it urgently. We need them expanding testing, ramp up vaccine distribution, fund FEMA and other federal vaccine efforts, and continue reimbursing states for their efforts.  We need the resources to expand genomic sequencing; to stay ahead of emerging variants; find the protective gear, transportation, staffing, and other costs required for school and business to open safely. We need to fund it. The bottom line is: We need the American Rescue Plan now. Now.  There is light at the end of the tunnel, but we cannot let our guard down now or assure that victory is inevitable. We can’t assume that. We must remain vigilant, act fast and aggressively, and look out for one another. That’s how we’re going to get ahead of this virus, get our economy going again, and get back to our loved ones.  So thank you. And please, please, it’s not over yet. Great news, but stay vigilant. May God bless you, and may God protect our troops. Thank you all very, very much.  Q Mr. President, based on the news you announced, when do you think things will get back to normal? When do you think things will get back to normal?  THE PRESIDENT: When do I think things will get back to normal? I’ve been cautioned not to give an answer to that because we don’t know for sure. But my hope is, by this time next year, we’re going to be back to normal, and before that — my hope. But again, it depends upon if people continue — continue to be smart and understand that we still can have significant losses. There’s a lot we have to do yet. So thank you.  Q Did you receive a briefing about the border today?  THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I did.  Q What did you learn?  THE PRESIDENT: A lot.  Q Is there a crisis at the border, sir?  THE PRESIDENT: No, we’ll be able to handle it, God willing.  4:34 P.M. EST",Remarks by President Biden on the Administration’s COVID-19 Vaccination Efforts,mixture,
c70fd1b6,"Science once again catching up with what many already knew – but this is progress: A new scientific study has investigated the toxicity of various drugs and found Marijuana the clear winner. It’s been found significantly less toxic than all the other substances on the list – including not only illegal drugs but the LEGAL alcohol and tobacco. Here’s our full report.  Claims on marijuana’s medicinal values have been widely debated despite support from medical research and study. Federal legislations that govern marijuana use aim to restrict rather than regulate – and this has posed a problem to people seeking the medicinal and recreational effects of the herb, very far from intentions of abusing its effects. What is it about marijuana that scares the government – and the public – so much?  Marijuana Use in the United States  Marijuana, colloquially referred to as weed or pot, is made up of dried leaves and flowers of the hemp plant Cannabis sativa. Statistics released by the National Institute of Drug Abuse reveal that in respondents aged 18 to 25, more than half exactly 51.90 percent have used marijuana. Percentages are lower in the other two age groups, with 16.40 percent of respondents aged 12 to 17 and 45.70 percent of respondents aged 26 and older reporting marijuana use. [1]  Laws in more than half the number of states in the US prohibit marijuana use, whether recreationally or medically. Currently 2015, only 21 states plus the District of Columbia have passed medical marijuana laws MMLs that recognize and permit the medicinal use of the herb. [2]  Numerous studies have reported the positive medicinal effects of marijuana on pain, sleep, and overall comfort. A survey conducted by Trip, et. al. 2014 revealed that marijuana use was effective in improving mood, pain, muscle spasms, and sleep quality in patient with prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome. [3] The data collected from a more recent study in 2015 by Degenhardt, et. al. revealed that marijuana use in conjunction with prescribed opioids were able to induce effective pain relief in respondents experiencing chronic non-cancer pain. [4] These studies further support the popularity of marijuana use among people experiencing acute and chronic pain.  On the other hand, there have also been studies on the adverse effects of marijuana. One of these was published in mid-2014, focusing the negative health effects of smoking marijuana, particularly on the increased risk for lung cancer. [5] Of course, the study was only able to reveal how it was smoke not cannabis itself that damages lung tissue. This problem could easily be solved by changing the method in which marijuana is administered.  Risk Assessment of Marijuana and Other Substances  But is marijuana use as dangerous as the law makes it out to be? The intoxicating effects of marijuana, although different, are not thought more severe than that of mild to moderate alcohol intake – a substance that is not illegal anywhere in the United States, or most countries all over the world. A study published in January 2015 by Lechenmeier and Rehm [6] assessed the comparative risk between different “mind-altering” substances, specifically alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and other illicit drugs like heroin. Surprisingly, the study revealed that cannabis was the least risky substance, belonging to the other end of the spectrum. Do you know what substance was revealed the most risky? Alcohol.  How is this possible? The study used an approach called the Margin of Exposure MOE which is drastically different from other studies that simply attempted to find causational relationship between two factors – 1 substance use/abuse and 2 mortality. MOE is different; it’s a ratio between the estimated average human intake and the benchmark dose or toxicological threshold. Basically, it’s a ratio between how much humans typically intake and the dose at which the substance becomes dangerous – which is a better judge of how risky a substance can be. The higher the MOE is, the higher its spot on the list.  The results of the study were conclusive: The highest spot belonged to alcohol, while the succeeding spots were filled by heroin, cocaine, nicotine, MDMA, methamphetamine, methadone, amphetamine, diazepam, and THC or marijuana. With marijuana in the lowest spot over 100 times less toxic than alcohol, it can be surmised that its effects on health and society have been largely overestimated. If there was a plant that couldn’t be more misunderstood – or was it perhaps intentionally maligned – it has to be marijuana.  It’s important to note that the study measured toxic effects and does not consider any social effects of the use of the drug. However, this result is a clear indication that policies on marijuana are outdated and need re-evaluation – which is something that is gradually happening. It’s good news for the herband for the use of herbs in general.  References:  [1] National Institute of Drug Abuse 2014. Marijuana.

0f086930,"CONTACT: Bryan Kennedy, 414 517-3864  Milwaukee — Wisconsin gubernatorial candidate Matt Flynn today made the following statement criticizing Scott Walker for his failed economic policies, as Walker prepares to announce his campaign for re-election tomorrow.  “Scott Walker’s time is up. Average wages, when adjusted for inflation, are lower today than they were under Jim Doyle. For the first time in decades, Wisconsin has fallen behind the rest of the country in terms of economic growth.  “Walker depressed Wisconsin wages by passing Act 10, Right To Work, and the repeal of the prevailing wage. Everybody is working for less, union or non-union, public sector or private sector. Less money in workers’ pockets means less consumer spending, and less economic growth.  “Walker also refused to accept the very tax dollars Wisconsinites sent to the federal government, including upwards of $500 million for BadgerCare and over $800 million for trains. Instead, he is making taxpayers invest $3 billion in a Chinese company, said they didn’t need to follow the same environmental laws Miller Brewing and Harley Davidson follow, and is pushing it through his corrupt Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation without the public ever seeing the contract.  “When Walker says Wisconsin is ‘open for business’ it means his integrity and campaign coffers are open for business. And while it’s been very good for his fundraising operations, his record has been a nonstop disaster for Wisconsin families. For the right-wing views of his party, he has sacrificed our state.  “The most important issue in this race is improving wages for Wisconsin workers. Scott Walker has been governor for nearly eight years now, and he’s looking to extend it to twelve. We all know he’s just sitting there as he makes plans for his own future. Instead, it’s time to elect a governor who will focus on what really matters, creating economic activity that drives wages up again.”",Flynn campaign: Statement on Walker campaign announcement,mixture,
2d038c58,"Scientist Peter Wadhams believes the summer ice cover at the north pole is about to disappear, triggering even more rapid global warming. Scientist Peter Wadhams believes the summer ice cover at the north pole is about to disappear, triggering even more rapid global warming. Peter Wadhams has spent his career in the Arctic, making more than 50 trips there, some in submarines under the polar ice. He is credited with being one of the first scientists to show that the thick icecap that once covered the Arctic ocean was beginning to thin and shrink. He was director of the Scott Polar Institute in Cambridge from 1987 to 1992 and professor of ocean physics at Cambridge since 2001. His book, A Farewell to Ice, tells the story of his unravelling of this alarming trend and describes what the consequences for our planet will be if Arctic ice continues to disappear at its current rate. You have said on several occasions that summer Arctic sea ice would disappear by the middle of this decade. It hasn’t. Are you being alarmist?
No. There is a clear trend down to zero for summer cover. However, each year chance events can give a boost to ice cover or take some away. The overall trend is a very strong downward one, however. Most people expect this year will see a record low in the Arctic’s summer sea-ice cover. Next year or the year after that, I think it will be free of ice in summer and by that I mean the central Arctic will be ice-free. You will be able to cross over the north pole by ship. There will still be about a million square kilometres of ice in the Arctic in summer but it will be packed into various nooks and crannies along the Northwest Passage and along bits of the Canadian coastline. Ice-free means the central basin of the Arctic will be ice-free and I think that that is going to happen in summer 2017 or 2018. Why should we be concerned about an Arctic that is free of ice in summer? People tend to think of an ice-free Arctic in summer in terms of it merely being a symbol of global change. Things happen, they say. In fact, the impact will be profound and will effect the whole planet and its population. One key effect will be albedo feedback. Sea ice reflects about 50% of the solar radiation it receives back into space. By contrast, water reflects less than 10%. So if you replace ice with water, which is darker, much more solar heat will be absorbed by the ocean and the planet will heat up even more rapidly than it is doing at present. Sea ice also acts as an air-conditioning system. Winds coming over the sea to land masses such as Siberia and Greenland will no longer be cooled as they pass over ice and these places will be heated even further. These effects could add 50% to the impact of global warming that is produced by rising carbon emissions. In the end, the only hope we have is to find a way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere once it has got there. What will be the effects of this accelerating increase in temperatures? The air over Greenland will get warmer and more and more of its ice will melt. It is already losing about 300 cubic kilometres of ice a year. Antarctica is adding to the melt as well. Sea-level rises will accelerate as a result. The most recent prediction of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is that seas will rise by 60 to 90 centimetres this century. I think a rise of one to two metres is far more likely. Indeed, it is probably the best we can hope for. That may not sound a lot but it is really very serious. It will increase enormously the frequency of storm surges all over the world. We may be able to raise the Thames barrier in Britain but in Bangladesh, it just means more and more people will be drowned. Global warming is generally associated with increased fossil-fuel burning and consequent rises in levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. But is that the only climate problem we face?
No it is not. We also have the issue of methane. Russian scientists who have investigated waters off their coast have detected more and more plumes of methane bubbling up from the seabed. The reason this is happening is closely connected with the warming of the planet and the shrinking of the Arctic icecaps. Until around 2005, even in summer, you still had sea ice near the coast. Then it started to disappear, so that for three or four months a year warm water reached the shallow waters around the shores where there had been permafrost ground since the last ice age. It has started to melt with dangerous consequences. Underneath the permafrost there are sediments full of methane hydrates. When the permafrost goes, you release the pressure on top of these hydrates and the methane comes out of solution. Can we monitor this methane just as we can monitor carbon dioxide? Yes, we can measure methane over large areas using satellites. These have shown that methane levels that had been fairly flat for most of the last century have started to rise and are accelerating, often with little outliers on the graph. There is a scientist called Jason Box who works in Denmark for the Greenland Survey and he calls these outliers dragon’s breath. They are not some sort of measurement caused by dodgy instruments. They are real pulses of methane coming from offshore flumes.

An image from the NOAA/Nasa Suomi NPP satellite taken on May 30, 2016, highlights the Arctic ice retreat off the north-west coast of Alaska. The average Arctic sea ice extent for May 2016 set a new record low since satellite observations began. Photograph: Suomi NPP/NASA/NOAA How intense is methane as a heater of the atmosphere compared with carbon dioxide? It is 23 times more powerful. However, methane dissipates much more quickly than carbon dioxide. It gets oxidised so that it only lingers in the atmosphere for about seven or eight years. By contrast, carbon dioxide hangs around in the climate system for about 100 years before it ends up in the sea and is absorbed by creatures that die and litter the seabed. At least that is what scientists thought. Today, there are quite a number of researchers who think carbon dioxide could last 1,000 years in the atmosphere. So in the long run carbon dioxide is still going to be worse than methane in terms of heating the planet because a single methane pulse will have a disastrous effect but if there is nothing to follow it on then it will go away. But with carbon dioxide there is a ratchet effect. All the carbon dioxide we release by burning fossil fuels just builds up in the atmosphere. We are having to live with last century’s carbon dioxide. What that says is simple: there is no such thing as a safe emission rate of carbon dioxide. That is why I am despondent about us ever being able to cut carbon emissions. If we cannot halt the emissions of carbon dioxide, what can we do? In the end, the only hope we have is to find a way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere once it has got there. Even the IPCC has admitted that we will have to find a way to extract carbon dioxide from the air. The trouble is that they don’t just how we can do that. The most favoured scheme is known as BECCS: bio-energy with carbon capture and storage. Essentially, you plant trees and bushes over vast swaths of ground. These grow, absorbing carbon dioxide in the process. Then you burn the wood to run power plants while trapping, liquefying and storing the carbon dioxide that is released. It sounds straightforward. Will it work? I am a bit suspicious of this technology. BECCS will need so much land to be effective. Calculations suggest it would need 40% to 50% of the arable land of the planet to make it work on the scale we will need and that would not leave enough land to grow crops to feed the world or to provide homes for a viable population of wild animals and plants. Other techniques, such as crushing and spreading olivine rocks, which absorb carbon dioxide, on beaches, will simply not scale up. They won’t work, so we will have to find some other way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere directly. As far as I can see, it will have to take the form of some sort of device into which you pump air at one end and you get air without carbon dioxide coming out the other end. It can be done, I am sure, but at the moment we do not have such a device. However, without something like that I cannot see how we are going to deal with the carbon dioxide that is getting into the atmosphere. We are going to have to rely on a technology that has not yet been developed. That is a measure of the troubles that lie ahead for us. I think humanity can do it, but I would feel much better if I saw governments investing in such technology.

,"Federal lawmaker Shina Peller has stated that the next president of Nigeria should not be chosen based on personality cult or subjective feelings.  Reacting to a question on whether former Lagos governor, Bola Tinubu should be president of Nigeria in 2023, Mr Peller says that the president’s office should be based on strong institution rather than individuals. He said criteria should be set, leaving whoever meets the criteria to occupy the office.  “We need to build an institution now, we do not need to take any single person and be saying we want to now rally around that person. I think let us form an institution, let us identify a criteria and let us see who meets up with the criteria.  “There is no institution that has set up the criteria yet, if the criteria says the next president should be christian, is Asiwaju a christian?,” Mr Peller told Sam Olatunji in an interview.  Mr Peller, like Mr Tinubu, is a member of the ruling All Progressives Congress.  The House of Representatives member further stated that relying on personalities to save Nigeria was a mistake, and that the next president should be elected through institutions capable of ensuring the competency of the individuals.  “We have made the mistake two times. There was a time in Nigeria when President Obasanjo was brought from prison and everybody was saying he is the best person that could do this and we started to run around him. The Same thing happened to President Buhari, everybody was saying Mohammadu Buhari is a saint, he is not corrupt and then everyone starts to run around him, I believe this must stop,” Mr Peller said.  Mr Tinubu returned from London Friday evening after spending three months undergoing surgery and a follow up therapy on his knee.    A statement by his media office said the former Lagos governor was back and ready to contribute his quota to developing the country’s democracy and economy.

The Labour leader joined Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, SNP MPs, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron and ex-Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg to back the motion on its first day in Parliament.  So far 28 MPs have signed the motion, drawn up by the Lib Dems, to stop legal changes to disability benefit Personal Independence Payment PIP.  Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Debbie Abrahams, who has reported the PIP shake-up to the United Nations, has also signed the motion against the law.  Ministers drew up emergency laws to combat two tribunals which said PIP - which funds disabled people's living costs - should be widened.  The tribunals said people who suffer overwhelming psychological distress when they leave home should get more cash.  That includes those with autism, dementia, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress and depression.  Tory MP Heidi Allen warned ministers have a duty to honour the tribunals and the Bow Group, a Tory think tank, said ignoring them gives the Conservative Party a bad name.  Yet the government refused to back down - saying to do so would cost taxpayers £3.7bn by 2022.  And Tory MP Mr Freeman sparked outrage by claiming the bizarre judgements had simply helped people who take pills at home who suffer from anxiety.  Despite the support for the motion it faces a struggle to be accepted - and the last time a similar one succeeded was in 1979.  The legal shake-up is happening via a Statutory Instrument subject to negative resolution, an obscure piece of law that can only be blocked if MPs pray against it.  The law came into effect instantly on February 23, but under Westminster's bizarre system, can be annulled if the House of Commons votes to back a prayer within 40 days and nights.  Labour and the Lib Dems both submitted a formal prayer to Commons authorities today, and the Lib Dems' - which arrived first - was selected for debate.  Being signed by the Leader of the Opposition makes a prayer more likely to be considered for debate.  But they are still not always guaranteed time in the Commons, even if there is widespread support for them.","Jeremy Corbyn signs bid to kill off law denying increased disability benefits to 150,000 people",mixture,

WALLACE: We’ll discuss the impact on the environment, the U.S. economy and America's place in the world with Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency.  And critics attack President Trump for leaving the climate deal, pointing to long-lasting consequences.  EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT: Make our planet great again.  REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALI., MINORITY LEADER: How was he ever going to explain to his grandchildren what he did to the air they breathe?  WALLACE: We’ll talk with one of the world's leading advocate on climate change, former Vice President Al Gore, who calls the president's withdrawal reckless and indefensible.  Pruitt and Al Gore, live, only on Fox News Sunday.  Plus, former FBI Director James Comey testifies before Congress this week about his conversations with Mr. Trump. We’ll ask our Sunday panel about what promises to be a moment of high drama.  All, right now, on Fox News Sunday.  END VIDEOTAPE  WALLACE: And hello again from Fox News in Washington.  We begin with breaking news out of London, at least seven are dead and dozens injured after another terror attack targeted Britain's capital. This comes less than two weeks after a suicide bomber hit a pop concert in Manchester, England.  In a few minutes, we’ll talk with Senator Roy Blunt, member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.  But we begin with Fox team coverage, Catherine Herridge on what the intelligence community is saying. But, first, senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot live from our London bureau -- Greg.  GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Chris, for the third time in three months, terror hits the U.K. and once again, it is ugly. It was on a busy Saturday night in London as the attackers spread across London Bridge in a rented van, driving up on the walkway, smashing into pedestrians. They then ditched that vehicle a few blocks away, and armed with long knives stabbed their way through bars and restaurants nearby, with some putting up a fight.  All told, at least seven people were killed, 48 injured, many critically, including an off-duty police officer. Along with British citizens from France, Australia and elsewhere were targeted. No word yet on whether any Americans were involved.  Now, police caught up with the attackers just eight minutes later, shooting that all three, at least one had a beard, camouflage pants and a fake suicide vest. When one attack he reportedly screamed out: Praise to Allah -- the Arabic word for God.  Here is what U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May had to say today.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: As a country, our response must be what it has always been, when we have been confronted by violence. We must come together, we must pull together and united we will take on and defeat our enemies.  END VIDEO CLIP  PALKOT: Police now say they have arrested 12 people following raids in eastern London, said to be the home of one of the attackers. It is a sign that authorities might be on the trail of the terrorist. Police also doing a thorough forensic search of the entire terrorist site, but what is next?  Prime Minister Theresa May also said today terror breeds terror -- Chris.  WALLACE: Greg Palkot, reporting from London -- Greg, thanks for that.  Now, let's bring in chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge with the latest on who was behind the attack -- Catherine.  CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Chris, no group is claiming responsibility this morning. But within minutes of the attack, a senior ISIS affiliated social media account pushed out slick propaganda on using vehicles as weapons, threatening more violence. It's not clear whether the ISIS posts were opportunistic or the terror group played a role. This morning, U.S. and U.K. intelligence are focused on the suspects and whether they acted alone or had a terror network behind them.  British security sources reporting that very early indications suggest the attack may have been pulled together at short notice. With the rising homegrown threat, British police are trained to quickly neutralize suspects as they did last night.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  CRESSIDA DICK, LONDON METROPOLITAN POLICE COMMISSIONER: That vehicle continued to drive from London Bridge to the borough market. The suspects then left the vehicle and a number of people were stabbed. The suspects were shot dead by armed officers.  END VIDEO CLIP  HERRIDGE: Homeland Security is saying that at this time they have no information to indicate if specific credible threat to the United States. Secretary Kelly told Fox last night he worries we are, quote, right around the corner from having a similar attack but for the efforts of DHS and law enforcement agencies.  President Trump was briefed last night and spoke with the British prime minister, expressing his condolences and praising the heroic response of London police and first responders.  The president also seeming to make a political point that the attack bolstered his travel ban: We need to be smart, vigilant and tough, he tweeted. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the travel ban extra level of security -- safety.  Questions are being raised this morning about a possible intelligence failure after the British government recently lower the threat level, Chris.  WALLACE: Catherine, thank you.  HERRIDGE: You’re welcome.  WALLACE: Joining me now, Roy Blunt, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.  Senator, welcome back.  SEN. ROY BLUNT, R-MISSOURI: Good to be with you.  WALLACE: What can you add to what we just heard from Catherine Herridge?  BLUNT: Well, you know, I think what we are seeing is such a broad band of potential attacks. We hear from our own intelligence community and have for years, more threats for more directions than ever before. You see the terrible Manchester bombing, those young people, mostly young women, young girls, with a fairly sophisticated bomb, based on published reports on that.  These guys have a van and kitchen knives. We think other groups are looking at more advanced kinds of attacks. So, clearly, this is from all directions, is tends to take credit for the things that you can steal a truck, get your van, drive in a car, terrorized people with very little planning or backup. Other groups we believe are looking at other things and we are constantly have to be vigilant, I think Secretary Kelly is right when he says that only because we have been fortunate and worked hard to prevent this have we not had these kinds of attacks here.  WALLACE: I want to play a clip from British Prime Minister May today. Here it is.  BGEGIN VIDEO CLIP  MAY: While the recent attacks are not connected by common networks, they are connected in one important sense. They are bound together by the single evil ideology of Islamist extremism.  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE: Any explanation as to why we have seen three fatal terror attacks in Britain in less than three months?  BLUNT: I don't know if there's any real explanation for that, but in Paris and London and Western Europe, generally, it got people who came there to do jobs that were allowed to stay in enclaves, never became part of the society. You see the second generation of those families often turning to what the prime minister mentioned, you know, we need to say, we need to talk about it, our friends who are Muslim need to admit that this extreme sense of Islam that results in these attacks has to be called for what it is and we have to try to do what we can to intervene.  WALLACE: Do we have -- I’ve heard the argument that because we are beginning to roll back ISIS in the so-called caliphate in Iraq and Syria, that there is an increased emphasis on these attacks, these kind of low technology attacks in the West. Do you think our success in one place is creating more of a threat?  BLUNT: I think you can. You know, somebody made the observation that long ago that sometimes countries implode. Syria seems to have exploded. That as things change in Syria, people have access to Europe in ways that you would otherwise want to try and do something about.  There's no way to do background checks on people that come in from communities that no longer exist, jobs that were jobs months or years ago. And so, I think we do see that. And, you know, like so many of the things that happened in Northern Africa, what people initially thought would be the result would turn out to be just the opposite.  WALLACE: As a member of the Senate Intelligence committee, any indication of an increased terror threat here in the U.S.?  BLUNT: I think the terror threat is real. You know, one of the things -- when we've seen things like San Bernardino, more often than not, U.S. officials, the FBI and others talk to these people, after months of surveillance decided they no longer needed to be under the level of watch they were and then suddenly these kinds of things happen.  I do think, again, that you've got some groups that are looking at a big play like taking down an airliner. You've got others who need very little support, very little planning, and can do incredible damage, which is actually in many ways almost more of terrorism because you go anywhere, do anything, you wonder what could happen at any moment. It could happen here --  CROSSTALK  WALLACE: -- in London Bridge on a Saturday night.  BLUNT: London Bridge, the Westminster Bridge, the concert.  WALLACE: The concert, yes.  BLUNT: All of these things are true terror targets. They’re not -- it's not like going after the U.S. embassy.  WALLACE: Right.  BLUNT: They are true terror targets.  WALLACE: As Catherine mentioned just after the news broke about this terror attack, President Trump tweeted another call for his travel ban. That case is now before the U.S. Supreme Court. Do you think the justices should pay attention to the kind of thing that is happening in England and other parts of the world as they make that decision?  I mean, the fact is, in Britain, most of these terrorists have been homegrown. They've been U.K. citizens.  BLUNT: They have been. And, you know, looking at where people like that who come to our country have been is important. I’m not nearly as concerned as a lot of people are about the visa waiver program, because the visa waiver program just triggers that you can spend more time on people who you have reason to believe may have been in Libya, may have been in Syria, may have become radicalized.  I don’t know what the court will decide. I’m not a lawyer. I think my view is the president does have certainly the right to put in place extreme vetting. And, Christ, it’s been four -- it's been four months since I said they needed four months to put that in place. I think you can do that without a travel ban and hopefully we are.  WALLACE: I want to talk to you about another hat as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. A lot of anticipation about the testimony this week from FBI -- former FBI Director James Comey, what you expect to hear from him? What questions do you have for him?  BLUNT: Well, I think it's important that we talk to everybody who should be talk to about this. I do believe that the Senate Intelligence Committee is the most likely place to bring this investigation to conclusion with whatever the conclusion turns out to be. You know, we used to dealing with each other on issues like this, so we are used to classify documents, we’re used to coming together to protect the country. Hopefully, that's what we will be able to do --  CROSSTALK  WALLACE: What are you looking to ask ph from Comey?  BLUNT: We -- what Comey says and how he says that I think will be important. I haven't frankly understood much of what Comey has done since about a year ago. And his decisions have been, I think, highly questionable. We’ll see what -- why he was prepared for that meeting the way he was, said he had a round of murder board kind of questions before he went to see the president, why he thought it was important to immediately download that, and what other meetings he had that frankly he didn't think were so important to download what happen.  WALLACE: Finally, do you think that President Trump has a legitimate claim to executive privilege to block Comey from testifying? And as a practical matter, do you think he should invoke it?  BLUNT: I think the president is better served by getting all this information out. Sooner rather than later, let's find out what happened and bring this to a conclusion. You don't do that I think by invoking executive privilege on a conversation you had apparently with nobody else in the room. You know, most stories have two sides to them. At some point, we’ll hear the president’s side. But I frankly think we need to hear Mr. Comey's side and find out what other questions we need to ask after he answers the questions this week.  WALLACE: Senator Blunt, thank you. Thanks for your time this Sunday. And thank you for coming in on short notice.  BLUNT: Glad to be here.  WALLACE: Up next, President Trump's dramatic decision this week to pull out of the Paris climate accord. We’ll talk with EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, a key player in the president's deliberations.  COMMERCIAL BREAK  WALLACE: A look outside the beltway at Pittsburgh. The president said he's looking out for residents of the former steel town in pulling out of the Paris climate deal.  International leaders, business executives and people around the world are still reacting to President Trump's decision this week. In a few minutes, we’ll talk with former Vice President Al Gore, a leading advocate on climate change.  Joining me now is Scott Pruitt, Mr. Trump's administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency and a key player in the president's decision.  Mr. Pruitt, welcome back to Fox News Sunday.  SCOTT PRUITT, EPA ADMINISTRATOR: Good morning, Chris.  WALLACE: I want to start with a question that you were asked repeatedly on Friday. Here it is.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  MARY BRUCE, ABC NEWS: Yes or no, does the president believe that the climate change is real and a threat to the United States?  PHILIP RUCKER, WASHINGTON POST: Does the president believe today that climate change is a hoax?  PRUITT: What's interesting about all the discussions we had through the last several weeks have been focused on one singular issue: is Paris good or not for this country?  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE: Let me get this straight, you and the president spent weeks discussing whether he should pull out of the Paris climate deal and you never discussed climate change?  PRUITT: It was about the merits and demerits of the deal, Chris.  CROSSTALK  PRUITT: That’s what the focus.  Look, when you look at what this country has achieved since the late 1990s-2000 time frame, we've seen an 18 percent reduction in CO2 footprint from 2000 to 2014. We’re at pre-1994 levels.  You know, what's interesting about all this criticism from the left, environment left, is if you go back to the time when the Paris deal was cut, those same groups -- in fact, James Hansen, former national scientist, called it a fake and a fraud. The general counsel of the Sierra Club was critical of what was achieved in Paris because it didn't hold China, it did not hold India accountable, and the United States agreed to 26 percent to 28 percent reductions, in CHD ph.  CROSSTALK  WALLACE: We’re going to get into all of that, but what I’m asking you is, as the president’s EPA administrator, as his point person on the environment, isn’t that a conversation that over the last few months that you have to have, whether or not climate change is real or a hoax, as the president suggested, and whether or not human activity contributes to it? Are you saying you've never had that conversation with him?  PRUITT: The focus of the last several weeks was centered --  WALLACE: I’m asking you over the last few months --  PRUITT: -- was centered on the merits and demerits of the Paris agreement. The president said -- said actually back during the campaign, that climate change occurs. I’ve said -- I’ve said during my confirmation process that climate change is occurring. That human activity contributes to it.  WALLACE: He also said it was a hoax.  PRUITT: Well, Chris, the point here, and to your question, this is something over the last several weeks, the president has received much information about the impact on jobs and also the impact on the environment. You know, we have nothing to be apologetic about as a country with respect to what we've done in reducing our CO2 footprint. It’s also --  WALLACE: I don’t want to be a --  CROSSTALK  WALLACE: -- but you’re not going to tell me whether or not the president believes climate change is a hoax and whether or not human activity -- it's a simple question.  PRUITT: The president has indicated that the climate changes. It's always changing. I’ve indicated the same.  WALLACE: Well, that’s the same --  CROSSTALK  PRUITT: What's important, Chris, here -- what’s important is what the president did on Thursday is put America first and say to the United States and say to the world that we’re going to remain engaged, but we’re also going to make sure that as we remain engage, we put America’s interest first.  WALLACE: As you pointed out, the president justified pulling out of the Paris deal largely on economic terms. Here he is.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  TRUMP: The American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life.  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE: But the study that the president cited was funded by two groups that are dramatically opposed to environmental regulation and the study itself acknowledges it does -- this is a quote from the study -- it does not take into account the potential benefits from avoided emissions. The study results are not a benefit-cost analysis of climate change.  PRUITT: Well, there were several --  WALLACE: Administrator, it is a worst-case scenario.  PRUITT: There were several studies that were actually published in response to Paris. NERA, the Heritage study, the Global Policy publication --  WALLACE: You specifically quoted NERA.  PRUITT: There were several and -- that were sourced aspects as part of the speech.  And what we know from the Paris agreement objectively is that it was a $2.5 trillion contraction to our economy over ten years. What we do know is it impacted up to 400,000 jobs in this country. What we do know is it impacted both the manufacturing base and energy sector jobs.  You know, since last -- the fourth quarter of 2016, Chris, we've had almost 50,000 jobs created in the mining and coal sector alone. In fact, in the month of May, almost 7,000 jobs.  So, these individuals that are -- I think what’s also being missed here is that when you look at how we generate electricity in this country, the power grid. We need to feel diversity. We need coal, natural gas, hydro, renewables, nuclear, as part of that mix, because it provides stability and strength to our grid and lower cost. Our price per kilowatt compared to Germany, our price per kilowatt compared to Europe is far better and it helps us grow jobs in this country.  WALLACE: Mr. Pruitt, aren’t you focusing on the wrong thing?  I want to put up some, I’m going to say, surprising statistics. Take a look at this -- the U.S. now employs more than double the number of people in the solar industry than it does in coal. Aren’t you and the president talking about protecting the horse and buggy business just as cars come online?  PRUITT: Absolutely not, because as I just indicated, we need hydro -- we need hydrocarbon stored on-site at utility companies across this country to address something, attacks on our grid, attacks on infrastructure, if we have peaked demand needs, you want a diversity of fuels that generate electricity. It is bad business -- it is bad business for a country to limit the --  CROSSTALK  WALLACE: President Trump talks about protecting the people of Pittsburgh. The mayor of Pittsburgh said we’re not a steel town anymore, we’re a green town and, in fact, he rejected what the president said. And the mayor of Pittsburgh, the city he specifically cited, said, we’re going to comply with the Paris climate accord.  PRUITT: This president has said that we truly need an all-of-the-above approach. We should not penalize sectors of our economy, Chris. Government regulation shouldn't be used to pick winners and losers. The past administration declared a war on coal and there were several coal facilities across the country shut down because of their past efforts. That is not what government regulation should be about.  Government regulation should be about making things regular, not picking winners and losers, and making sure we have fuel diversity and generating electricity in this country. And as I indicated, the jobs numbers show already, already, that this president's deregulatory agenda, his leadership in the energy space is making a difference for jobs across this country, almost 50,000 in the coal sector --  WALLACE: I want to go to another issue, because the president also said that the Paris climate accord and pulling out of it isn't going to make all that much difference on the environment. Here he is.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  TRUMP: With total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree -- think of that, this much.  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE: But the people behind the MIT study, that study that he just cited say that he took a number from 2014 before the targets for the Paris accord were even reached. And the cofounder of the program said this about the White House: They found a number that made the point they want to make. It’s kind of a debate trick.  The people behind the study the president cited say, look, Paris isn’t going to solve everything. It isn’t going to solve global warming, but it makes an important contribution.  PRUITT: What short memories these folks have. What short memories they have.  James Hansen, former NASA scientist, the father of climate change, he's been called, called Paris a fake and a fraud, because of the very things the president cited. Two-tenths of one -- there are other studies. The Global Policy publication came out criticizing --  WALLACE: Are you going to speak to what the MIT authors --  CROSSTALK  PRUITT: Look, it’s very fishy to me that MIT updated their study or their results after we started citing it. No one is questioning their methodology. Nobody’s questioning their findings.  WALLACE: Well, in fact, you didn’t cite their study after Paris. You cited their study before Paris, in 2014.  PRUITT: What's interesting, Chris, is during the time before Paris, before Paris, this country reduce their CO2 footprint by over 18 percent, from 2000 to 2014. What does that demonstrate? It demonstrates that American innovation, American technology is leading the way with respect to reducing the CO2 footprint, not government mandate.  If China and India want to reduce their CO2 footprint, they should learn from us.  WALLACE: Well --  PRUITT: India, by the way, in the Paris agreement, talk about the merits of the deal, Chris, conditioned any steps that they would take on receiving $2.5 trillion of aid. China agreed to make no steps until the year 2030. They’re the largest polluters in the world.  WALLACE: Let me -- let me pick up on that because you've taken me exactly where I want to go.  CROSSTALK  WALLACE: Yes, this is working together.  The president had one more big complaint about Paris and he said that it treats the U.S. unfairly.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  TRUMP: China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can't build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE: But here again, sir, the reality is different, is very different from what the president said. China has canceled plans for more than 100 coal plants and promises 20 percent of its energy consumption will be green by 2030. India has pledged 40 percent of its energy will be renewable by 2030. And it’s set to pass Japan this year as the world's third-largest market for solar power.  So, it may not mandate it in the Paris agreement, but, in fact, China and India are going green already.  PRUITT: You know, what’s interesting -- one of the keywords that was up on the screen was plans. China was actually building over 360 new coal generation facilities and had 800 planned, Chris. So, maybe they've drawn back on the number that are planned, but they’re burning coal. And they’re going to continue to burn coal.  WALLACE: Well, we are burning coal.  PRUITT: Just for foreseeable future.  We’ve got a contraction with respect to our grid, quite substantially. We used to be well above 40 percent. We’re now down around 30 percent, if not less.  So, this country has frontloaded its costs. The rest of the world said, hey, we’ll get to that later. They applauded when -- when we joined Paris, the rest of the world applauded, not because of climate reductions, but because it put this country at an economic disadvantage. We -- the Clean Power Plan alone, the Clean Power Plan alone represented almost $300 million of compliance cost to our economy.  So, why wouldn’t Paris -- excuse me, why wouldn’t France and these other countries want us to stay in that kind of deal? It's a bad deal for this country. The president didn't say, by the way, that we weren’t going to continue engagement. The president -- he said Paris represents a bad deal for this country.  WALLACE: He also said we’re going to renegotiate and all of the leaders around the world, certainly in Europe, said: forget it.  PRUITT: Well, then, he also said, either a new deal or as part of the Paris agreement.  But we’re already part -- look, we are the United States, Chris. We don't lose our seat at the table. We joined the treaty in 1992, called the UNFCCC, with respect to climate change.  WALLACE: All right.  PRUITT: And that is still there. We’re going to remain engaged internationally, but we’re going to make sure that as we make deals, that we put the interest of America first. This was applauded by small business.  You know, it was interesting. The New York Times yesterday had an article that a small business that applauded --  WALLACE: I don't want you to filibuster so we can't get to Al Gore. We want to get to him.  PRUITT: OK.  WALLACE: You brought up a lot of legitimate points I’m going to ask him about.  Mr. Pruitt, thank you for your time. Always good to talk with you.  PRUITT: Thank you.  WALLACE: And thank you for answering our questions.  PRUITT: Thanks, Chris.  WALLACE: That's what it's all about.  Up next, former Vice President Al Gore on Mr. Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris accord.  COMMERCIAL BREAK  WALLACE: Coming up, former FBI Director James Comey is set to testify before Congress this week about his conversations with the president.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-SOUTH CAROLINA: I hope this hearing doesn't become a hitch on President Trump. There's a cloud over the presidency that needs to be removed.  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE: We’ll ask our Sunday panel what to expect.  COMMERCIAL BREAK  WALLACE: Former Vice President Al Gore's breakthrough documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, brought the topic of climate change to the forefront. Not surprisingly, he is one of the sharpest critics of Mr. Trump's decision this week. We welcome him for what we believe is his first appearance on Fox News since the 2000 campaign.  Mr. Vice President, good to have you back.  AL GORE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Great to be back, Chris. Thank you for inviting me.  WALLACE: Before we get to climate change, I want to ask you about this terrible attack in London. How do we stop these attacks on the west and is President Trump's travel been part of the answer?  GORE: Well, most of the attacks, both in England and here in the United States, have been by homegrown terrorists. And, of course, the courts will deal with the travel ban. They've already been struck down. We’ll see what the Supreme Court does.  This surge of terrorism, we -- we have to defeat it, but we have to defeat it not only with the force of arms, but with the force of our values. And I truly believe that giving people around the world a sense that the world’s got our act together and we’re going to move forward to a bright future is one of the important tasks at hand.  WALLACE: Let's turn to the subject at hand.  You met with President-elect Trump during the transition to discuss climate change and afterwards you said this.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  GORE: I had a -- a lengthy and very productive session with the president-elect. It was a sincere search for areas of common ground.  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE: You also talked with Mr. Trump, we’re told, last month about staying in the Paris climate deal. Did you misjudge the president?  GORE: Well, I've kept my communications with him confidential. I think that's the right way to handle it. But none of it would surprise you. I did my best to persuade him it was in our country's best interest to stay in the Paris agreement. I -- I thought there was a chance that he would do that. I'm sorry that he made the other decision.  WALLACE: How do you explain it?  GORE: Well, you’d have to ask him for the explanation. It makes no sense to me. I think that it was a reckless decision, and indefensible decision. I think it undermines our nations standing in the world and isolates us and threatens to harm humanity's ability to solve this crisis in time.  But, make no mistake about it, the -- this country is going to continue to solve the climate crisis. Governors like Jerry Brown and Andrew Cuomo, Jay Inslee, many others, mayors, Mike Bloomberg’s doing a great job rallying mayors around the country. We are going to continue reducing emissions. Atlanta just decided to go 100 percent renewable and there are many, many others.  WALLACE: Let’s talk -- and I -- you heard me challenge Scott Pruitt. I’m going to challenge you. Let's talk about some of the concerns that people have about Paris. President Trump talked about one.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  TRUMP: It includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called green climate fund, nice name.  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE: Under the Paris Accord, 37 developed countries agreed to provide $100 billion to developing countries. Why is that fair?  GORE: Well, you know, when the Marshall Plan was launched by the United States after World War II, it ended up benefiting us tremendously, as well as making the world a better place. We would have been -- we would be 11th on the list of nations per capita in -- in helping the country to meet this climate challenge. And, by the way, one of the opportunities for us is to export our products and create more jobs here. You showed some jobs in the solar industry earlier. Solar jobs are now growing 17 times faster than other jobs. It's the brightest spot. If we get out there in the economy, if we get out there and help lead the sustainability revolution, it benefits our economy.  WALLACE: But here's the thing -- problem I think a lot of people have. Countries like the U.S., which have been developing an industrial economy since the 19th century, the argument is that somehow we owe something to countries that didn't.  GORE: Well, it’s a global challenge in the world community as a whole has to -- has to face up to it. This administration has said there's no such thing as a global community. Actually, there is, because we, as a civilization, are putting 110 million tons of heat trapping global warming pollution up into the sky every day as if it's an open sewer.  And, you know, the climate crisis is real, Chris. I -- I’m -- I'm sure you know that.

054fefab,"January 11, 2017 WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.) today urged Senate Democrats to work with Republicans to repeal Obamacare and clear the way for solutions that will expand access to quality, affordable health care for all Americans. A vote on legislation that provides Congress the tools to repeal Obamacare is expected in the Senate later today. “Democrats have failed to live up to nearly every promise they made when they forced Obamacare through Congress without a single Republican vote,” Blunt said. “Despite all of their claims to the contrary, this law has forced millions of Americans off the plans and doctors they liked and could afford, drastically driven up premiums and deductibles, and slashed the number of health plan options available to families.” This year, 97 Missouri counties have only one insurer participating in the Obamacare exchanges. Last year, every Missouri county had at least two insurance options. In addition, most Missourians will see an increase in their premiums, with some facing an increase upward of 40 percent. Blunt continued, “Now is the time for Senate Democrats to start making things right. They’ll have that opportunity today when the Senate considers a resolution that gives Congress the tools to repeal Obamacare and pave the way for solutions that will expand access to quality, affordable health care. By taking this first step toward repealing Obamacare, Republicans are keeping the promises we made to the American people. I urge all of my Democrat colleagues to do the same.”","SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES No. 18A335 RICHARD BRAKEBILL, ET AL. v.

(CNN) Following a successful international tour and the G-7 Summit in Italy, President Trump has an opportunity to relieve our nation of the unfair and economically devastating requirements of the Paris Agreement, the United Nations climate treaty he pledged to rip up during the campaign.  And as soon as possible , President Trump should act on -- and keep -- his campaign promise.  The agreement, signed by the Obama administration last year, would commit the United States to drastically reducing its carbon emissions while allowing some countries to increase theirs. This, all while doing nothing to meaningfully decrease global temperatures.  According to a recent National Economic Research Associates Economic Consulting study, the Paris Agreement could obliterate $3 trillion of GDP, 6.5 million industrial sector jobs and $7,000 in per capita household income from the American economy by 2040. Meeting the 2025 emissions reduction target alone could subtract $250 billion from our GDP and eliminate 2.7 million jobs. The cement, iron and steel, and petroleum refining industries could see their production cut by 21% 19%, and 11% respectively.  Not only would these unfair standards reduce American job growth and wages and increase monthly utility costs for hardworking families, they would fundamentally disadvantage the United States in the global economy. The result: our economic output would lag while other countries continued to expand their GDPs.  The agreement's proponents market it as a panacea for addressing the impacts of climate change, but at its core, it is about increasing government control -- over the economy, the energy sector and nearly every aspect of our daily lives. It represents the exact misguided, top-down, government-knows-best approach that American voters resoundingly rejected in 2016.  We cannot pursue a path that puts American workers first if we cripple a fossil fuel energy sector that generates 82% of the energy consumed in the United States. The coal industry alone supplies almost one-third of America's electric power -- with an increasing amount of clean coal-burning technology becoming available.  America is poised to become a net energy exporter over the next decade. We should not abandon that progress at the cost of weakening our energy renaissance and crippling economic growth.  And let's not forget the massive utility cost increases the agreement would entail. The Clean Power Plan, a major component of fulfilling the agreement, would spike energy costs for working and middle-class Texans by 16% by 2030 , according to the Economic Reliability Council of Texas, the entity that operates the electric grid for much of our state.  We simply cannot afford an agreement that puts thousands of Americans out of work, increases their energy costs and devastates our core industries.  In return for crippling our economy, the Paris Agreement would do next to nothing to impact global temperatures. Under the EPA's own models, if all carbon emissions in America were basically eliminated, global temperatures would only decrease by less than two-tenths of a degree Celsius.  While the agreement would have a negligible impact on temperatures, America would be putting itself at a competitive disadvantage. That's because while the Obama administration irresponsibly committed America to immediate, real cuts in emissions, our global economic competitors would have no such handicap. In fact, Russia is permitted to increase its emissions approximately 50% and China and India have no meaningful cap on emissions until 2030.  This disparity among the countries' pledges inflicts real losses on our economy now while our rivals continue to grow, industrialize and diversify at their own pace with no implementation costs. In the meantime, the agreement would force American taxpayers to subsidize alternative energy at the expense of clean coal, nuclear power and natural gas -- energy resources that actually work for our economy and our environment.  The Paris Agreement would also handicap America in the global race for new sources of energy. Russia has committed financial and military assets to the Arctic to stake its claim to the region's vast deepwater mineral, oil and gas deposits. China is also exploring and trading for Arctic oil and gas. Meanwhile, American liquefied natural gas struggles with logistical costs that weaken its competitiveness.  By allowing our rivals to increase their cooperation and strategic leverage around the world -- pressuring our allies and partners, harming domestic job creators and materially reducing our prestige and influence in the process --- the agreement would damage America's national security as much as our economic security. The emission cuts that the US would have to make today, and the resultant costs for our own energy firms, would weaken our ability to battle our rivals on an equal footing in the drive for untapped energy sources.  Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook  Efforts to unwind some of the deal's more onerous regulations are welcomed, but that is not enough. Unless the US completely withdraws, the Paris Agreement will continue to cause sustained harm to our security and economy, and it keeps the door open for future administrations to use it as means to impose more costly and ineffective energy regulations.  We should not let a deal subject to the whims of future administrations or Congresses hang like a wet blanket over our economy -- driving up energy prices, devastating our industrial base and bolstering our rivals.  I hope President Trump will take the opportunity before him to fulfill the commitment he made and withdraw America from the Paris Agreement.",Ted Cruz: Trump should withdraw from Paris climate pact,mixture,
27838a55,"By Wayne LaPierre  Before I tell you how the NRA and our members are going to Stand And Fight politically and in the courts, let’s acknowledge that all over this country, tens of millions of Americans are already preparing to Stand And Fight to protect their families and homes.  These good Americans are prudently getting ready to protect themselves.  It has always been sensible for good citizens to own and carry firearms for lawful protection against violent criminals who prey on decent people.  During the second Obama term, however, additional threats are growing. Latin American drug gangs have invaded every city of significant size in the United States. Phoenix is already one of the kidnapping capitals of the world, and though the states on the U.S./Mexico border may be the first places in the nation to suffer from cartel violence, by no means are they the last.  The president flagrantly defies the 2006 federal law ordering the construction of a secure border fence along the entire Mexican border. So the border today remains porous not only to people seeking jobs in the U.S., but to criminals whose jobs are murder, rape, robbery and kidnapping. Ominously, the border also remains open to agents of al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations. Numerous intelligence sources have confirmed that foreign terrorists have identified the southern U.S. border as their path of entry into the country.  When the next terrorist attack comes, the Obama administration won’t accept responsibility. Instead, it will do what it does every time: blame a scapegoat and count on Obama’s “mainstream” media enablers to go along.  A heinous act of mass murder—either by terrorists or by some psychotic who should have been locked up long ago—will be the pretext to unleash a tsunami of gun control.  No wonder Americans are buying guns in record numbers right now, while they still can and before their choice about which firearm is right for their family is taken away forever.  After Hurricane Sandy, we saw the hellish world that the gun prohibitionists see as their utopia. Looters ran wild in south Brooklyn. There was no food, water or electricity. And if you wanted to walk several miles to get supplies, you better get back before dark, or you might not get home at all.  Anti-gun New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg had already done everything he could to prevent law-abiding New Yorkers from owning guns, and he has made sure that no ordinary citizen will ever be allowed to carry a gun. He even refused to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns!  Meanwhile, President Obama is leading this country to financial ruin, borrowing over a trillion dollars a year for phony “stimulus” spending and other payoffs for his political cronies. Nobody knows if or when the fiscal collapse will come, but if the country is broke, there likely won’t be enough money to pay for police protection. And the American people know it.  Hurricanes. Tornadoes. Riots. Terrorists. Gangs. Lone criminals. These are perils we are sure to face—not just maybe. It’s not paranoia to buy a gun. It’s survival. It’s responsible behavior, and it’s time we encourage law-abiding Americans to do just that.  Since the election, millions of Americans have been lining up in front of gun stores, Cabela’s and Bass Pro Shops exercising their freedom while they still have it. They are demonstrating they have a mass determination to buy, own and use firearms. Millions of Americans are using market forces like never before to demonstrate their ardent support for our firearm freedoms. That’s one of the very best ways we can Stand And Fight.  Inevitably, the anti-gun media and the gun-ban lobbies are demonizing the purchase of firearms. They call us “extremists” because we wonder whether we will be able to buy a semi-auto in three years or, even in some states, later this year. That’s despite the fact that President Obama long ago made clear that he wants to ban them all!  The media try to make rank-and-file Americans feel guilty about buying a gun. The enemies of freedom demonize gun buyers and portray us as social lepers. But we know the truth. We know that responsible gun ownership exemplifies what is good and right about America.  Responsible Americans realize that the world as we know it has changed. We, the American people, clearly see the daunting forces we will undoubtedly face: terrorists, crime, drug gangs, the possibility of Euro-style debt riots, civil unrest or natural disaster.  Gun owners are not buying firearms because they anticipate a confrontation with the government. Rather, we anticipate confrontations where the government isn’t there—or simply doesn’t show up in time.  To preserve the inalienable, individual human right to keep and bear arms—to withstand the siege that is coming—the NRA is building a four-year communications and resistance movement. The enemies of the Second Amendment will be met with unprecedented defiance, commitment and determination. We will Stand And Fight.  First, we are going to devise legal capability like never before. I fervently hope that President Obama does not get to appoint another anti-gun Supreme Court justice like Sonia Sotomayor or Elena Kagan. But he probably will, and we must meet that challenge. His chances of appointing a replacement for one of the five pro-rights justices in the 5-4 Heller and McDonald majorities are high. And there’s no doubt he is going to appoint a huge number of new judges to lifetime positions in the lower federal courts.  That means the federal courts are going to get worse and worse. So some cases, on which we might have improved our chances of victory by waiting a while, are going to have to be brought now.  Besides bringing affirmative pro-rights cases, we will also have to litigate against the flood of new anti-gun federal regulations that are coming, and against anti-gun laws that are going to be enacted in some of the states.  Second, we must strengthen the NRA like never before. We are, and always have been, a genuine grassroots organization. And never has your membership been more important. Never has the nra been more in need of your support.  The national media, with its slanted and inaccurate “news” coverage of the gun issue, has given the gun-ban groups the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars of free advertising.  Now, the threat is even greater. Michael Bloomberg and George Soros are each, individually, far wealthier than the entire National Rifle Association. When the NRA spends money on political advertising, we have to raise those funds from you—$20, $50, $250, or $1,000 at a time. In the last election, Bloomberg alone spent $16 million and that doesn’t even count the indirect spending by groups funded by Soros and his fellow billionaires.  The hard truth is that due to Bloomberg, Soros, and the rest of their ilk, the dangers require that we increase our presence all across the country—in Congress, the state capitols, and in your city and towns.  As we Stand And Fight, the third, and most important, part of our action plan demands that we organize like never before. That’s the most important part of all.  Every gun owner should be an active member of the NRA. Every gun owner should be sure that every member of his or her family is an active member.  For most of the last hundred years, a strong NRA has been the indispensable shield against the destruction of our nation’s Second Amendment rights. Now, an even stronger nra is the only chance gun owners have to withstand the coming siege.  This begins with remembering to keep your own membership active, or reactivate it if it has lapsed. It means reminding yourself, “I have a son and daughter who aren’t members and should be.” It means reaching out to your hunting and shooting friends and personally telling them why it’s so important that they join the NRA now, during this time of peril.  The NRA is launching a nationwide, full-court initiative to urge every gun owner, and every non-gun-owning lover of freedom, to join the NRA and fight this battle. I will personally be traveling all over America enlisting new members.  We must reach out to the tens of millions of gun owners who are not yet NRA members—to the gun owners who care about their own rights but who have been duped by Obama and the national media into believing that the Obama and Bloomberg gun controls will only affect other people. They are naively sitting on the sidelines, imagining themselves immune from the coming siege.  Yet no matter how much I travel, I can’t be everywhere. NRA members, though, can be everywhere. We already are. The 4 million of us belong to every community in the United States. We are the largest civil rights organization in the world, and we have been part of the fabric of America ever since 1871. So it is you, proud NRA members, who are the key to enlisting new members in the ranks of our army of freedom.  NRA grassroots has always been our Association’s greatest strength. To compete with Bloomberg and his gang, it must be much stronger still. Historically, we have always been able to rely on volunteers, and I’m going to ask you and need you to answer the call to help throughout the next four years.  Every year, shooting is becoming more and more popular, with more people engaging in the shooting sports for fun. More people are buying guns and trying new disciplines, such as 3-gun competitions, sporting clays, practical shooting and so on.  As we Stand And Fight, let’s continue to make the shooting sports one of the fastest-growing recreational activities in America. By doing so, and by telling others about it, we’ll popularize and make gun owning and shooting more mainstream than ever before. That will be even more effective if we remember to invite new people to participate and provide them with the responsible mentorship and guidance that the NRA has exemplified for over 140 years.  We can’t win the political war if we lose the cultural war. One of the great protectors of the Second Amendment is the popular, active, responsible use of firearms for shooting and hunting.  We don’t want America to become like England, where some of that nation’s outstanding rifle competitors keep their hobby a dark secret from their neighbors for fear of social disapproval. We’re not going to let the anti-gunners push us into that zone. As I remind people every day, we are the majority.  We have so much to be proud of as gun owners, shooters and freedom lovers. That pride, especially when it’s not hidden in the closet, is itself a form of protection for the Second Amendment.  We will not surrender. We will not appease. We will buy more guns than ever. We will use them for sport and lawful self-defense more than ever. We will grow the NRA more than ever. And we will be prouder than ever to be freedom-loving NRA patriots. And with your help, we will ensure that the Second Amendment remains America’s First Freedom.  We will Stand And Fight.",Stand and Fight,mixture,

Biden is now coming under fire for leaving contracted working Service Dogs behind in Afghanistan.  The American Humane Group said the K-9’s are now at the hands of our enemy. The nonprofit is calling upon Congress to take action to classify working dogs on the same level as military working dogs.  American Humane Group CEO Robin Ganzert released a statement saying, “I am devastated by reports that the American government is pulling out of Kabul and leaving behind brave U.S. military contract working dogs to be tortured and killed at the hand of our enemies. These brave dogs do the same dangerous, lifesaving work as our military working dogs, and deserved a far better fate than the one to which they have been condemned.”  Veteran Sheep Dogs of America, among other groups, are currently working to evacuate the animals.  Furthermore, dogs are considered “unclean” in Islam, causing concerns on the future of their lives under Taliban rule.

Photos circulating online were animals under the care of the Kabul Small Animal Rescue, not dogs under our care. — John Kirby (@PentagonPresSec) August 31, 2021  But, the official press release from SPCA International, says, “In the end, the dogs and their caretakers were explicitly NOT allowed to board military aircraft, and numerous private charter aircraft were not granted access to the airport either. Charlotte was informed that most of the KSAR dogs had to be released into the airport on August 30 as the airport was evacuated – turning once rescued shelter dogs into homeless strays. They were not given access to the flight we had secured to transport them out of the country.”  Continuing, “They are within the airport in an area used for housing employees at the far end of the flight line. We haven’t been able to confirm the number of dogs released, nor can we confirm whether the U.S. Military evacuated the 46 working dogs that had been under KSAR’s care when they left.

Read also Kremlin mum on possible tit-for-tat measures in response to recent US sanctions Washington’s current actions harm the CWC integrity and the authority of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, with which Russia cooperated most closely in the process of implementing the national program for the elimination of chemical weapons, the Foreign Ministry said. The United States has more than once demonstrated its contemptuous attitude to the system of international law and the wish to use the existing multilateral arms control mechanisms for advancing its own political agenda. Hypocritical position The Foreign Ministry recalled that the United States tries to incriminate Russia of an act of using chemical weapons in the so-called Skripal case. Nobody has been able to present any evidence of this yet. In defiance of our repeated requests the British side has refused to cooperate in investigating the March 4 incident in Salisbury, the Foreign Ministry said. The US Department of State in its notification to Russia questions the full elimination of the Russian chemical weapons arsenal. They prefer to ignore the fact that the Russian program for the elimination of chemical weapons, completed last year, was implemented under strict international control in strict compliance with the CWC, the Foreign Ministry said. We regard the groundless charges of complicity in the Salisbury incident, put forward against Russia, as yet another attempt to create an impression our country takes an irresponsible attitude to compliance with international commitments, the statement runs. This approach looks particularly hypocritical in a situation where the United States is in no hurry to eliminate its own arsenal of chemical weapons and remains the sole CWC signatory that keeps considerable amounts of chemical warfare agents.

This is a virus that, without adequate restrictions in place, spreads with ferocity. Case rates are increasing again, hospital admissions are climbing again. R is edging up again. “Last week the England wide rate was 159 per 100,000. Now its 188 per 100,000. That’s a 20 per cent increase. Across London cases have increased 30 per cent in a week, the East of England 36 per cent. “None of us are surprised at the action he is taking today. Indeed he was warned that Tier 2 wouldn’t be enough to contain the spread of this virus. Now it looks like in some areas, such as Kent, Tier 3 isn’t enough to contain the spread either. “Elsewhere in the country Tier 3 areas appears to be broadly flat lining, with some like North West trending down. But overall the increasing areas are rising faster than the decreasing areas are falling. “As things stand, we are heading into the Christmas easing with diminishing headroom. The buffer zone these tiers were supposed to provide is getting much thinner. “So what is his plan to keep people safe through Christmas and to avoid huge pressures in the NHS in January? What is his plan to support an exhausted, understaffed NHS through January to deliver the care patients will need? And is he confident that our NHS won’t be so overwhelmed in January that it impacts the vaccination programme? “Our response to Covid-19 could have been stronger had Serco’s contact tracing not left a gaping hole in our defences. In boroughs like Islington only 65 per cent of contacts were traced by the national system. In Tower Hamlets only 60 per cent; In Barking 61 per cent. “Test and Trace is costing £22 billion – more than the policing and fire service combined – and yet according to the NAO, up to September only £785 million was allocated to local council public health teams. “Serco have subcontracted to 21 other firms offering little training to staff, with some in call centres alongside others making sales calls for gambling websites. It’s time to scrap Serco, and put all public health teams in the lead doing the retrospective cluster busting contact tracing we need. “He has promised more testing for Tier 3 areas, what about Tier 2 areas? On Lateral Flow Tests some care home providers refused to use them due to concerns about their accuracy, is he satisfied these tests are accurate enough for this purpose and are safe? And if they can’t be used for care homes how quickly can care home residents’ relatives makes use of PCR tests? “He often praises Liverpool. But isn’t the biggest lesson to draw from Liverpool that people still struggle to isolate if they haven’t got the financial means to do so? “The eligibility criteria for the £500 payment is too tightly drawn. People need decent sick pay. People in some circumstances need alternative accommodation. People need help with shopping and medicines. Surely some of the £22 billion spent on Test and Trace could be reallocated to offer people isolation support? “On the mutation in the virus identified, our constituents will be naturally concerned – will he keep the house updated on this? “Finally, today I spoke to Fred Banning. Fred is just 38. He has two children under 10. His cancer is terminal. He asks that those with terminal illness and given quicker access to the vaccine, so he can – in his words to me – “make the most of the time he has left with his family’.

Our administration has eliminated 22 federal regulations for every new rule put on the books. Vice President Mike Pence addresses the crowd at the America First Policies event in Rosemont, Ill.Charles Rex Arbogast / AP Photographer, File by Mike Pence, For the Inquirer
Published Jul 22, 2018 When I visit Philadelphia on Monday, I will deliver an important message to the hardworking men and women of the Keystone State: Our agenda is delivering real results – and we're just getting started. Simply look at the historic tax cuts that President Trump signed last December. With the strong support of every Pennsylvania Republican in Congress, we enacted the largest tax cuts and reform in American history.
Under our tax cuts, the first $24,000 of income for a married couple is now 100 percent income-tax free, nearly double what it was before. We also increased the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000. And we cut out the core of ObamaCare by eliminating the individual mandate tax, so Pennsylvanians will no longer be forced to buy government-mandated health insurance you don't want and can't afford. All told, the typical family of four in the Philadelphia area will save nearly $2,500 on their taxes every single year. This is a win for working families. It means a down payment on a car, a new refrigerator, or saving a little bit more for your kids' education. We also cut taxes on job creators of all sizes. Businesses across the Keystone State and around the nation have already responded with renewed investment in their workers. Nationwide, more than 6 million Americans — including at least 73,000 Pennsylvanians – have received bigger pay raises, better benefits, and cash bonuses because of our tax cuts.
But this is just the beginning. As businesses continue to invest their tax-cut savings in their workers, we estimate that annual wages for Pennsylvania families will rise by more than $4,200 in the years ahead. The Keystone State is represented by strong Republican leaders in our nation's capital who helped pass our tax cuts, including Congressman Lou Barletta. Rep. Barletta and his Republican colleagues stood with President Trump to put more money in the pockets of working families and job creators, and they deserve Pennsylvania's thanks. The same can't be said of Sen. Bob Casey. Sen. Casey voted against cutting your taxes – and time and again, he votes against the policies that Pennsylvania's working families need.
The evidence is clear: Our tax cuts are working for Pennsylvania, and so is the rest of our agenda. Working with the Keystone State's conservatives in Congress, President Trump has signed more laws rolling back federal red tape than any president in American history. Our administration has eliminated 22 federal regulations for every new rule put on the books. We've also unleashed affordable American energy to power our factories, farms, and homes. We're standing up to predatory trade practices from countries, such as China, and we're fighting tirelessly to break down trade barriers, so Pennsylvania farmers and manufacturers have new opportunities to expand and export and create more jobs right here in Philadelphia.
The results have been extraordinary. Since the Keystone State voted to send President Trump to the White House, America's job creators have added nearly 3.7 million new jobs. More than 115,000 have been created in Pennsylvania alone –including more than 10,000 manufacturing jobs. And the unemployment rate in the Philadelphia metro area is now at its lowest level ever recorded. But for all we've done, there's still more work to do. The good people of Pennsylvania can be assured that we will continue to keep our promises to you. President Trump made that clear once again when he nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be the next justice on the Supreme Court. Like all the principled jurists who we've put on the federal courts, Judge Kavanaugh will uphold all the God-given liberties enshrined in the Constitution of the United States. Under President Trump, the forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. In the days ahead, with the continued support of the hardworking men and women of Pennsylvania, we'll finish what we've started, and we will Make America Great Again.

81a67c96,"Former state House Majority Leader Adam Hasner, now running in a crowded Republican primary to challenge Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson in 2012, came out swinging against the federal health-care law backed by President Barack Obama. On Wednesday morning, noting that oral arguments would begin in the constitutional challenge launched by Florida and other states against the law, Hasner insisted the health-care law was undermining economic recovery. ""Today, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeal in Atlanta will hear oral arguments from 26 states seeking to overturn President Obama and Senator Bill Nelson's unconstitutional health-care takeover. Led by Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, the states have already won significant legal victories against this overreach by the federal government, said Hasner. ""Attorney General Bondi is right to focus on the need for states to protect and defend the individual liberties of their citizens, as well as preserve the constitutional principle of limited government. But there is an important economic component to defeating Obamacare, as well. ""Implementation of Obamacare has played a major role in prolonging our country's economic challenges. Earlier this year, the head of the Congressional Budget Office testified before Congress that implementation of Obamacare would cost 800,000 jobs. Here in Florida, nearly 1 million Floridians are already out of work and the myriad regulations, taxes, and rules contained in Obamacare have only caused more worry and hesitation among the small-business men and women and job creators I've met with during the past three months, added Hasner. ""Individual liberty and limited government are paramount toward the defeat of Obamacare, but we should also never forget the incredible toll this massive overreach of government will take on our economic freedoms, as well. Getting Florida and America back to work requires expanding economic freedoms, and getting Washington regulations out of the way of job creators. There's no better place to start than by defeating Obamacare in the courts and repealing it in Congress.""",- The Washington Post,mixture,

bc815fa3,"President Vladimir Putin held his annual end-of-year press conference on Thursday, answering questions from state media and independent journalists on an array of topics related to Russia's domestic and foreign policy. Here are the highlights from the marathon presser that lasted four hours and 19 minutes: On constitutional term limits for the presidency: — One thing that could be changed about these [presidential] terms is removing the clause about 'successive' [terms]. Your humble servant served two terms consecutively, then left his post, but with the constitutional right to return to the post of president again, because these two terms were not successive. [This clause] troubles some of our political analysts and public figures. Well, maybe it could be removed. On climate change: — “But we're not really sure why global warming is happening, but we need to do something about it.” — “We have the greenest energy system in the world. New industries have been created: liquefied natural gas, hydropower. Those who believe that we live on old resources are deeply mistaken.” On U.S. President Donald Trump’s impeachment: — You phrase your question as if Trump's presidency is coming to an end. I am not sure that's the case. [The impeachment bill] still needs to go through the Senate where Republicans as far as I know have a majority. It's unlikely they will want to remove from power a representative of their party based on what are, in my opinion, completely fabricated reasons. On Russia’s spat with Germany over the killing of an ex-Chechen rebel in Berlin: — “The issue of extraditing Khangoshvili was discussed at the level of our special services but there was no official request, because we knew that it would be refused.” — “This is an absolute bloody killer. He killed 98 people in the Caucasus — think about it. He participated in the attacks in the Moscow metro.” On the election of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson: — Johnson can be congratulated. He was victorious after all and had a better sense of the British public's mood than his political opponents. And as far as I understand, he intends to implement all of his Brexit plans. — In regards to [Russian] interference or non-interference, we've heard many times from official governing bodies in various countries, including Britain, assessments of what is happening inside Russia. Is that interference? On China: — We do not have a military alliance with China and we do not plan to create one. — But our relations with China continue to develop, including in the sphere of defence technologies... I think China is capable of producing its own ballistic missile early warning system, but with our help it can do so sooner. This will improve our strategic partner's ability to defend itself in a significant way. On the Libyan conflict: — Russia is in touch with [Libyan Prime Minister Fayez] al-Serraj and with [eastern Libyan commander Khalifa] Haftar. We are also constantly maintaining dialogue with our partners, including Turkey, Europe and other countries. — In our opinion, the best outcome would be for an agreement to be reached between the two conflicting sides that would lead to an end to military actions, and would establish who will rule the country, how, and what responsibilities they would have. On extending the New START arms control treaty with the U.S.: — We are ready until the end of the year to extend the existing agreement, the new START treaty. — But thus far there has been no answer to any of our suggestions.

1aff43d1,"The Mail today launches a campaign to save Britain's high streets – after a staggering 50,000 retail jobs were axed in the first half of this year.  The figures expose the bloodbath up and down the country as hundreds of stores – from major chains to small shops – shut their doors.  Business leaders, shopkeepers and MPs blame punitive business rates that cripple high streets and hand a huge advantage to internet giants.  Today chief executives of some of the country's biggest chains, along with politicians from all parties, demand reform as they warn that sky-high rates are stifling investment and driving long-established companies to the wall.  The Mail is launching a campaign to save Britain's high street after 50,000 retail jobs were axed  Last year shops closed at a rate of 16 every day. Figures compiled by the Press Association show that between January and June this year, 50,000 jobs were either lost or expected to go.  In recent months the trail of destruction has hit household names including House of Fraser – which has put 6,000 jobs under threat – and Poundworld, which plunged into administration endangering a further 5,100.  Toys R Us and Maplin collapsed, while chains such as Prezzo, Byron and Jamie's Italian shut restaurants and culled hundreds of jobs.  Meanwhile, the taxman is raking in more and more from business rates – with a total haul of £30.8 billion predicted this year, up from £29.6 billion last year.  The vast majority comes from major retailers in the heart of towns and cities, while online stores and out-of-town shopping centres pay much less in both rates and corporation tax.  Critics say high business rates which force firms to go bust are self-defeating, as they reduce tax revenues.  Marks & Spencer, which is closing more than 100 stores in the next four years with hundreds of jobs at risk, told the Mail that rising rates were partly to blame for its drastic plans.  Chief executive Steve Rowe said: 'Business rates are an unfair burden of taxation directly contributing to the challenges the high street is facing. The long-term effects of these charges are now a reality.  'Our Covent Garden store faced a rate rise of close to a half a million pounds in the year before it closed, an untenable position for any retailer.  Today chief executives of some of the country's biggest chains, along with politicians from all parties, demand reform as they warn that sky-high rates are stifling investment and driving long-established companies to the wall  'These challenges will continue until the system is reformed to create a level playing field between high street and online retailers.'  Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis said: 'UK retail is the most employment-dense sector of the economy, so constantly losing businesses in the way we are will have an economic impact.  'And so if they're not careful the Government risk taking too much out of business rates and then losing in the medium term.'  Labour MP Frank Field, chairman of the Commons work and pensions committee, said: 'The taxation of online retailers and firms which funnel their profits abroad should be changed now.  'A specific sales tax should be put on those firms that compete against the high street and barely pay a penny to the Government. Reform is long overdue.'  Senior Tory backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg said: 'Business rates have not kept up with economic change.  High street shops are penalised while online sellers face lower charges giving them another competitive advantage.'  Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said: 'This is a very important and welcome campaign.  Last year shops closed at a rate of 16 every day. Figures compiled by the Press Association show that between January and June this year, 50,000 jobs were either lost or expected to go  'There must be a level playing field and this campaign would be a significant step to achieving that.'  Business rates are based on the estimated rental value of a property. It means that traditional retailers such as department stores with large premises in town and city centres are hit particularly hard, while newer internet rivals such as Amazon pay far less.  Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said one in five of his organisation's members had thought about closing down or selling up because of the pressure from business rates.  He said: 'Along with spiralling rents, increasing labour costs and weakening consumer demand, rising business rates bills are threatening high streets across the country.  'Business rates are an unfair and regressive tax, which hit firms before they've made their first penny in turnover, let alone profit.'  Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, added: 'The broken business rates system puts pressure on firms of all shapes and sizes, taking no account of economic circumstances or business performance.  'In this climate of sluggish growth and weak investment, a system which saps funds and undermines firms' investment potential is particularly jarring.'  The Institute of Directors and Confederation of British Industry also backed calls for reform.  Business leaders, shopkeepers and MPs blame punitive business rates that cripple high streets and hand a huge advantage to internet giants  Meanwhile, pub and restaurant bosses say rates have made it hard to survive in an industry where profits have always been tight and rising inflation has put them under even more pressure.  Experts say 2018 will go down in history as the 'year of the Company Voluntary Arrangement' – an insolvency procedure used to push through several store closure programmes this year.  Robert Hayton, head of UK business rates at Altus Group, said: 'Business rates are rarely the sole driver for insolvencies but certainly a contributory factor, with bills having risen by more than a fifth through inflation during the seven years before last year's revaluation.  'Add that to the lethal cocktail of other increased operating costs for the national living wage and apprenticeship levy and it creates the perfect storm.'  The Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank says business rates should be torn up and replaced with a new system where the value of the land itself is taxed, rather than the buildings on top of it.  Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said: 'Government ministers will weep crocodile tears about the situation, but it is government policy that is partly to blame, given the lamentable failure of the Government to shift the unfair burden of business rates away from hard-pressed high street retailers and find a way of taxing online retailers more effectively.'","Daily Mail campaign to save Britain's high streets after 50,000 retail jobs cut",mixture,
fdddd52c,"Authorities in Australia have confirmed the bushfires were caused by arsonists and a series of lightning strikes, not “climate change” as many activists have claimed. Since November, the fires have devastated various regions in New South Wales, destroying thousands of buildings and killing at least 22 people. Summit.news reports: Despite the fact that bushfires are not uncommon in Australia, the severity of the damage led numerous climate change alarmists to blame the disaster on man-made global warming.
Earlier this week, Bernie Sanders blamed those who were “delaying action on climate change” for “the blood-red sky and unbreathable air in Australia because of raging forest fires.” However, according to those tasked with investigating the fires, climate change has nothing to do with it. @7NewsSydney Police are now working on the premise arson is to blame for much of the devastation caused this bushfire season. A strike force will investigate whether blazes were deliberately lit, and bring those responsible to justice. http://7NEWS.com.au @ebatten7 #NSWFires #7NEWS Embedded video “Police are now working on the premise arson is to blame for much of the devastation caused this bushfire season,” reports 7 News Sydney. Authorities in the country have formed Strike Force Indarra, comprising of detectives from homicide and arson units in an attempt to find the culprits. Other causes for the fires include lightning strikes and a natural weather phenomenon called Dipole, again neither of which have anything to do with man-made climate change. Many bushfires are also actually caused by environmentalist ‘green’ policies which prevent land owners from clearing their own vegetation to protect themselves. “Governments appeasing the green beast have ignored numerous state and federal bushfire inquiries over the past decade, almost all of which have recommended increasing the practice of “prescribed burning,” writes Miranda Devine. “Also known as “hazard reduction”, it is a methodical regime of burning off flammable ground cover in cooler months, in a controlled fashion, so it does not fuel the inevitable summer bushfires.” As ever with climate change alarmists, they don’t let the facts get in the way of a good power grab.","Briefing by Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova, Moscow, April 4, 2019",mixture,
,"Further evidence proving the Covid-19 vaccination programme is a huge failure has been released which confirms throughout the whole of August 80% of the people who allegedly died of Covid-19 had been vaccinated against the disease.  We’re living in strange times, and if you believe the Covid-19 vaccination programme is working because the authorities on the television tell you that it is, then you must surely find it extremely strange that the UK is in the middle of a third wave in the middle of summer? Especially when you consider that in summer 2020 Covid-19 deaths flat-lined to zero even though a Covid-19 injection was not available.  But the strangeness doesn’t end there, just take a look at the latest Covid-19 Statistical Report released by Public Health Scotland (PHS) on the 8th September 2021.  The report provides an array on data on testing, quarantining, vaccinations, cases, hospitalisations, and deaths but it doesn’t get very interesting until you read Table 15 which covers the number of Covid-19 positive cases by week and vaccination status.  Interesting because it shows that the majority of confirmed cases are now among the vaccinated population. In the most recent week from 28th August to 3rd September 2021 the report shows that there were 20,744 confirmed cases among the unvaccinated population, who are more likely to be tested for the simple reason they have not been vaccinated.  But it also shows that there were 5,508 confirmed cases among the partly vaccinated population, and 16,810 cases among the fully vaccinated population – two populations who are least likely to be tested due to be being vaccinated.  This means that between 28th August and 3rd September there were 22,318 cases among the vaccinated population – almost 2,000 more than the unvaccinated population.  The same can also be said for the week of 21st August to 27th August which saw 15,647 cases among the unvaccinated population and 22,234 cases among the vaccinated population, and the same can also be said for the previous two weeks before that.  The data actually shows that between 7th August 2021 and the 3rd September 2021 there were 47,580 cases among the unvaccinated population, 21,020 cases among the partly vaccinated population, and 41,748 cases among the fully vaccinated population. Meaning there were 15,188 more cases among the vaccinated population.  So now that we’ve cleared up that the experimental Covid-19 injections clearly do not prevent infection or spread of Covid-19, let’s find out if they prevent hospitalisations like the authorities claim.  According to table 16 of the report between the 28th August 2021 and the 3rd September 2021 there were 36 admissions to hospital related to Covid-19 among the unvaccinated over 60 population, whilst there were 7 admissions on the partly vaccinated population.  However, there were a huge 299 admissions among the fully vaccinated over 60 population, and the same pattern can be seen for the weeks previous all the way back to the 7th August 2021.  In all for the week of 28th August to 3rd September 2021 there were 271 hospitalisations among the entire unvaccinated population but 423 hospitalisations among the fully vaccinated population. If we base these hospitalisations occurring after the previous weeks confirmed cases then we can calculate the case-hospitalisation rate.  In the week beginning 21st August there were 15,047 confirmed cases among the unvaccinated population. Therefore based on the unvaccinated hospitalisation figures of 271 in the week beginning 28th August the case-hospitalisation rate is 1.7%. However, when we carry out the same calculation for the fully vaccinated population hospitalisations (423) and cases (14,519) we can see that the case-hospitalisation rate is 2.9%.  Therefore, this shows that the Covid-19 injections are increasing the risk of hospitalisation when exposed to Covid-19 by 70% rather than reducing the risk by the 95% claimed by the vaccine manufacturers and authorities.  So now that we’ve cleared up the Covid-19 injections increase the risk of hospitalisation rather than reducing it let’s find out if they prevent deaths like the authorities claim.  Table 17 of the Public Health Scotland report shows the number of deaths to have occurred via vaccination status. However, PHS have been very clever in the way they’ve presented the number of deaths. Because rather than present them on a week by week basis like they have with the number of cases and hospitalisations, they’ve instead included deaths all the way back to the 29th December.  This means they are including deaths from the height of the alleged second wave of Covid-19 where just 9% of the population had received a single dose, and just 0.1% of the entire population were fully vaccinated. Therefore, PHS are very sneakily able to give the impression that the majority of Covid-19 deaths are occurring among the unvaccinated population.  The above table is taken from the report released by Public Health Scotland on the 18th August 2021 and shows deaths due to Covid-19 by vaccination status between the 29th December 2020 and the 5th August 2021. As you can see anyone reading the report would be given the impression that the vaccines are doing a fantastic job at preventing death due to Covid-19.  But fast forward to the most recent report and you will find on Table 17 that there have been 3,102 deaths among the unvaccinated population, 279 deaths among the partly vaccinated population and 298 deaths among the fully vaccinated population between the 29th December and the 26th August 2021.  Therefore, the true number of deaths by vaccination status between the 5th August 2021 and the 26th August 2021 are as follows –  Unvaccinated population – 25 deaths  Partly vaccinated population – 6 deaths  Fully vaccinated population – 92 deaths  This means the unvaccinated population have accounted for just 20% of alleged Covid-19 deaths throughout the whole of August, whilst the fully vaccinated accounted for 75% of them. But couple the partly vaccinated deaths with the fully vaccinated deaths and you can see that throughout August 80% of deaths occurred among the vaccinated population.  However this makes it hard to work out the case-fatality rate so to do this we need to look at how many deaths occurred in the previous weeks report. Up to the 19th August there had been 3,096 deaths among the unvaccinated, 277 deaths among the partly vaccinated, and 264 deaths among the fully vaccinated.  Therefore, the true number of deaths by vaccination status between the 19th August 2021 and the 26th August 2021 are as follows –  Unvaccinated population – 6 deaths  Partly vaccinated population – 2 deaths  Fully vaccinated population – 34 deaths  If we base these deaths on occurring two weeks after the number of confirmed cases then we can work out the case-fatality rate.  In the week beginning 7th August there were 3,788 confirmed cases among the fully vaccinated population. Therefore based on the unvaccinated death figures of 6 in the week beginning 19th August the case-fatality rate is 0.15%. However, when we carry out the same calculation for the fully vaccinated population hospitalisations (34) and cases (3,490) we can see that the case-hospitalisation rate is 1%.  Therefore, this shows that the Covid-19 injections are increasing the risk of death when exposed to Covid-19 by a huge 566% rather than reducing the risk by the 95% claimed by the vaccine manufacturers and authorities.  What’s even more concerning about this is that the number of confirmed cases among the fully vaccinated population have rose significantly in the most recent week compared to four weeks prior. Therefore the number of hospitalisations and deaths that could occur in the next few weeks could possibly be enough for the authorities to justify another lockdown.  The data clearly shows the jabs do not prevent infection or transmission, and it clearly shows that they are increasing the risk of hospitalisation and death rather than reducing the risk.

c9c6869b,"Washington – U.S. Congressman David Cicilline D-RI, who has co-sponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act in the House, today called on House Republicans to help close the wage gap that still exists between women and men in the workforce.  “Nearly a century since suffrage was achieved, women continue to lag behind men in terms of compensation in the workplace. It is unacceptable that women continue to earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men in the same position. In many families, women have grown increasingly responsible for household income, and we must work to ensure that their pay keeps pace with their participation in the job market,” said Cicilline.  In January 2009, the Democratic-led 111th Congress sent to the President’s desk the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act – and it became the first bill signed into law by President Obama. This Act, a great victory for women, restores the right of women to challenge unfair pay in court – but virtually all House Republicans rejected this critical measure for women. Cicilline, who was sworn into office in January 2011, has continued to press for additional measures to protect equal pay for women.  “While the Lilly Ledbetter Act marked a significant achievement there is still more work to be done. I am a proud cosponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would enhance the remedies available under the Equal Pay Act to better to better equip women fighting against wage discrimination. Although the House Republican leadership has failed to consider this measure, I will continue to stand up with the other members of our state’s delegation to promote progress for Rhode Island women and their families,” added Cicilline.  This year, Equal Pay Day also falls on Tax Day. Just as Cicilline is fighting to achieve equal pay for women in the workforce, he is also fighting for basic fairness in the tax code. While women are struggling in the workplace with unfair pay, it adds insult to injury that many workers with modest incomes are actually paying a higher tax rate than their well-paid bosses. That is why Congressman Cicilline, who authored a letter to Speaker Boehner last week urging the House to enact a “Buffett Rule,” today reiterated the importance of ensuring that multimillion dollar earners no longer pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than middle class Rhode Island families.",Cicilline Marks Equal Pay Day By Stressing Importance of Closing Wage Gap Between Women and Men,mixture,
ae29f720,"WASHINGTON – Howard University is pleased to announce a $4 million gift from the Hopper-Dean Foundation to fund the Bison STEM Scholars Program (BSSP). The generous gift will provide 10 computer science or computer engineering students with a full-ride scholarship for four years. In addition to eliminating the financial burden for students, the gift will support the expansion of Howard’s STEM education program. The gift marks Howard’s largest gift received from a foundation to date. “The Hopper-Dean donation will make a life-altering difference in the lives of our students and we appreciate their investment and confidence in the University. This generous gift will further enhance Howard’s strategic plan and University mission to diversify the workforce with skillfully trained students who are prepared to focus on careers in computer science and computer engineering,” says President Wayne A. I. Frederick. “We have made significant progress over the last three years through the Bison STEM Program to change the landscape of what STEM Ph.D.s look like. This significant financial contribution by the Hopper-Dean Foundation speaks volumes to the caliber of the program and the student success achieved thus far.” In 2017, under the leadership and vision of President Frederick, Howard University launched BSSP to increase the number of underrepresented minority students who earn a Ph.D. or M.D.-Ph.D. in a STEM discipline. Each student has gone through a rigorous interview process and was hand-selected among the best and brightest scholars in the nation. The Hopper-Dean Foundation, a California nonprofit supported by Jeffrey Dean and Heidi Hopper, is partnering with Howard to address racial and gender disparity in STEM fields by removing the socioeconomic barriers to pursuing Ph.D.s and other advanced research degrees. The Hopper-Dean Bison STEM Scholars will receive a scholarship that covers 100 percent of the tuition and fees associated with attending the University and participating in the program. “As the importance of computing and computer science continues to grow, we truly believe the population of computer scientists should reflect that growth in terms of diversity,” said Jeffrey Dean and Heidi Hopper. “This gift to Howard University is designed to support Howard’s robust STEM education program and help expand its reach in the future.” In addition to student scholarships, the gift includes $1 million designated to the President’s Innovation Fund to support future programs and initiatives related to STEM education. “This generous contribution will allow the Bison STEM Scholars Program to continue providing minority students with a rigorous and supportive opportunity in STEM education. By participating in our program, these emerging scholars will be some of the most well-prepared candidates for graduate or professional degrees amongst their peers,” said Ron H. Smith, program director for the Bison STEM Scholars Program. “We look forward to growing our capacity to serve more students interested in pursuing professional careers in STEM with the support of this gift.” Each year, the program accepts a cohort of 30 scholars enrolled in programs within the College of Engineering and Architecture and the College of Arts and Sciences. In addition to maintaining a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.30 each semester, Bison STEM scholars are required to meet with a professional mentor, participate in summer research internships, study abroad and complete the summer bridge program for incoming freshmen. Upon graduation, the scholars will pursue careers in research, policy development or leadership roles related to STEM.

650bd80f,"When charges of “racism” and “xenophobia” fail, Democrats’ fallback argument against President Trump’s proposed border wall is that it simply “won’t work,” so why waste billions building it? Tell that to the residents of El Paso, Texas. Federal data show a far-less imposing wall than the one Trump envisions — a two-story corrugated metal fence first erected under the Bush administration — already has dramatically curtailed both illegal border crossings and crime in Texas’ sixth-largest city, which borders the high-crime Mexican city of Juarez. In fact, the number of deportable illegal immigrants located by the US Border Patrol plummeted by more than 89 percent over the five-year period during which the controversial new fence was built, according to Homeland Security data I reviewed. When the project first started in 2006, illegal crossings totaled 122,261, but by 2010, when the 131-mile fence was completed from one end of El Paso out into the New Mexico desert, immigrant crossings shrank to just 12,251. They hit a low of 9,678 in 2012, before slowly ticking back up to a total of 25,193 last year. But they’re still well below pre-fence levels, and the Border Patrol credits the fortified barrier dividing El Paso from Mexico for the reduction in illegal flows. And crime abated with the reduced human traffic from Juarez, considered one of the most dangerous places in the world due to drug-cartel violence, helping El Paso become one of the safest large cities in America. Before 2010, federal data show the border city was mired in violent crime and drug smuggling, thanks in large part to illicit activities spilling over from the Mexican side. Once the fence went up, however, things changed almost overnight. El Paso since then has consistently topped rankings for cities of 500,000 residents or more with low crime rates, based on FBI-collected statistics. The turnaround even caught the attention of former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and other Obama administration officials, who touted it as one of the nation’s safest cities while citing the beefed-up border security there. Federal data illustrates just how remarkable the turnaround in crime has been since the fence was built. According to FBI tables, property crimes in El Paso have plunged more than 37 percent to 12,357 from their pre-fence peak of 19,702 a year, while violent crimes have dropped more than 6 percent to 2,682 from a peak of 2,861 a year. The overall crime rate in El Paso continued to fall last year, prompting city leaders to trumpet the good news in a press release that noted, “Because El Paso is a border town, its low crime rate may surprise you.” Since the fence was completed, the volume of marijuana and cocaine coming through El Paso and seized by Border Patrol agents has been cut in half El Paso City Manager Tommy Gonzalez boasted that the city will “continue to lead our country in public safety.” Another core promise made by Trump to justify constructing a massive wall spanning from Texas to California is that it will slow the flow of drugs coming across the border from Mexico. “We need the wall for security. We need the wall for safety,” Trump said last week while answering questions about the sweeping new GOP immigration bill. “We need the wall for stopping the drugs from pouring in.” On that score, El Paso already has exceeded expectations. Drug smuggling along that border entry point has also fallen dramatically. In fact, since the fence was completed, the volume of marijuana and cocaine coming through El Paso and seized by Border Patrol agents has been cut in half. The year before the wall was fully built in 2010, the volume of illegal drugs confiscated by the feds along the El Paso border hit 87,725 pounds. The year after, the amount of drug seizures plummeted to 43,783 pounds. Last year, they dropped even further to a total of 34,329, according to Border Patrol reports obtained by The Post. All told, a legion of empirical evidence supports the idea a southern border wall could, in fact, work. There is also anecdotal evidence. In local press accounts, El Paso residents and business owners alike have praised the fence, citing it as an effective deterrent to both illegal crossings and crime. see also Border Patrol busts drop to 46-year low Arrests by Border Patrol agents dropped to a 46-year low... Now Trump plans to build a possibly bigger deterrent. The existing fence along the El Paso sector, which is made of a combination of corrugated steel and metal meshing, towers 21-feet high at some points and is already hard to climb. But the Trump wall, which will begin construction in El Paso, will be even taller and have multiple layers of security. Still, Democratic leaders are adamantly opposed to it. They argue the $18 billion wall won’t work to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs, and will only be a massive waste of tax dollars. “We think, frankly, the building of the wall, its cost is not justified either by its efficiency or effectiveness,” House Minority Whip Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said Thursday. Even local Democrats are arguing with success. “That wall in itself is a racist reaction to a racist myth that does not reflect the reality of this country at all,” said Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-El Paso).

Fifty years ago, I was a little girl who got scolded by a teacher for speaking Spanish during recess. I also know that those sentiments are not indicative of who we are as San Antonians.  That's why I'm hopeful the San Antonio City Council will pass updates to the city code ensuring that the city, and those who contract with the city, will not discriminate against their employees because of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or veterans' status. These common-sense updates also ensure fair treatment in housing and public accommodations and will bring San Antonio in line with the codes of cities such as Dallas, Fort Worth, and Austin. But, they'll also make sure our city's laws reflect our city's values.  I was fortunate, in an age when women weren't always allowed the same opportunities as men, to have parents who convinced me that I could do anything. As an educator, my mother pushed me academically. And, whenever people would comment to my father that I was pretty, he would reply, “She's the smartest in her class.” These are values our city should promote — ensuring equal access to opportunities based on dedication and talent, not on who we love or who we are.  With respect to those who have come before us, we know that change is constant. The image of Texas is of cowboys — vaqueros — fighting to tame a wild frontier. But now we have a 21st century powerhouse economy. Our small-town past steadily changed into a high-rise present — and today, six of the 20 largest cities in the United States are right here in Texas.  We'll continue to change — I believe for the better. I can't think of any better time in history to be living in Texas than right now. Texans have always boasted that this is a land of opportunity, and this has never been truer than today.  As chairwoman of the Senate Veteran Affairs and Military Installations Committee, I was blessed to meet Staff Sergeant Eric Alva. In 2003, this San Antonio native became the first Marine to be seriously injured in the Iraq War, when he stepped on a land mine and lost his right leg.  He fought for us. He fought for you. He very nearly died for our country, and still suffers for it every day. And yet, here in his home state and his home city, he can be denied or fired from a job just because he is gay. It's not right that a man who fought to protect this country is not protected at home — that a man who loves his country is discriminated against because of who he loves.  Updating the city's non-discrimination ordinance acknowledges the importance of ensuring that all members of our community are treated with fairness and dignity. Together we can make this possible, together we will erase harmful inequalities that threaten our city's quality of life.  Thankfully, I will not have to stand alone, because San Antonians are with us. We all know and respect people like Eric.",City Council should pass human-rights ordinance,mixture,
,"Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said 10 ambassadors, including those from the US and France, were ""persona non grata"" after they issued a statement in support of a jailed activist.  Osman Kavala, 64, is a Turkish businessman, publisher and activist who has been detained for more than four years despite having never been convicted of a crime.  He was acquitted last year in connection to nationwide protests in 2013, but then rearrested in connection with the attempted military coup in 2016.  A joint statement calling for Mr Kavala's release was jointly issued this week by the US, France, Germany, Canada, Finland, Denmark, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden.  ""The continuing delays in his trial, including by merging different cases and creating new ones after a previous acquittal, cast a shadow over respect for democracy, the rule of law and transparency in the Turkish judiciary system,"" the statement read.  Advertisement  The embassies of its signatories called for a ""just and speedy resolution to his case... in line with Turkey's international obligations and domestic laws"".  ""Noting the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights on the matter, we call for Turkey to secure his urgent release,"" it added.  Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:06 Erdogan vows traitor crackdown after failed coup  The ECHR called for Mr Kavala's immediate release two years ago, finding that there was no reasonable suspicion that he had committed an offence and accusing Turkey of detaining him for the purpose of silencing him.  The Council of Europe, the 47-member human rights body which drafted and now upholds the European Convention of Human Rights, said it would begin infringement proceedings against Turkey if Mr Kavala wasn't released.  In response to the joint statement, President Erdogan told a crowd on Saturday that the foreign ambassadors ""cannot dare to come to the Turkish foreign ministry and give orders"".  He said: ""I gave the necessary order to our foreign minister and said what must be done. These 10 ambassadors must be declared persona non grata at once. You will sort it out immediately.

,"An FBI SWAT team raided the home of an activist mother of four in Colorado on Tuesday, Nov. 16, knocking down her door, bursting into the house with guns and handcuffing her while she was homeschooling her children. This is the first known case of the federal government making good on its promise to not only intimidate but actually carry out a raid on a mom who was involved in her local school board politics, said Brannon Howse, who interviewed Sherronna Bishop at Lindell TV Wednesday night. The U.S. Department of Justice and Attorney General Merrick Garland issued an Oct. 4 memorandum directing federal, state and local law enforcement to look for parents to prosecute nationwide who may have made “threats” and made “harassing” phone calls to school board members nationwide, equating such parents to domestic terrorists. Now a mother, Sherronna Bishop of Grand Junction, Colorado, has felt the brute force of the FBI’s heavily armed SWAT unit used against her family. Sherronna Bishop has been active in school board politics throughout Colorado and operates a website that helps educate parents nationwide about their children’s education. She was at home with her three children about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday when she heard someone pounding on the front door, then using a battering ram to break it down. She said the officers “manhandled” her 18-year-old daughter, pulling her up the stairs by her hoodie, while another officer put her in handcuffs and ushered her out of the house. They proceeded to search the entire house. UPDATE AS OF NOV. 19: The FBI has filed no charges against Bishop. Three of Bishop’s four children, ages 8, 10 and 18, were home at the time of the raid, as was her husband, who was also handcuffed. Her 17-year-old son was at his high school. Besides being a frequent attendee at her local school board meetings, Bishop has also been active in the voter integrity movement in her state and locality. She runs the website Americasmom.net, and on that site she features an article and video under the title We the Parents: How Did We Get Here? She said she has not been guilty of anything but speaking her mind in accordance with her First Amendment rights. “This is still the United States of America, where we are able to state what we think and we believe,” she told Howse. “There was some pounding on my door. I didn’t really know what to think, I thought at first it might be some neighbor kids. They were pounding profusely, and then it hit me it was the FBI. I took my kids to their bedrooms. They used a battering ram to bash down my door, they cuffed me. And then proceeded to search and go through my whole home.” She said the agents would not tell her why they were searching her home. They did leave behind documents related to the search warrant, saying they entered her home because she was suspected of causing “intentional damage to a protected computer, wire fraud and conspiracy to cause damage to a protected computer.” “I don’t know anything about this. They couldn’t explain any of this,” she said. “I will tell you why: they were at my home to intimidate me, to shut me up, because I was using my First Amendment rights to advocate for [Mesa County Clerk] Tina Peters on the issue of Dominion [voting machines] and the damage done in our election. And they’ll never be held accountable. Instead they will criminalize this woman who has stood up.” “I know people will say, well Sherronna, why don’t you just shut your mouth… That’s exactly what they hope you will do. I can open my mouth and say whatever I want to say and that is not a criminal action. This is about their desire to shut you down and stop you from saying it.” “I’m a law abiding citizen, I’m very supportive of law enforcement,” she continued. “I love the Constitution. And what happened yesterday, what happened is something I never imagined I would experience in America.” Bishop said she uses her website, AmericasMom.net, to educate and inform parents and moms regarding their children’s education. “And since then we’ve gotten involved in school board races. I love my state. I’m a fourth generation Coloradan. Most recently I’ve been a very vocal advocate of a candidate [Peters]… She’s had to fight for her own life, and a guess now I’ll have to fight for mine.” Bishop has been part of a group of parents that have been successful in fighting the teaching of critical race theory and school mask mandates. “Colorado was able to flip nine school boards this year. We were able to get one of our leftists to resign and we also flipped our school board in the election,” Bishop said. “And people like me are considered domestic terrorists now, because we don’t stand for the policies that have been forced upon our children.” Howse said history will be kind to Bishop. “I believe you will go down in history as the first mom targeted [by the FBI]. The FBI has said it plans to do this and I believe you are the first mom to have this done to you. Mask mandates, opposing critical race theory, election theft, which Biden said if you question that you are involved in subversion. But I believe you are the first mom to have been targeted and had your door literally busted down while you were homeschooling your kids.” Bishop said she has always made a point of being transparent. “I have always made myself available, I’ve never tried to hide from anything and now for them to bash my door down, manhandle my daughter… I think the timing is really interesting, because we don’t want people to be silent because of what happened to me. If anything I want people to be more vocal,… because this is still America and you still have the right to stand up for yourself and your family.” “I believe elections have consequences, and in this case this illegitimate regime is having serious consequences for all of America.” Howse asked if she ever thought she would be targeted in this way by her own government. “No I never thought in America that a suburban housewife and mom would have her door bashed in by the FBI,” she said. He asked about her three children. “My kids are very resilient. And part of schooling them has been to teach them the proper role of government and the proper role of law enforcement and I can’t convince them now that the FBI are good guys. And I really have my own doubts about that now. You cannot just say ‘I followed orders’ to go bash someone’s door down. They are responsible for what they are doing.” Howse had just concluded a series of interviews with a panel of four retired FBI agents just days before the raid in which they had described similar raids against non-violent patriotic Americans over the last few years, starting with Gen. Michael Flynn in 2016, followed by the pre-dawn raid on author and Trump ally Roger Stone in 2019 and then the violent entering of journalist James O’Keefe of Project Veritas just last week. “I was on the [FBI] SWAT team for several years,” said Brian Shepard, appearing with three other retired FBI agents at a symposium aired by WVW TV on Nov. 16. “And I can tell you from my experience, and I think all others of the bureau agents here would echo what I’m going to say. We never conducted a search or conducted an arrest of someone who was not a violent offender. And the thought when I heard about what happened with Roger Stone, just outraged me so much that, it just rose up inside me.” Now, an activist mom has been targeted, raising the question: Has the FBI become the political shock troops for the White House, seeking to harass and intimidate anyone who speaks out against its policies? Howse said it was obvious that Shepard became emotional when he began talking about how the bureau, he gave the better part of his life to serve, had now taken to bashing down the doors of non-violent American patriots. “Brian’s reaction is very typical of men in that generation who served in the FBI, and many of those men have responded the same way, because they gave the best years of their lives to the agency, and upheld what they believed were the values of the agency, bravery, integrity and fidelity, and they become emotional when they saw how this has been discarded. They are beside themselves. It happened to others and now it happens to you, within days of our filming [of the panel].” Bishop said the timing was not lost on her. “I can’t explain it. I can’t explain being a target, for an agency that typically takes down the cartel, human trafficking, and now I’ve had my children traumatized and if this can happen to me, they’ll come for you too.” “I made myself completely transparent to them and yet they chose to break down my door, terrorize my kids and try to intimidate me.” She said the agents took her phone and other devices and kept her handcuffed for at least 30 minutes. “No, I never had any access to any voting machines. They know I am just a voice, an advocate. We must have been effective. I know the people here, they’re not going to back down, and we’re not going to stop. In times past they never would have moved forward on this, but the narrative in America right now is one that is pushing a progressive narrative of communism. Now you can stay in your home and talk about it privately but you dare not come out and talk about it publicly …or they will send the FBI to your door because according to this regime you are a domestic terrorist. “We’ve got to stick together and we can’t let these thugs put us into fear and intimidation.” Howse said he was shocked by the news of Bishop’s experience. “I could see them moving against someone like me, or Mike Lindell. It is hard to see them coming after someone like you, to come after a mom, who is working at the school board level and the election level, and to bust your door down? This is totally unprecedented by the agency in how they conducted themselves. So even for someone who has studied communism and a color revolution, the way they are doing it and the pace at which they’re doing it, I never anticipated it to move this fast.”","It Begins: FBI raids house, terrorizes family of mom who protested local school board, elections",mixture,174807144234208790524871622651097169360

ccfaeb64,"Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 — a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month. Even though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline. Enrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas. In Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida’s request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017. A spokesperson for Florida’s Department of Children and Families (DCF) — the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida — confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program. “The dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the state’s administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,” said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims. Sims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3. The sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters. But it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce. The Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures — such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week — and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further. Over the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year — and every year after 2013 — is continuing.",Scientists caught 'adjusting' sea level data to create false impression of rising oceans,mixture,
9f4d9fd2,"Aung San Suu Kyi Residence Rangoon, Burma 12:35 P.M. MMT DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI: I'm sorry if we've kept you waiting. Let me just begin by saying what a great pleasure it is for me to welcome President Obama again to my house and to be able to meet all of you. I would just like to say that there have been those who have been saying that there is tension between the United States and the National League for Democracy or perhaps with me. I would like to make it quite clear that the friendship between the United States and those who have been struggling for democracy in Burma is a very strong one. We may view things differently from time to time but it will in no way affect our friendship. And I have absolute confidence that the United States will continue to support us with regard to the democratic transformation and that when Burma becomes a fully functioning democracy in accordance with the will of the people, we will be able to say that among those friends who enabled us to get there, the United States was among the first. So please don't think -- please don't worry that there will be any problems between the United States and those working for democracy in Burma. We all believe in the same values. We all believe in the same principles. We may sometimes think that there are different ways of getting to the goal that we wish to achieve, but these differences are part of the democratic tradition. Democracy allows people to have different views, and democracy makes it also -- makes us also responsible for negotiating an answer for those views. I would like all of you to feel welcome in this country, and I would like all of you to feel that you can join us in hoping for better days. But at the same time, I always warn against over-optimism because that could lead to complacency. Our reform process is going through, let’s just say, a bumpy patch. But this bumpy patch is something that we can negotiate with commitment and with the help and understanding of our friends from all over the world. So let us not exaggerate the differences and the difficulties. But at the same time, let us not exaggerate the rosy picture either. What we need is a healthy balance between optimism and pessimism. We need to view the situation for what it was. But at the same time, we all have to be confident that we will get there -- we will get where we want to get to, because that’s what our people want. In the end, it’s the people of Burma who will decide where this country is going to and which way and how and when. So we accept responsibility for the state of our country, but at the same time we welcome the support and the help of our friends. And we always appreciate them very greatly. Thank you. PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, good afternoon, everybody. Mingalaba. It is wonderful to be back in Rangoon and to once more have the opportunity to spend time with Aung San Suu Kyi. As we know, it was in this house that she endured years of confinement -- never giving up hope, never wavering in her determination to build a free and democratic Burma. Daw Suu, you helped set this country on a better path. I’m grateful for your friendship and for the hospitality that you’ve shown in opening your home up not only to me, but to all these people. When I made my first historic visit to Burma, this country was just taking preliminary steps towards democracy. And in the past two years, important changes have been made. The economy has begun to grow. Political prisoners have been set free. There are more newspapers and media outlets. Children have been released from the military. And these are all important changes that have opened up greater opportunity for the people of Burma. At the same time, as Aung San Suu Kyi just said, it’s clear how much hard work remains to be done and that many difficult choices still lie ahead. The process for reform is by no means complete or irreversible. For many, progress has not come fast enough or spread far enough. People need to feel safe in their homes and not be subject to arbitrary harassment by authorities or individuals acting with impunity. People need to be empowered to pursue their dreams. And as Burma approaches important national elections next year, it will be critical to ensure that all of Burma’s people can participate in shaping the future of their country. As a member of parliament and the head of the rule of law committee, Aung San Suu Kyi is working hard to make government more transparent, more accountable, to protect the rights of all the Burmese people, to promote reforms that would expand the political space for more people to contribute their voices. But implementing the major political and economic reforms that are necessary to keep Burma advancing toward democracy is going to take a great deal of political will and no small amount of determination. And we, as friends of the Burmese people, are clear-eyed about the scale of the challenges that remain, and recognize that we cannot remain complacent. Today, Daw Suu and I had a wide-ranging discussion about how the United States can help facilitate and bolster Burma’s democratic transition. We talked about the need for stronger rule of law, for elections that are free, fair and inclusive, and for continued constitutional changes that will move Burma more fully towards a civilian government. We spoke about how we can work together to promote national reconciliation and defuse sectarian tensions among Burma’s diverse ethnic groups. Specifically, I stressed the need to find durable and effective solutions for the terrible violence in Rakhine state -- solutions that end discrimination, provide greater security and economic opportunities, protect all citizens, and promote greater tolerance and understanding. Strengthening human rights protections for all of Burma’s people is an essential step to realizing the vision we share for the future of this beautiful country. The last time I stood here, I made a pledge to the people of Burma -- that if we continued to see progress toward reform, the ties between our countries would grow stronger, and the United States would continue to do whatever it could to help ensure Burma’s success. Over the last two years, I think we’ve made good on that pledge, and I want to reiterate the commitment to match continued reforms with greater support and friendships in the future. We’re committed to working directly with the people of Burma, and not just the government. So later today, I’m looking forward to speaking with representatives of Burma’s civil society groups and with young leaders from Burma and all across Southeast Asia who are working to create greater opportunities for themselves and for future generations. I think these new voices are going to be critical to making sure that reforms are sustainable and meaningful to people across the country and across the region. So, Daw Suu, thank you again for welcoming us here today. We continue to look to you for inspiration as well as resolve, and I know that you will continue to be a fierce advocate on behalf of the people of Burma, a future of democracy, and I know that you will be a strong partner with the United States. Thank you. Questions? DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI: Who’s speaking? PRESIDENT OBAMA: I’ll go first. Christi Parsons. Q You have been traveling in countries with long histories of repressing freedom of expression and censorship. And it was interesting yesterday that President Xi seemed to be saying that reporters who have problems have themselves to blame. And so I wonder to what extent you feel the need to contend with these ideas with leaders in this region as you travel. And what do you say to them? And by way of example, I might ask you -- Attorney General Eric Holder says no journalist will go to prison for doing his or her job, on his watch.And so I ask about the case of James Risen, the journalist who is facing this prosecution for not revealing his source in a leak prosecution. I wonder if that’s -- are you speaking specifically about this case, and is that your position as well? And if I may, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, ask you -- how concerned are you about the violence against ethnic minorities in your country, and specifically the Rohingya people? And what do you believe is your responsibility to speak out about it? Thank you very much. PRESIDENT OBAMA: The issue of press freedom is a constant concern in my interactions with the Chinese government. It’s an issue that I’ve raised with the President here in Burma. I’m pretty blunt and pretty frank about the fact that societies that repress journalists ultimately oppress people as well, and that if you want a society that is free and vibrant and successful, part of that formula is the free flow of information, of ideas, and that requires a free press. That is part of our tradition. As I explained to President Xi in China, it’s in our DNA. We believe in the primacy individuals being able to pursue their dreams, endowed with certain inalienable rights. And we believe that when governments censor or control information, that ultimately that undermines not only the society, but it leads to eventual encroachments on individual rights as well. I can't comment, Christi, on any particular pending case, as you know -- that's sort of an iron-clad rule -- or any particular prosecution. I can read back to you what Attorney General Holder has said, which is no journalist is going to go to jail for doing their job. And I don't think you're suggesting that there's -- that the two cases are comparable. But I recognize that in our own society we have to constantly balance the need for certain national security issues to remain secret with journalists pursuing leads wherever they can. And the good news is, is that we've got courts and we've got a First Amendment. And we got a whole bunch of tools to ensure that that balance is properly debated and adjudicated. But I think that when I am traveling, it is important as the President of the United States to not just talk about our interests, but also to talk about our values. Sometimes it has an impact; sometimes it doesn't. Although I was impressed that Mark Landler got an answer to his question from President Xi. It might not have been the one he was expecting, but he did end up taking the question. So you just keep on chipping away and seeing if we can make progress. Q (Off-mic.) PRESIDENT OBAMA: Hold on a second, Christi. Don't try to segue into a second question. DAW AUNG SAN SUI KYI: I think I better take over (inaudible) my time as well. PRESIDENT OBAMA: There you go. DAW AUNG SAN SUI KYI: The National League for Democracy always has been against violence of any kind, either on the racial grounds, or religious grounds, or ideological grounds. We do not believe that violence really results in (inaudible). Our struggle for democracy has been carried out with a strong grasp on the principle of nonviolence. And also, we believe in the rule of law. So if you ask how do we propose to resolve all of these problems of violence between communities, between different ethnic groups, we've got to start with rule of law. People have to feel secure before they can start talking to one another. We cannot achieve harmony without security. People who feel threatened are not going to sit down and sort out their problems. So I would like to recommend, as the chair of the Rule of Law and Tranquility Committee -- don't forget that tranquility is also included -- that the government should look to rule of law. It is the duty of the government to make all our people feel secure, and it is the duty of our people to learn to live in harmony with one another. If we want democracy, we have to be prepared to live by the principles of democracy. We have to dare to live according to the principles of democracy. I think we'll get there, but it will take us some time. But we will remain fully committed to the principle of nonviolence. Q Mr. President, I'd like to know about the Myanmar reforms. You've been talking with the President and parliament speakers, and also you're going to talk with the civil societies group, and then youth. So my question to you is that: Have you got any specific agreement with the Myanmar government or President Thein Sein about Myanmar reforms such as constitutional change, and peace negotiation, peace process, and also 2015 general election? And also to Daw Aung San Sui Kyi, you've got a one-hour discussion with the President, and at the current (inaudible), as you said, it’s a bumpy situation. So if you didn't make amendment, or you didn't change constitution, the NLD and you, yourself, is going to be very difficult after 2015 elections. So have you talked about those issues with the President? Or the President talk to you about U.S. support for you? Thank you. PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, the issue of making sure that reforms and the transition is fully realized was the main topic of our conversation and the main topic of my conversation with the President last night. As I indicated before, there are signs of progress. We shouldn't deny that Burma today is not the same as Burma five years ago. But the process is still incomplete. And I was very specific with the President in terms of how we will measure whether or not the transition has been fully realized. Number one, we expect elections to take place on time. We do not want to see delays, because it's time for the voice of the people of Burma to be heard in a fair, free, transparent election. Number two, I indicated to the President that the constitution amendment process needs to reflect inclusion rather than exclusion, that there are certain provisions in the Burmese constitution that objectively don't make much sense. Ultimately, what changes are made are up to the people of Burma. But, for example, I don't understand a provision that would bar somebody from running for President because of who their children are. That doesn't make much sense to me. Number three, we are very much in favor of the peace process, and I encourage the President to move forward in the negotiations. He expressed some optimism about the ability to bring a deal to a conclusion. But as Daw Suu has indicated, you have to be skeptical until it's actually done. Number four, I indicated that we are paying attention to how religious minorities are treated in this country. Now, I recognize the complexities of the situation in Rakhine state. On the other hand, consistent with what Daw Suu just said, I am a firm believer that any legitimate government has to be based on rule of law and a recognition that all people are equal under the law. And discrimination against the Rohingya or any other religious minority I think does not express the kind of country that Burma over the long term wants to be. And I know of no successful democracy in which sectarian or religious divisions are allowed to fester, or the people of different faiths are treated as second-class citizens. Ultimately, that is destabilizing to a democracy. And finally, I expressed to the President the need to continue to make additional progress on basic issues of freedom and personal security, that journalists can't be jailed simply because they were critical of the government; that arbitrary arrests or individuals being in some fashion abused by government with impunity rather than being respected and treated in accordance with law, that that's a test of whether or not a society is moving towards a genuine democratic process. And the President yesterday acknowledged that some progress has been made, and there was more to do. And our position will be to continue to measure what's happening on the ground, to consult with a wide range of groups here in Burma. We will strengthen our relationship where we see progress. Where we dn see progress. Where we don’t see progress, then we will continue to express our concerns, and we will not be able to fully realize the kind of bilateral relationship that we want to have with Burma, the Burmese government, until we’ve seen some of these reforms completed. DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI: You asked whether (inaudible) NLD to win the elections if the amendments to the constitution are not pushed through. I think it’s too early to ask this question. We’ve just spent one afternoon debating the question of constitutional amendment. I think perhaps some of you may have heard that proportional representation is not going to be instituted. So when we started defending (inaudible) against proportional representation, there were many who said to us, you are a very small minority in the legislature; how can you hope to win this case? It’s not a matter of wanting to win a case, it’s a matter of standing up for what you believe in, for what you believe is necessary for the future of our country. Now we are asking for a constitutional amendment not because we’re trying to win a case, but because we think that certain amendments are necessary if this country is to be a truly functioning democracy in line with the will of the people. Because of that, we will persist in our efforts to have the constitution amended in the right way and within the framework of the law. I’ve always put great emphasis on this because I want peace and tranquility in our country. I want our people to learn to live under the rule of law, and to support and uphold the importance of the rule of law. So with regard to the constitution, we know that the people support our wish to amend it in certain ways, and we are prepared to negotiate with those who do not wish to amend the constitution. I think that’s what democracy is all about. We need a culture of negotiated compromise as the foundation for our democratic union. So we would like to -- it’s not just a matter of debating the case in parliament and winning Brownie points or Boy Scout points, or whatever they’re called. But it’s just a case of standing up for what we think our country needs. And we would like to talk to those who disagree with us. That, again, is what democracy is about. You talk to those who disagree with you; you don’t beat them down. You exchange views. And you come to a compromise, a settlement that would be best for the country. I’ve always said that dialogues and debates are not aimed at achieving victory for one particular party or the other, but victory for our people as a whole. Whatever we decide on should be seen as a victory for our nation, for the kind of democratic union that we have been trying to build up for decades. So please don’t worry about whether or not we will win the elections in 2015. Of course, any party wants to win the elections. I’m sure the President will tell you that. (Laughter.) But winning is not everything -- it’s how you win. I’d rather lose than win in the wrong way. And that is the way I want our party and our people to approach the problems that we have to tackle -- that we want to win in the right way. We want to bring the changes of the constitution about in the right way. We want to build up a strong foundation for national reconciliation, which means reconciliation not just between the different ethnic groups and between different religious groups, but between different ideas -- for example, between the idea of military supremacy and the idea of civilian authority over the military, which is the foundation of democracy. So we want to exchange views and to come to an understanding with all those who at this moment do not yet agree with us. And we are confident that we can come to such a settlement, come to such an agreement because, after all, I do believe that what all of us want is what is best for the country as a whole -- not just for particular individuals or groups or organizations. So while I tell you that you need not worry about what affects amendment or non-amendment to the constitution might have on the elections, I might as well ask you to vote for us when we do get there. PRESIDENT OBAMA: Pete Maer. Q Mr. President, it seems the stage is set for even more confrontations between you and Republicans when you get home, if that’s possible. We’re told that you’re soon going to sign the immigration reform executive order. To what extent are you concerned about a Republican backlash from an action of that magnitude? And on two other issues, I’m wondering what your take is on the plan to pass a bill to build the Keystone pipeline that’s in the works now, before the State Department’s review process is over. And Senator McConnell is angry over the climate deal that you had made with China. How does all of this square with your post-election assessment that people want to, as you put it, get stuff done? And if I may also pose a question to you, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Thank you for hosting all of us here from the White House media corps. As the President mentioned of the constitutional barring of you running in your country’s election, what do you think the impact will be from the President’s statement that was made here today on his strong opposition to that constitutional wording? And what impact do you think it will have on the government here? And is there anything more that you’d like to see him do? Thank you. PRESIDENT OBAMA: Pete, the day after the election I said that there are going to be areas of agreement between me and Republicans, and there are going to be areas of disagreement. There are going to be actions I take they don’t like, and there are going to be bills they pass that I don’t like. And I think, moving forward, that’s exactly what’s going to happen. You’ve mentioned areas where we disagree. I believe that America is a nation of immigrants. Everybody agrees that the system is broken. There has been ample opportunity for Congress to pass a bipartisan immigration bill that would strengthen our borders, improve the legal immigration system, lift millions of people out of the shadows so they are paying taxes and getting right by the law. It passed out of the Senate. I gave the House over a year to go ahead and at least give a vote to the Senate bilaterally; they failed to do so. And I indicated to Speaker Boehner several months ago that if, in fact, Congress failed to act, I would use all the lawful authority that I possess to try to make the system work better. And that’s going to happen. That’s going to happen before the end of the year. But what I’ve also said to them -- and I said this during the lunch with the Speaker and Leader McConnell -- is that I am always interested in negotiating a legislative solution to the immigration problem, and that the minute they pass a bill that I can sign that fixes our immigration system, then any executive actions I take are replaced. So they have the ability to fix the system. What they don’t have the ability to do is to expect me to stand by with a broken system in perpetuity. And I would advise that if, in fact, they want to take a different approach, rather than devote a lot of time trying to constrain my lawful actions as the Chief Executive of the U.S. government in charge of our enforcing our immigration laws, that they spend some time passing a bill and engaging with all the stakeholders, the immigrant rights groups, the law enforcement groups, the evangelicals, the business community, all of whom have said this is something that needs to be done, is way overdue. And we’ve been talking about it for 10 years now, and it’s been consistently stalled. So with respect to Keystone, I’ve been clear in the past, Pete, my position hasn’t changed, that this is a process that is supposed to be followed. Right now you have a case pending in Nebraska, where the pipeline would run through, in which a state court judge has questioned the plan. And until we know what the route is, it’s very hard to finish that evaluation. And I don’t think we should short-circuit that process. I have also noted that, as policy matter, my government believes that we should judge this pipeline based on whether or not it accelerates climate change or whether it helps the American people with their energy costs and their gas prices. And I have to constantly push back against this idea that somehow the Keystone pipeline is either this massive jobs bill for the United States, or is somehow lowering gas prices. Understand what this project is. It is providing the ability of Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else. That doesn't have an impact on U.S. gas prices. You know what does have an impact on U.S. gas prices is the incredible boom in U.S. oil production and natural gas production that's taken place under my administration. And if my Republican friends really want to focus on what's good for the American people in terms of job creation and lower energy costs, we should be engaging in a conversation about what are we doing to produce even more homegrown energy. I'm happy to have that conversation. With respect to the climate change deal, I have been very clear that I have responsibilities as President not just to current generations, but to future generations. The science is indisputable. The planet is getting warm, and it is getting warmer in part because of man-made activity. And the release of carbon gases -- carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere can have a potentially devastating effect that will cost our country, could devastate communities, could increase the impact of natural disasters, and will have an impact worldwide that is destabilizing and could affect our national security. That's not my opinion, by the way, that is the opinion of our Joint Chiefs of Staff, that climate change is a direct national security threat. Now the argument that I've received in the past has been either denial of the science or, alternatively, there's no point in us doing something about it despite us being one of the two largest emitters in the world, because if we do something and China doesn't do anything, we'll just put ourselves at a competitive disadvantage, we'll lose jobs to China, and the problem won't be solved anyway. I'm not going deny the science, but I took seriously the notion that we want all countries to participate in solving a global problem. And so I engaged with China over a lengthy set of negotiations. And by all independent accounts, for the first time, we got China to make a very serious commitment to constrain its greenhouse gases. Why would anybody be against that? That sounds like the right thing to do to me. So that's a response to those specific ideas. But let me reiterate what I said at the top. The fact that I disagree or Republicans disagree with me on a certain set of issues doesn't exclude us working together on a whole range of issues where we do agree. They're interested in tax reform -- so am I. Let's get to work. They're interested in promoting trade that will create jobs and opportunity for U.S. workers and U.S. businesses -- all over it. It's part of what this Asia trip has been all about.They're interested in rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, putting people back to work, making sure we're competitive -- I'm game. So the one thing that I think is going to be important for us to have a successful partnership over the next couple of years is not making disagreements on a single issue suddenly a deal-breaker on every issue. Democracy can never work that way because there are always going to be some differences. And when there are differences you can't elevate those differences above the commonalities. I'm sorry that was a long answer, but it was a lot of questions. Do you want to -- DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI: I'm sorry the President can't get away from all those. PRESIDENT OBAMA: I know. But before Daw Suu responds to the point about the constitutional amendment, I just want to emphasize, ultimately it's up to the people of Burma to make a decision about all these provisions. I expressed an objective view that some of current provisions don't seem to have much grounding in common sense or precedent when you look at other constitutions around the world, and seem more focused on advantaging or disadvantaging certain players. And one of the basic concepts of a constitution is that it creates a level playing field for all people, and then so I use that as an example not because I think my voice is the one that's most relevant in terms of the constitutional amendment process, but ultimately it's up to the people of Burma. Q (Off-mic.) PRESIDENT OBAMA: I did? It doesn't make much sense to me. DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI: I believe democracy should stand up for that principle. PRESIDENT OBAMA: Absolutely. DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI: Well, I've always said that it's somewhat flattering to have a constitution written with me in mind. But it shouldn't be done that way. That's not how a democratic constitution should be written. And we object to that clause not because -- not because it debars me from the presidency as such, but because it is against the principle of democracy and also unconstitutional. The constitution says that all citizens should be treated as equals, and this is discrimination on the grounds of my children, my children's spouses, et cetera, et cetera. Now, this is not acceptable. And our people are firmly behind us in our desire to change this clause. And if President Obama said anything about the necessity to change a clause like that, they will love him very much for it. (Laughter.) So he will be very popular among our people. And as he said, in the end, it is up to our people to shape the destiny of our country, including the way the constitution is going to be rewritten. And I think the majority of our people understand that this constitution cannot stand as it is if we want to make the full transition to democracy; 59(f), as you know, debars anybody who is children of -- the spouses of the children belong to -- are citizens of another country. And according to the law -- and I think the President will know the law better than I do because I'm not a lawyer -- according to the law, anybody who is over the age of 18, or whatever legal adult age may be in his or her country, is responsible for himself or herself. Nobody else is responsible for that person. So from that point of view also, you cannot penalize anybody for what his or her adult children do. From that point of view, it's illegal, it's against all norms of justice. And from the point of view of democracy, it is not right to discriminate against one particular citizen. You wouldn't like to be discriminated against, would you? So I think our people support the idea of amending this clause because -- not particularly because they want me to be president, perhaps because they do. But I don't think it is so much because of that, but because they realize that this is unfair, unjust and undemocratic. Q Thank you. I would like to ask the question to Mr. President. The question is, have you discussed about the very situation in Myanmar (inaudible)? Because more journalists and politicians have been arrested, particularly (inaudible) under the present administration. (Inaudible) how he responds to this (inaudible)? Thank you. PRESIDENT OBAMA: I didn't bring up specific cases with him. I brought up a basic principle that I stated earlier, which is that a free press is a foundation for any democracy. We rely on journalists to explain and describe the actions of our government. If the government controls the journalists, then it's very difficult for citizens to hold that government accountable. It's a fairly straightforward proposition. And I recognize that there is a transition process that's taking place, that there is a more robust debate today than there was the last time I visited. But to go back to what we said earlier, we can't be complacent. And we, as a government, are going to be troubled when we hear reports of journalists being imprisoned, being killed, being intimidated, or being censored. And when we engage with this government -- or any government -- and we have evidence that that's taking place, then we're going to raise it. Thank you very much. END 1:10 P.M.

Other bills  of interest  Here are some highlights of legislation introduced this week in Oregon's 2011 Legislature:  House Bill 2250:  Would require the State Parks and Recreation Commission to try for an agreement with Portland Parks and Recreation to acquire Forest Park.  House Bill 2749:  Would create offense of driving while drowsy.  House Bill 2140:  Would require anyone younger than 18 and living in Clackamas, Multnomah or Washington county to complete traffic safety education course before obtaining a provisional driver's license.  Senate Bill 4:  Would require school districts to ensure that physical education or recess time is available each school day for students in kindergarten through eighth grade.  Senate Bill 7:  Would create income tax credit for creation of new employment positions.  Senate Bill 130:  Would add green, yellow and red bicycle signals to list of traffic control devices.  Senate Bill 503:  Would suspend cost-of-living raises, filling of vacant positions and out-of-state travel for state government workers through June 30.  Lawmakers return Feb. 1 to begin the real work of slogging through legislation and plugging a $3.5 billion hole in the next budget. The bills that await them suggest Oregonians will hear much debate about taxes. It also appears that lawmakers are ready to take on public employee compensation and retirement and to consider fairly radical reforms to the state's K-12 public schools and universities.  Some measures introduced this week are repeats -- there are a few bills drafted every session for symbolic or political reasons, but they don't usually get a hearing. Among them this time:  , which would allow Oregonians to pump their own gas and  , which would designate English as the state's official language.  There are also a number of bills aimed at breaking questionable habits. For example,  would make it illegal to carry a child younger than 6 on a bicycle or in a bicycle trailer.  proposes a $90 fine for those who drive with an animal on their lap.  Got your attention? Here's a look at other pending action:  Of border collies and classical music  Every session, there are bills that seem cute and easy, but spark a big fight.  This year's nominee is  , which would designate the border collie as the state dog.  After criticizing a bill last session that named the Dungeness crab the official state crustacean,  R-John Day, admitted he's feeling kind of sheepish about introducing his border collie bill.  A constituent asked him to submit the measure, Ferrioli said, noting that even he thinks the chances are slim.  How, he asked, do you convince the dachshund owners that the border collie should be the state dog?  And then there are measures that appear frivolous, until they're explained.  would require TriMet to broadcast classical music at MAX light-rail stations in high-crime areas.  We shouldn't let the fear of looking silly get in the way of a good idea, said Rep.  a Portland Democrat and the bill's sponsor.  Piped-in classical music has helped reduce robberies, drug calls and vandalism in Florida, London and Tokyo, Smith said.  Here in Oregon, he said, a test last month at the MAX station at 162nd Avenue and Burnside saw crime down 41 percent compared with December 2009.  MAX safety is a big issue in my district, Smith said. We don't have any money for anything and this is, perhaps, the most cost-effective safety idea in the world.  It's your money  Former Gov. Ted Kulongoski urged legislators to change the kicker tax law last year, but they didn't want to go there -- especially with an election coming up. But Sen.  , a Portland Democrat and chair of the Senate Finance and Revenue Committee said the 2011 Legislature must commit to kicker reform.  There are a number of kicker bills. Some propose to divert any income above the state's expected forecasted revenue into a reserve account rather than returning it to taxpayers. Others would keep all or part of the kicker for individual taxpayers but funnel the corporate kicker into state savings.  Lawmakers also may revisit Measure 67, a controversial proposal raising the state's corporate minimum tax. It passed during the 2009 Legislature and was endorsed by voters last January but has continued to leave a sour taste in the business community.  proposes an alternative method of assessing the corporate minimum while  would repeal Measure 67 outright.  Schools: Raising the grade  A number of bills take direct aim at improving public school performance. Among the most dramatic is  , which would prohibit schools from allowing a student to leave third grade if he is not reading at or above a third-grade reading level.  You want to intervene on problems early and get them taken care of rather than shuffling students along, said  , a Wilsonville Republican who was named co-chair of the House Education Committee this week.  Democrats have their own ideas about reform, too.  Twin bills,  and  , designate the governor as the state's superintendent of public instruction as opposed to the separately elected state superintendent of schools.  , a Eugene Democrat and legislation sponsor, says the ultimate responsibility for Oregon's schools ought to rest with the top elected leader.  The idea isn't a new one, he said, but this is the session for making significant changes.  --","Oregon Legislature introduces more than 1,600 bills before taking a break until Feb. 1",mixture,

By Chrsitopher Cadelago Fresno  Antonio Villaraigosa, stopping off Wednesday in the Central Valley to survey construction of the state’s oft-debated high speed rail system, accused Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom of repeatedly equivocating on the project, criticizing his Democratic rival for governor of being “for it, before he’s against it, and then he’s for it again.”  The former Los Angeles mayor suggested Newsom, the frontrunner in next year’s contest, was revising his positions “when the winds blow in his direction.”  Newsom was an early backer of the rail project, and he campaigned for the $9.95 billion bond measure in 2008. But his opinion soured over route and business plan deviations. Newsom told a Seattle radio program in 2014 that he would use the money for “other, more pressing infrastructure needs.”  Campaigning for governor, he now says he would work to identify more funding, specifically private investment, yet he still worries about the viability of the $64 billion project considered one of the signature infrastructure efforts of Gov. Jerry Brown.  Villaraigosa said Newsom’s shifting rail statements illustrate a broader approach to campaigning.

Newsom’s campaign dismissed the critique, offering that he’s consistently expressed doubts about the project’s ability to attract private dollars, particularly after its route, originally pitched to bond voters as focusing on Los Angeles to San Francisco, was replaced with an initial 32-mile segment under construction between Fresno and Madera counties.  Newsom spokesman Dan Newman said Villaraigosa’s charges are “particularly ludicrous considering the source.”  He ripped Villaraigosa for attending a chamber of commerce political function in Fresno and pointed to his past support for a non-partisan effort, the Campaign to Fix the Debt, which proposed various changes to entitlements like Medicare and Social Security.  “He used to be a Democratic labor organizer, and today he’s literally raising money to support Republicans,” Newman said. “That’s Guinness Book of Records flip floppery.” Capitol Alert newsletter  Get political and Capitol news in your inbox every weekday, plus breaking alerts.

f1ad8b82,"Democrats have said they only intend to restore the tax rates that existed during the Clinton years. In reality they're proposing rates like those under President Carter. Media reports in recent weeks say that Senate Democrats are considering a 3% surtax on income over $1 million to raise federal revenues. This would come on top of the higher income tax rates that President Obama has already proposed through the cancellation of the Bush era tax-rate reductions. If the Democrats' millionaire surtax were to happen—and were added to other tax increases already enacted last year and other leading tax hike ideas on the table this year—this could leave the U.S. with a combined federal and state top tax rate on earnings of 62%. That's more than double the highest federal marginal rate of 28% when President Reagan left office in 1989. Welcome back to the 1970s. Here's the math behind that depressing calculation. Today's top federal income tax rate is 35%. Almost all Democrats in Washington want to repeal the Bush tax cuts on those who make more than $250,000 and phase out certain deductions, so the effective income tax rate would rise to about 41.5%. The 3% millionaire surtax raises that rate to 44.5%. Then last year, as part of the down payment for ObamaCare, Congress snuck in an extra 0.9% Medicare surtax on ""high-income earners,"" meaning any individual earning more than $200,000 or couples earning more than $250,000. This brings the total tax rate to 47.9%.",Texans Breathe a Sigh of Relief,mixture,
1a46b040,"Howl, beat your head against the wall, tear your hair and despair of this country. How can it be that nearly half the population thinks the reason people lost their jobs in the pandemic was due to their own underperformance? Just 31% attribute it to bad luck. Look around every city and town to see the shuttered shops, closed offices, boarded-up pubs, bars and restaurants, the blindingly obvious signs of the mass loss of jobs. Yet again those on the left are forced to confront some dismal realities about British public attitudes.  King’s College London’s deep research into how people feel about inequality is enough to all but extinguish political hope. It’s nice to know that Labour supporters are kinder than their Tory counterparts, but even so, a shocking 39% of Labour voters think it’s people’s own fault they lost their jobs, as this week the unemployment rate hit 5%, with worse to come.  Why does it keep shocking us, since the British people have most commonly voted in Conservative governments, with Labour crushed again and again? The Brexit vote came as the heaviest hammer-blow in living memory, followed by Boris Johnson’s triumph. This research shows that enthusing the public with a strong enough will to significantly reduce inequality requires exceptionally clever efforts of persuasion.  “There is no widespread appetite for change,” concludes the final section of this devastating report. What a blow to all of us who hope this crisis can be a 1945 moment, that the state’s massive intervention for the survival of so many might have whetted the appetite for more. “We should not expect a widespread reappraisal of the case for greater government intervention in the economy, despite the economic hardship wrought by the pandemic,” is the sobering conclusion.  Its lead author, Professor Bobby Duffy, long-time Ipsos Mori researcher on social attitudes, reminded me that there has been historic change for the better in attitudes on race, gender and sexuality, and that younger people are considerably more progressive than those who are old. But when I talked to him, he warned that attitudes can change again: “It doesn’t mean there won’t be backsliding.”  He warned on race that a fixed 13% have toxic racist attitudes. A quarter of people think Covid causing a rise in ethnic inequality wouldn’t be problem, though 67% say it would. Gender inequality ranks low as a concern, possibly because an older generation remember how much that has already improved.  Here’s the great political gulf, which interestingly falls along Brexit-related lines: two-thirds of Labour remainers believe the crisis justifies more state intervention, compared to only one in five Conservative leavers. The pandemic has barely shifted views, despite all that clapping for carers and key workers. While 82% of Labour remainers believed Britain was unequal before the coronavirus outbreak, that view is shared by just 53% of Conservative leavers. What should be done about it now? That depends on how the question is phrased: use the word “redistribution” and support for action is just 48%, but phrase it as “government should take measures to reduce differences in income levels” and support rises to 62%. Tax those who are very rich and companies, but not themselves, is roughly how that translates, as in much other polling.  The one question of disadvantage on which most agree is inequality of place. Some 61% agree that inequalities between more and less deprived areas are the most serious kind. Paul Johnson, head of the IFS, for whom this research forms part of its Deaton Review of Inequalities, finds this startling. He puzzles over whether people mean north and south, say Burnley versus Twickenham, or do they, he hopes, mean the divide between poor and rich districts everywhere? London, for example, may have grotesque wealth among City bankers, but it has the most poverty too, and he says, is by far the hardest hit by unemployment caused by the pandemic. Averages deceive wickedly.  “Take the real divide between graduates and non-graduates,” Johnson says. “After counting housing costs, a graduate in Burnley has the same income as one in Twickenham, but lots more graduates living in Twickenham give it a high average.” Can that simple fact be explained, so people realise that levelling up is not just big projects in the north, but levelling up low incomes everywhere?  These findings will warm the cockles of Conservative hearts, but present painful dilemmas for Labour. Tackling inequality is Labour’s great cause, but that may be a rebarbative word with too many voters. Paul Johnson recalls, “Tony Blair never mentioned inequality, yet with tax credits, did more than any government to ease poverty.” Blair spoke instead of “social exclusion”. Those who criticise Keir Starmer for his caution should study this report in depth.  Most depressing is how many people attribute success and failure only to hard work and ambition: people believe this is a meritocracy, not a system governed by birth and luck. Prof Duffy talked of how since the 1970s individual blame has replaced systemic injustice as people’s explanation for inequality. Britain was at its most equal in 1975, but with the blast of Thatcherism that took the lid off top earnings and saw bottom earnings fall back, came a dose of Americanised individualism. More than half the workforce belonged to a union in the 1970s, and they were vectors not just of power, but political education. Now only 23% are members and unions’ political influence is weak in public discourse. The collective is replaced with a warped idea of merit, disseminated by the right, deliberately ignoring the social injustices that predestine futures from birth.  Because we have to live in hope, and yet also cleave to realism, this research suggests the best way to engage voters with inequality is through locality and place.

acc4517a,"It was an accurate and judicious answer, so naturally it sent climate alarmists into paroxysms of condemnation. The Washington Post slammed Pruitt as a “denier” driven by “unreason.” Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii called Pruitt’s views “extreme” and “irresponsible” — proof of his unfitness to head the EPA. Gina McCarthy, who ran the agency under President Obama, bewailed the danger global warming poses “to all of us who call Earth home,” and said she couldn’t “imagine what additional information [Pruitt] might want from scientists” in order to understand that.  Replied Pruitt: “No. I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact. So no — I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. But we don’t know that yet. We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis.”  ‘Do you believe,” CNBC’s Joe Kernen asked Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency’s new director, in an interview last Thursday, “that it’s been proven that CO2 is the primary control knob for climate?”  Yet for all the hyperventilating, Pruitt’s answer to the question he was asked — whether carbon dioxide is the climate’s “primary control knob” — was entirely sound. “We don’t know that yet,” he said. We don’t. CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases. By contrast, carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere: about 400 ppm (parts per million), or 0.04 percent. Moreover, its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm. Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red. A second coat of paint has much less of an effect, while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all.  Advertisement  There is a popular theory that atmospheric CO2 amplifies the creation of water vapor, thereby increasing warming through a “positive feedback loop.” But that theory so far is mostly speculative; climate projections using models based on it have consistently failed, nearly always predicting far more warming than has occurred. It should go without saying that if scientists cannot yet make accurate predictions about future climate change, then their understanding of climate science remains highly incomplete.  Advertisement  Earth’s climate system is unfathomably complex. It is affected by innumerable interacting variables, atmospheric CO2 levels being just one. The more variables there are in any system or train of events, the lower the probability of all of them coming to pass. Your odds of correctly guessing the outcome of a flipped coin are 1 in 2, but your odds of guessing correctly twice in a row are only 1 in 4 — i.e., ½ x ½ Extending your winning streak to a third guess is even less probable: just 1 in 8.  Apply that approach to climate change, and it becomes clear why the best response to the alarmists’ frantic predictions is a healthy skepticism.  The list of variables that shape climate includes cloud formation, topography, altitude, proximity to the equator, plate tectonics, sunspot cycles, volcanic activity, expansion or contraction of sea ice, conversion of land to agriculture, deforestation, reforestation, direction of winds, soil quality, El Niño and La Niña ocean cycles, prevalence of aerosols (airborne soot, dust, and salt) — and, of course, atmospheric greenhouse gases, both natural and manmade. A comprehensive list would run to hundreds, if not thousands, of elements, none of which scientists would claim to understand with absolute precision.  Advertisement  But for the sake of argument, say there are merely 15 variables involved in predicting global climate change, and assume that climatologists have mastered each one to a near-perfect accuracy of 95 percent. What are the odds that a climate model built on a system that simple would be reliable? Less than 50/50. (Multiplying .95 by itself 15 times yields 46.3 percent.) Is it any surprise that climate-change predictions in the real world — where the complexities are exponentially greater and the exactitude of knowledge much less — have such a poor track record?  Pruitt got it right: Measuring human impacts on climate is indeed “very challenging.” The science is far from settled. That is why calls to radically reduce carbon emissions are so irresponsible — and why dire warnings of what will happen if we don’t are little better than reckless fearmongering.",Why are climate-change models so flawed?

,"he Great Barrier Reef is experiencing incredible growth — and the media are silent. The Australian government’s most recent official report on reef recovery indicates that coral cover at the Northern Great Barrier Reef “continued to increase to 27% from the most recent low point in 2017.” Meanwhile, the Central Great Barrier Reef saw a 26% increase in hard coral cover. Indeed, the study stated that over thirty-five years of monitoring, the Great Barrier Reef has consistently “shown an ability to recover after disturbances.” Nevertheless, coverage of the Great Barrier Reef from mainstream media outlets portray a starkly different narrative.The New York Times, for instance, reported in April 2018 that “an underwater heat wave that damaged huge sections of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef two years ago spurred a die-off of coral so severe that scientists say the natural wonder will never look the same again.” The article pushed governments to honor the Paris Climate Agreement; the author argued that by complying with the treaty, Australia will “still have the Great Barrier Reef in 50 years” — although it “would still look very different from today.” As recently as October 2020, The Washington Post ran an article called “Warming has killed half the coral on the Great Barrier Reef, study finds. It might never recover.” The piece argued that technological advancements meant to aid reef recovery “might not be enough for a country that continues to lead the world in exporting coal, a fossil fuel that contributes to warming, which hastens the decline of coral.” Indeed, Center for Industrial Progress Founder and President Alex Epstein noted that the mainstream media has been quick to cover the Great Barrier Reef’s decline — but not its rapid rebound. “The climate media’s evasion of the Great Barrier Reef improvement confirms that they have no interest in the truth about what’s happening with climate and why,” he said on Twitter. “They are interested in attacking fossil fuels, attacking capitalism, and justifying vast expansions of government power.” “Any science editor that covered the decline of the Great Barrier Reef but not its improvement” — including those at The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, The Guardian, USA Today, and National Geographic — “should commit to correcting their failures or be pressured into resigning.” He also noted that celebrities such as Mark Ruffalo and Leonardo DiCaprio — who have publicly “catastrophized” about the Great Barrier Reef — should “celebrate, share the good news, and walk back their climate catastrophism.” “Why does it matter so much that the climate media only cover negative stories and ignore positive ones?” asked Epstein. “Because it contributes to deadly energy policy by catastrophizing the side-effects of the fossil fuels that modern life depends on, while ignoring their massive benefits.”","Despite Climate Change Fearmongering, Study Shows The Great Barrier Reef Is Growing Quickly",mixture,323227460357966615601120845837855078115
93994bac,"The introduction of Universal Credit UC will leave working families worse off on average, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said. UC, which combines six benefits into one monthly payment, was intended to be more generous than the current system but the IFS said cuts to the programme meant this would not be the case. But it said UC would encourage people into work and save £2.7bn a year. Ministers said the IFS had ignored other benefits such as extra childcare. Universal Credit's single payment replaces six current benefits, including Jobseeker's Allowance JSA and Employment and Support Allowance ESA. According to the IFS research, an estimated 2.1 million families will face an average loss of £1,600 a year, while 1.8 million will gain an average of £1,500. Its figures suggest 1.1 million homes with no-one in paid work will lose out by about £2,300 a year, while 500,000 are expected to gain of £1,000. Working single parents are said to face an annual loss of £1,000. The new payments system still only affects a minority of claimants, but it is gradually being rolled out across the country. Single parents Robert Joyce, the author of the IFS report, added: The potential gains from simplifying the working-age benefit system remain mostly intact: Universal Credit should make the system easier to understand, ease transitions into and out of work, and largely get rid of the most extreme disincentives to work or to earn more created by the current system. The government has always said that Universal Credit UC would encourage more people to find work. The IFS said that was true for most people, but not all. It said that single parents, for example, had less of an incentive to work under UC than under the old system. Where couples are concerned, UC encourages just one of them to find employment, rather than both, the IFS claimed. Single parents claiming UC will keep 8% less of their earnings than previously, its figures suggest. People outside Jobcentre Plus officeimage copyrightPA image captionFrom April 2017, new UC applicants will only be able to claim for a maximum of two children 'Evasive' Although Chancellor George Osborne abandoned cuts to tax credits in the Autumn, cuts to UC announced last summer will still go ahead. From this April the amount that anyone on UC can earn before their benefits are cut will be reduced. This so-called Work Allowance will be £4,764 for those not claiming for housing costs, or £2,304 for those who do. Once claimants earn above that amount, they lose 65p for every pound they are paid. From April 2017, parents making new UC claims will only be able to take their first two children into account, while the first child premium will be abolished. Separately, a committee of MPs has also complained that UC is getting further and further behind schedule. The Public Accounts Committee report accused the Department for Work and Pensions DWP of being evasive when asked about the delays. But the DWP said that the programme was being rolled out safely and securely and would be completed by March 2021. The overhaul of the welfare system has been driven by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who argued that too many people were trapped on benefits. But shadow work and pensions secretary Owen Smith said Mr Duncan Smith's claims were in tatters. He said everyone can now see that successive cuts to Universal Credit have destroyed many of the work incentives that were supposed to be the very reason for the scheme, hitting single parents particularly hard. The government has always said that no individuals will lose money as a result of the changes. New claimants for UC will also be helped by transitional support. And a spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: Universal Credit will make work pay and increase financial incentives for people to work more, while also bringing the welfare bill under control. He added: Universal Credit also includes a wide range of additional benefits - including increased childcare and more support from a dedicated work coach both things that were ignored in the IFS's analysis.",051316 repisraelpr,mixture,
f6e63818,"For the last four years, the Obama administration has provided funding and incentives for states to help build a teaching profession that is both respected and rigorous. Today, we're starting to see that investment pay off -- in expanded collaboration among teachers and improved performance among students. More teachers today are treated as true professionals, instead of as interchangeable cogs in an educational assembly line. Exhibit A: Tennessee. Tennessee -- one of the first two states to win a federal Race to the Top grant -- recently released an important report on the first year of implementing its new teacher evaluation system. The report found that after one year, Tennessee's students made their biggest single-year jump in achievement ever recorded in the state. That is a remarkable accomplishment. During the first two years of the Race to the Top grant, from 2010 to 2012, an additional 55,000 students in Tennessee were at or above grade level in math and 38,000 additional students were at or above grade level in science. But Tennessee's story also shows that reforming antiquated practices for evaluating teachers is hard, ongoing work -- work that is far from finished. Few would dispute that the existing system for evaluating teacher performance is broken. Principals typically evaluate teachers' performance based on infrequent and informal observations and fail to take account of a teacher's impact on student learning. Great teachers are not recognized or rewarded. And struggling teachers neither get the feedback nor the professional assistance they need to improve. Under the old Tennessee system, tenured teachers were evaluated just twice a decade. A teacher's impact on student growth did not factor at all into their performance evaluation. Not surprisingly, virtually all teachers received positive ratings. Even so, many skeptics protested after Tennessee enacted a state law in 2010 that required 50 percent of a teacher's evaluation be based on student achievement data -- 35 percent on student growth, with the other 15 percent based on other measures of student achievement. The remaining 50 percent of the evaluation would be based on traditional qualitative measures, like observations of teachers by their principals. The initial blowback to implementing the law was considerable. Critics argued that test score gains were too imperfect a measure to use in teacher evaluation. Others said that for teachers in non-tested subjects like music or fine arts, it was unfair to base part of the evaluation on school-wide math and English test results. A New York Times reporter lampooned the new system, intoning, ""in the end, it's all about distrust: not trusting principals to judge teachers, not trusting teachers to educate children."" But the Tennessee department of education didn't ignore the critics of the new evaluation systems -- in fact, it listened to them and sought their feedback. Department officials met with 7,500 teachers around the state and surveyed 16,000 teachers and 1,000 administrators for input on the new evaluation system. In Memphis, arts teachers were frustrated because they were being evaluated based in part on school-wide performance in math and English. So Dru Davison, a music teacher in Memphis, convened a group of arts educators to come up with a fairer system. After surveying arts teachers in Memphis, Davison's committee developed a blind peer review evaluation to assess portfolios of student learning in the arts. It has proved so popular that Tennessee is looking at adopting the system statewide. As a result of the feedback the state received -- and with the benefit of real evidence of teacher impact on growth in student learning from almost 20,000 teachers -- the department recommended a number of changes to the teacher evaluation system. Their recently released report, for example, recommends that teachers who receive top scores should have a more streamlined evaluation the following year -- while teachers with low scores should receive additional observations and feedback from their principals. What are some of the takeaway lessons from Tennessee's experience? First, student growth can and should be one of a number of measures in evaluating the performance of teachers -- and it's important not to ignore a teacher's impact on student learning just because it is difficult to measure. Better evaluation systems improve classroom instruction. Delaware, the other state to win a first-round Race to the Top grant, has also seen big increases in student achievement. Second, it's true that there is no perfect system of teacher evaluation, but Tennessee did not let the perfect become the enemy of the good. They insisted on asking the compared-to-what question -- how do the strengths and weaknesses of the new system compare to the old system? And finally, because rigorous teacher evaluation systems are still a work in progress, it is vital that school leaders and administrators continue to solicit feedback, learn from their mistakes, and make improvements. One example: Tennessee's report found that principals are still largely unwilling to give weak teachers in need of assistance a poor performance review. As Tennessee has shown, our children, our teachers, and our country will be better off when school leaders and educators finally undertake the challenging task of creating a meaningful and useful system for supporting and evaluating our nation's teachers. --Arne Duncan is the U.S. Secretary of Education",The Tennessee Story,mixture,

53d111d0,"The primary school population in England has continued to rise sharply, with 94,000 extra pupils this year, reaching the highest levels since the 1970s. The 2.1% increase in primary numbers is equivalent to six more pupils for every school. Minority ethnic pupils made up 71% of the increase, says the Department for Education's school census report. The annual figures show there are now more super-sized primary schools. It will mean more funding demands to create extra places and pressure on places for families looking for schools. There are now 87 primary schools with more than 800 pupils, up from 77 in 2014 and 58 in 2013. The number of infants in classes above the limit of 30 pupils has increased again - with 100,800 pupils in these over-sized classes, an increase of 8% compared with 2014. The number has more than doubled since 2012, when there were about 47,000 infants in classes of more than 30. In 2008, the figure was fewer than 25,000. Changing demographics The figures from the annual school census show numbers rising across the state school system - up by 2.1% in primary and 0.1% in secondary - to a total of 8.4 million pupils. This is an increase of about 200,000 children in two years. The rising population has been a particular challenge for primary schools, which have been having to expand to absorb the increasing numbers. But this rising population wave has now reached secondary schools. The analysis says that the rise in primary school numbers is particularly driven by rising number of ethnic minority pupils, accounting for more than two-thirds of the increase. In primary schools, 30.4% of pupils are from an ethnic minority, compared with 29.5% the previous year. But there are wide regional variations. In the inner London boroughs, 81% of pupils are from ethnic minorities; while in north-east England, the figure is below 11%. And at council level, in Newham 94% of pupils are from ethnic minorities, while in Durham the figure is below 5%. In inner London, the biggest ethnic group in primary school are black pupils, predominantly from an African background, with Asian pupils the second biggest group. In secondary schools, about 27% of pupils are ethnic minorities, which the report says represents an increase of about 30% in six years. Despite the rising number of pupils there has not been a growth in the number of primary schools, which have been consistently falling since the 1980s. Instead, primary schools have been getting bigger, with more pupils in schools with more than 800 pupils. Primary pupil numbers had been declining until 2009, but they have been rising sharply since. 'Good local school' Funding this demand for extra places - forecast to be another 460,000 during the next five years - has been a continuing pressure on the schools budget. In the general election campaign, the Conservatives committed themselves to protecting per-pupil spending, including for rising numbers. A DfE spokesman said: The average infant class size has remained stable at 27.4 and the number of unlawfully large infant classes has fallen - down 137 compared to 2009 - all despite a small increase in pupil numbers since last year. To help schools respond to rising pupils numbers, the government invested £5bn between 2011 and 2015 to support local authorities - creating almost half a million new places. On top of that, we have committed to invest a further £7bn on new school places over the next six years, to support the new school places needed all the way up to September 2021. The government has also opened over 250 free schools since 2010 and we are committed to creating at least 500 more during this parliament, creating over 400,000 new school places and ensuring even more parents have access to a good local school for their child. Tristram Hunt, Labour's shadow education secretary, said: The growing pressures on primary school class sizes should compel the government to rethink how it is allocating funding for schools. The case is clear. In the early years of primary school, children in classes capped at 30 are more likely to make better progress. It cannot make sense for the government to continue to prioritise money for new free schools in areas with surplus school places when we have more than 100,000 primary pupils being taught in classes of more than 30.",,mixture,
caa34051,"A domino-like cascade of melting ice, warming seas, shifting currents and dying forests could tilt the Earth into a “hothouse” state beyond which human efforts to reduce emissions will be increasingly futile, a group of leading climate scientists has warned.  This grim prospect is sketched out in a journal paper that considers the combined consequences of 10 climate change processes, including the release of methane trapped in Siberian permafrost and the impact of melting ice in Greenland on the Antarctic.  The authors of the essay, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, stress their analysis is not conclusive, but warn the Paris commitment to keep warming at 2C above pre-industrial levels may not be enough to “park” the planet’s climate at a stable temperature.  They warn that the hothouse trajectory “would almost certainly flood deltaic environments, increase the risk of damage from coastal storms, and eliminate coral reefs (and all of the benefits that they provide for societies) by the end of this century or earlier.”  Fifty years ago, this would be dismissed as alarmist, but now scientists have become really worried Johan Rockström, executive ​director, Stockholm Resilience Centre  “I do hope we are wrong, but as scientists we have a responsibility to explore whether this is real,” said Johan Rockström, executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre. “We need to know now. It’s so urgent. This is one of the most existential questions in science.”  Rockström and his co-authors are among the world’s leading authorities on positive feedback loops, by which warming temperatures release new sources of greenhouse gases or destroy the Earth’s ability to absorb carbon or reflect heat.  Their new paper asks whether the planet’s temperature can stabilise at 2C or whether it will gravitate towards a more extreme state. The authors attempt to assess whether warming can be halted or whether it will tip towards a “hothouse” world that is 4C warmer than pre-industrial times and far less supportive of human life.  Katherine Richardson from the University of Copenhagen, one of the authors, said the paper showed that climate action was not just a case of turning the knob on emissions, but of understanding how various factors interact at a global level.  “We note that the Earth has never in its history had a quasi-stable state that is around 2C warmer than the preindustrial and suggest that there is substantial risk that the system, itself, will ‘want’ to continue warming because of all of these other processes – even if we stop emissions,” she said. “This implies not only reducing emissions but much more.”  New feedback loops are still being discovered. A separate paper published in PNAS reveals that increased rainfall – a symptom of climate change in some regions - is making it harder for forest soils to trap greenhouse gases such as methane.    Previous studies have shown that weakening carbon sinks will add 0.25C, forest dieback will add 0.11C, permafrost thaw will add 0.9C and increased bacterial respiration will add 0.02C. The authors of the new paper also look at the loss of methane hydrates from the ocean floor and the reduction of snow and ice cover at the poles.  Rockström says there are huge gaps in data and knowledge about how one process might amplify another. Contrary to the Gaia theory, which suggests the Earth has a self-righting tendency, he says the feedbacks could push the planet to a more extreme state.  As an example, the authors say the loss of Greenland ice could disrupt the Gulf Stream ocean current, which would raise sea levels and accumulate heat in the Southern Ocean, which would in turn accelerate ice loss from the east Antarctic. Concerns about this possibility were heightened earlier this year by reports that the Gulf Stream was at its weakest level in 1,600 years.  Currently, global average temperatures are just over 1C above pre-industrial levels and rising at 0.17C per decade. The Paris climate agreement set actions to keep warming limited to 1.5C-2C by the end of the century, but the authors warn more drastic action may be necessary.  “The heatwave we now have in Europe is not something that was expected with just 1C of warming,” Rockström said. “Several positive feedback loops are already in operation, but they are still weak. We need studies to show when they might cause a runaway effect.  Another climate scientist – who was not involved in the paper – emphasised the document aimed to raise questions rather than prove a theory. “It’s rather selective, but not outlandish,” said Prof Martin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute. “Threshold and tipping points have been discussed previously, but to state that 2C is a threshold we can’t pull back from is new, I think. I’m not sure what ‘evidence’ there is for this – or indeed whether there can be until we experience it.”  Rockström said the question needed asking. “We could end up delivering the Paris agreement and keep to 2C of warming, but then face an ugly surprise if the system starts to slip away,” he said. “We don’t say this will definitely happen. We just list all the disruptive events and come up with plausible occurrences … 50 years ago, this would be dismissed as alarmist, but now scientists have become really worried.”  “In the context of the summer of 2018, this is definitely not a case of crying wolf, raising a false alarm: the wolves are now in sight,” said Dr Phil Williamson, a climate researcher at the University of East Anglia. “The authors argue that we need to be much more proactive in that regard, not just ending greenhouse gas emissions as rapidly as possible, but also building resilience in the context of complex Earth system processes that we might not fully understand until it is too late.”",Domino-effect of climate events could move Earth into a ‘hothouse’ state,mixture,

940bb348,"SHARE By Mary Burke's support of the proposal to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour might make for good politicking in her campaign for governor, but her plan would be economically devastating to thousands of Wisconsin workers. Raising the minimum wage is a lose-lose proposition because it will result in significant Wisconsin job losses, will reduce economic opportunity for younger and lower-skilled workers, will raise consumer prices and will not meaningfully reduce poverty or help the working poor. A recent analysis by the Employment Policies Institute (EPI) found that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour would kill as many as 27,937 jobs in Wisconsin. That estimate is consistent with a projection by the Congressional Budget Office that predicted 500,000 lost jobs nationwide if the federal minimum wage was increased to $10.10. So how would raising the minimum wage result in lost jobs? The answer is quite simple. Increasing the minimum wage will increase labor costs for employers. In turn, employers will respond by reducing their workforce, hiring fewer workers and reducing hours of work for existing employees. That translates into job loss and fewer economic opportunities for workers. WMC recently commissioned a statewide poll to test this issue and found 53% of likely voters initially support increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour. However, voters quickly abandon the proposal when told of the projected job losses. Support plummets to 39% when voters know raising the minimum wage kills jobs. In order to understand who will be harmed most by a minimum wage increase, it is important to understand who minimum wage earners are. The data show those who stand to lose the most from a minimum wage increase are younger and lower-skilled workers. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 1.1% of workers over age 25 earn the minimum wage. That's because typical minimum wage earners in America are teenagers living with their parents in middle-class families. They are not living in poverty nor are they earning a wage that is responsible for sustaining a family. Wisconsin is no exception. According to the EPI analysis, the average household income of Wisconsin families impacted by raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour is $58,812. That's actually higher than Wisconsin's median household income of $52,627. Clearly, the majority of minimum wage earners are not the working poor, but are instead young people entering the workforce with little experience and very few skills. They are people who desperately need entry-level jobs to begin the process of climbing the economic ladder by acquiring skills that lead to better jobs with higher wages. Unfortunately, increasing the minimum wage places the bottom rung of the economic ladder out of reach for many of these workers by eliminating entry-level positions that help workers gain the experience needed to advance in the workforce. Those who advocate a minimum wage increase as a means to reduce poverty are on the wrong side of history. Increasing the minimum wage has proven to be an ineffective policy in terms of reducing poverty. The U.S. Census Bureau recently released a report that found 59.7% of working-age people in poverty do not work. It is difficult to imagine how increasing the minimum wage will help lift people out of poverty when roughly 60% of those in poverty aren't even working in the first place. The empirical evidence also suggests raising the minimum wage simply does not impact poverty levels. Between 2003 and 2007, a total of 28 states increased their minimum wage beyond the level of the federal minimum wage. A study done in 2010 by Joseph Sabia and Richard Burkhauser focused on the minimum wage and poverty found no evidence the minimum wage lowered poverty rates in any of those 28 states. Increasing the minimum wage is a poorly conceived economic policy that would cost Wisconsin thousands of jobs. It misplaces focus on the small sliver of the workforce (2.5%) who earn the minimum wage while simultaneously making it harder for entry-level workers to get ahead. Politicians should instead focus on how we can improve our state's business climate to attract and retain high-wage jobs such as those in our manufacturing sector.

A new study claims the coronavirus can not only rob you of your taste and smell — it may leave men infertile and could be transmitted sexually. The study, published last month in JAMA, a monthly open-access medical journal published by the American Medical Association, found the presence of COVID-19 in 15% of semen samples collected. Researcher Dr. John Aitken likened it to the Zika virus. “It should be emphasized spermatozoa have a demonstrable capacity to carry viral infections from the male to the female reproductive tract, As happens during the sexual transmission of Zika, for example,” he told local San Antonio Fox 8. Zika virus is a mostly mosquito-borne virus that can also be sexually transmitted. The study also found that COVID-19 in human sperm “leads to a build-up of angiotensin II, which is a hormone that regulates kidney function and blood pressure. Increased levels of this hormone cause an immune response against the invading COVID-19 virus particles that increases the availability of reactive oxygen species that causes cell death… Prolonged exposure to elevated angiotenstin II levels can lead to cell death in sperm.” The study notes it could “ultimately result in a loss of male fertility.”",mixture,
46e9b5bb,"Two environmentalists have declared a “global climate emergency” after the Northern hemisphere jet stream was found to have crossed the equator, bringing “unprecedented” changes to the world’s weather patterns.

However other scientists dismissed their claims, with one describing their concern over wind crossing the equator as ""total nonsense"".  Scribbler and Beckwith said the anomalies were most likely precipitated by man-made climate change, which caused the jet stream to slow down and create larger waves.  Scribbler wrote in a post on his environmental blog on Tuesday: “It’s the very picture of weather-weirding due to climate change. Something that would absolutely not happen in a normal world. Something, that if it continues, basically threatens seasonal integrity.

5491b156,"Editor note and update: Since our original article was published, the Michigan secretary of state’s office has published a notice explaining that the Antrim county reporting mistake resulted from a user error, not a software error, and did not affect the election results or other counties or states. — ANTRIM COUNTY, MI -This is an update to an earlier report we filed about a computer “glitch” in Antrim County, Michigan which was reported to have only affected two Republican votes in the important swing state. However, the Detroit Free Press is reporting it was much, much worse. According to Antrim County Clerk Sheryl Guy, a Republican who ran unopposed and won a third term on Tuesday in a very strong Republican county, results on electronic tapes and a computer card were apparently accurate, however when the results were transcribed from the cards to a computer, something appeared to be wrong. In 2016, President Trump won the county with around 62% of the vote, compared to 33% for Hillary Clinton. The president outpolled Clinton by 4,000 votes. Wednesday morning after the election, results in the county showed Biden leading the president by around 3,000 votes with 98% of precincts reporting. Nothing to see here, right? Guy said that officials hadn’t checked the results prior to posting them, however later asked: “How could Democrats take over this county?” Clearly, that made zero sense. She said that officials were going over the tape of the results and inputting the numbers manually. Antrim uses Dominion voting equipment and doesn’t use cellular modems to transmit results from precincts to county offices. Rather, the data is transported by election officials, Guy said. She originally noted she was in talks with the company that maintains the equipment but said it could be the result of “human error.” Tom McMillin, a former state lawmaker from Oakland County told the Detroit Free Press that he is estimating that both President Trump and US Senate Candidate John James could realize between 4,000-5,000 votes each. Joe Gumm, a local news anchor with KXXV-TV tweeted about Michigan’s use of the same Election Source program and noted that 33 other counties used that same possibly compromised program to compile their vote totals. A political commentator, Dennis Lennox also questioned the vote totals from other counties in the state. “Trump did not lose #AntrimCounty in #Michigan. It is now confirmed that 32 other counties use the same software as Antrim County. He will get 6,000 plus votes out of Antrim. What about the other counties with the same software?” he tweeted. But according to AFP: Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s office released a statement on November 7 explaining what went wrong in Antrim, and how it was corrected. “The error in reporting unofficial results in Antrim County Michigan was the result of a user error that was quickly identified and corrected; did not affect the way ballots were actually tabulated; and would have been identified in the county canvass before official results were reported even if it had not been identified earlier,” the statement said. The software program, Election Source, worked properly and correctly counted votes, but the county missed an operation step, the statement said. This resulted in a miscommunication between the software and the county’s central election management system that was quickly corrected. “This was an isolated error, there is no evidence this user error occurred elsewhere in the state, and if it did it would be caught during county canvasses, which are conducted by bipartisan boards of county canvassers.” Antrim County Clerk Sheryl Guy is quoted on the county’s Facebook page: “We continue to work hard to ensure the integrity of the election results.” It will be interesting to see if the 138,339 vote dump that went to Biden under the cover of darkness early Wednesday morning , with The Federalist noting that “Biden somehow got all of the votes, and Trump got none, zero, in an overnight vote-dump.” An apparent “issue” with an election ballot counting program caused only two votes to be tallied for Republican candidates. The problem is being blamed on programming “infrastructure” and could be prevalent through other counties across the state of Michigan. Two major races are impacted by this “issue”: President, with Joe Biden now leading Donald Trump in the state; and United States Senate, with John James losing to Democratic incumbent Gary Peters. The problem was discovered Wednesday morning. Republican state legislator Triston Cole heard of the two votes cast for Representative Jack Bergman in his county that were counted, and responded: “I can guarantee that there were 6 [Bergman votes] in my immediate family alone.” Election results are no longer posted on the county’s website, and county authorities released an official statement: “Early this morning, the Antrim County Clerk, Sheryl Guy, became aware of apparently skewed results in the Unofficial Election Result tabulations. Since then, the Clerk’s Office has been reviewing the results and the multiple redundancies to search out any possible discrepancies. Staff is currently working with township officials and with Election Source, the company that provides the voting software programs and hardware.” Sheryl Guy reported that vote totals on printed tabulator tapes and totals counted by the election software did not match. The printed tabulated tapes from each precinct will now be counted manually as a result. There have been more than 16,000 votes cast in Antrim County. Michigan Republican party chairperson Laura Cox stated: “The irregularities reported this morning are incredibly troubling, especially given how close the election results are in Michigan.” On Wednesday, the Trump campaign filed suit against the state of Michigan, claiming poll observers had been denied access to polling sites. Trump campaign statement on #Michigan lawsuit pic.twitter.com/T7FSfp3MVA — Team Trump Text VOTE to 88022 @TeamTrump November 4, 2020 Like neighboring state Wisconsin, Michigan is claiming record voter turnout – a claim that draws both pride and skepticism. Reports and rumors of tons of ballots mysteriously appearing in the middle of the night have cast doubt on these turnout claims. Officially, Michigan is claiming that more than 5,260,000 citizens have voted. Challengers to election results for and against both parties have arrived at polling locations in the state. The TCF Convention Center is Detroit is ground zero for these groups, with about 50 challengers representing the Republicans. Other groups include the ACLU, NAACP, and union group representatives. Branden Snyder, executive director of Detroit Action, a housing and economic justice group stated: “We got a call that they needed more volunteers. Our goal is to make sure the process is fair and equal.” It is unknown on what authority Mr. Snyder used in his action afterwards, but when more than 100 opposing challengers arrived at the TCF Center, he turned them away for the day. In other election irregularities, the United States Postal Service USPS failed to comply with a federal court order, effectively ignoring the order. The USPS indicated that it couldn’t meet the 3 p.m. deadline set by U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan for facilities to sweep their buildings for mail-in ballots. As judge orders USPS to do twice-daily sweeps for remaining ballots, @APWUnational president says postal workers “moved heaven and earth” to count the record mail-in ballots “as a civic duty.” https://t.co/cB1cVIbEMq — Dinah Voyles Pulver @DinahVP November 6, 2020 The USPS also failed to comply with an order to allow election inspectors to inspect mail service in places like Detroit to make sure all mailed in ballots had been deposited at election drop-off sites. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy filed a response to Judge Sullivan’s order, indicating the service didn’t have enough inspectors to cover the task. USPS processed 150,000 ballots after Election Day, jeopardizing thousands of votes https://t.co/RDW0V0Nwpo — Bo Snerdley @BoSnerdley November 6, 2020 There will certainly be a discussion and possible sanctions over the “apparent lack of compliance with the Court’s order,” according to an after-action order filed by Sullivan. He did acknowledge the USPS postmaster’s efforts and would likely let them continue their operation in reference to the election.

John James campaign accusing local officials of voter suppression and election interference in Michigan Senate race November 5, 2020 DETROIT, MI- As Michigan continued to count ballots the day after Election Day, Republican John James’ Senate campaign accused local officials of impropriety, voter suppression, and election interference after incumbent Gary Peters picked up hundreds of thousands of votes overnight. John James Campaign Claims Irregularities in Michigan Senate Race https://t.co/10NvXMvL1D — James Woods @RealJamesWoods November 5, 2020 Fox News reported that James’ allegations came as chaos unfolded outside a vote tally room at the TCF Center in downtown Detroit where all mail-in absentee ballots were being collected. The chaos caused officials to place cardboard over the window in order to obstruct the public’s view as well as bar individuals from coming into the room. Stuart Sandler, a consultant for James’ campaign, who also observed the count as a volunteer lawyer, told Fox News that they believe there were “a lot of irregularities” throughout the process that must be looked into. Sandler said in a statement: “There were all kinds of chicanery, including ballots that came in reportedly in the middle of the night at 3:30 a.m. 35,000 ballots that were deceptively brought in.” He added: “There have been a lot of irregularities and lack of integrity. They’re not letting challengers in, they’re not letting them get food or water. When they do, they’re not letting them come back. There are all sorts of disruptions to the process.” John James campaign alleges irregularities, lack of integrity in Michigan vote counthttps://t.co/HniuNxpg8R — Fox News @FoxNews November 5, 2020 Up until the early mornings hours on Wednesday, November 4, James was holding a significant lead. Sandler has alleged that Mark Brewer, a former state Democratic chairman, organized the arrival of dozens of lawyers and activists to the TCF Center in order to “disrupt the process.” Sandler said: “There’s a lack of integrity there. The people of Michigan made their choice and they’ve been trying to disrupt the process and we’re reviewing our options.” Michigan’s Republican Senate Campaign for John James Alleges Election Interference https://t.co/VEgc0lZLQC — Dr. Carol M.

He said in a statement to the Associated Press: “This is the best absentee ballot counting operation that Detroit has ever had. They are counting ballots very efficiently, despite the obstructing tactics of the Republicans.” Still, a source close to James’ campaign said: “Poll challengers weren’t even able to get close enough to the ballot for the voter rolls to confirm that the ballots are credible, that people didn’t already vote.” .@GaryPeters laughed out loud when asked what he makes of @JohnJamesMI campaign allegations of irregularities with election results. Peters says James needs to accept his loss. pic.twitter.com/2FejVhqBgo — Malachi Barrett @PolarBarrett November 5, 2020 Previously, Michigan’s Secretary of State said she was expecting 2.5 million absentee ballots. However, by the morning of November 4th, a sourced alleged that that total increased to 5.6 million with the majority going up in places like Detroit. As the Trump campaign lawsuit is dismissed, Republican Senate candidate John James called for an investigation into election results, refusing to concede.https://t.co/P3iOiZLibO — The Michigan Daily @michigandaily November 5, 2020 Former State Sen. Patrick Colbeck, who is a registered poll watcher and was on the scene, told Fox News that what he witnessed was an “obfuscation and a complete lack of transparency.” He said in a statement: “We’re being expressly denied the access to the ballot count area, at the most critical time. And you know, it’s very telling.” He added: “I can tell you right now, it’s not a free and fair election and I’ve been watching this for quite a while. So, get the word out, Democrats are attempting to steal the election and the best way to go off and fight back on this is to let people know what’s happening.” Wow! It looks like Michigan has now found the ballots necessary to keep a wonderful young man, John James, out of the U.S. Senate. What a terrible thing is happening! — Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump November 4, 2020 The complaints from the James campaign follow the announcement from President Donald Trump’s campaign also alleging a lack of access to counting stations. Trump 2020 campaign manager, Bill Stepien, said in a statement: “President Trump’s campaign has not been provided with meaningful access to numerous counting locations to observe the opening of ballots and the counting process, as guaranteed by Michigan law.” _________ Want to make sure you never miss a story from Law Enforcement Today?

ef0f1066,"April 3, 2020 Hon. Bill de Blasio Mayor of the City of New York City Hall New York, NY 10007 Hon. Andrew M. Cuomo Governor of New York State NYS State Capitol Building Albany, NY 12224 Re: Meeting the need for isolation space for homeless New Yorkers Dear Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo: There is an urgent humanitarian crisis among homeless New Yorkers with the spread of COVID19. There are approximately 70,000 people sleeping in DHS, HRA, DYCD, and HPD shelters each night, including 19,000 single adults sleeping in Department of Homeless Services (DHS) congregate shelters and many more individuals sleeping in other congregate shelter systems. Thousands of homeless New Yorkers are still struggling to survive on the streets while contending with a drastic reduction in access to food, hygiene supplies, bathrooms, showers, and clothing. The economic upheaval brought on by the public health crisis is already leading to increased homelessness among the scores of precariously housed New Yorkers. Homeless adults, who are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and experiencing severe complications, are in desperate need of private places to self-isolate. In the week ending with March 21, 2020, only 16.8 percent of all hotel rooms in New York City were occupied, leaving an 83.2-percent vacancy rate. This means there are currently more than 100,000 vacant hotel rooms that could be used to temporarily house homeless New Yorkers. Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo: The undersigned organizations urge you to immediately use this resource in order to 1.) prevent the spread of COVID-19 among an extremely vulnerable homeless population, 2.) reduce the severity of illness for homeless people in need of a private space to care for themselves but who do not require hospitalization, and 3.) help prevent overcrowding and virus spread in hospital inpatient units and emergency departments due to a lack of appropriate discharge locations for homeless individuals. In addition to the need for hotel beds, you must drastically improve access to these beds and communication among shelter providers, hospital staff, and homeless individuals. As it stands, advocates and health care providers have witnessed an array of problems accessing the alreadylimited supply of approximately 200 isolation shelter beds: Individuals have been discharged back to congregate shelters while awaiting COVID-19 test results; hospitals have been unable to reach DHS for guidance on isolation shelter placements; and multiple individuals have been denied access to isolation shelter beds because they were not recently in the DHS shelter system (including youth, unsheltered individuals, and newly homeless people). All of these scenarios are worsening an already unspeakably deadly crisis. Furthermore, although DHS has set up a procurement process for providers to operate isolation shelter beds in hotels, they have crafted the contract requirements in such an onerous way as to preclude nearly all providers from bidding. According to the procurement standards, these contracts will require their nurses to supply their own personal protective equipment (PPE), which is nearly impossible for individual providers to do because of the present severely limited supply. As of April 1st, there were 136 cases of COVID-19 reported in 74 DHS shelters, in addition to seven homeless New Yorkers testing positive while living on the streets. On April 1st, 35 homeless people were hospitalized and five deaths had been reported. Because testing and access to treatment for people with mild illness is limited, the extent of illness and death among homeless New Yorkers is likely already far more extensive than what is officially reported – and similar to the experience of other vulnerable populations living in nursing homes and jails, it is growing daily. The latest federal stimulus bill provides $4 billion in Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) funds, and New York City is likely to receive hundreds of millions in aid as a result. ESG funds can be used to provide temporary emergency shelters such as hotels (waiving federal habitability and environmental review standards), staff costs, training, and hazard pay. Funding is available. There is no excuse not to act. All homeless individuals in congregate settings need the ability to practice safe social distancing and the City and State must provide resources to make this possible. To this end, the undersigned organizations call on Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo to immediately open thousands of hotel rooms to provide isolation for: • Every homeless individual on the streets; • All homeless individuals in shelters who are likely ill because they are experiencing symptoms or are COVID-19 positive; • All homeless persons in congregate settings who are highly vulnerable because of known or self-reported underlying health conditions, age, or other relevant conditions; and • Newly homeless individuals who require isolation because of symptoms or a positive diagnosis and who have not accessed DHS shelter in the past year or ever. We additionally call on Mayor de Blasio and the Department of Homeless Services to immediately reduce bureaucratic barriers to accessing isolation space by: • Allowing a “no wrong door” approach to accessing isolation shelters, including through outreach teams, shelter staff, or health care providers; • Relaxing requirements that staff be present at isolation hotels if necessary to open isolation beds quickly; and • Allowing congregate shelter providers and/or DHS to switch operations of individual congregate shelters to commercial hotels. Lastly, we urge Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio to prioritize any staff at isolation hotels and shelters where staff or shelter residents have tested positive for COVID-19 or have COVID19-like illnesses for access to incoming supplies of PPE.

68bf269b,"WISCONSIN — Trump’s failed COVID-19 response has crushed farmers in Wisconsin and across the country. Farmers have been dumping milk, setting their crops on fire, and euthanizing their livestock because there is no market for their products. All the while, millions of more Americans are going hungry because they lost their jobs.  But farmers were struggling long before coronavirus hit the United States. Trump’s chaotic trade wars, particularly with China, obliterated the markets Wisconsin farmers spent decades building in just a short few months. During this time Trump and his administration told Wisconsinites the pain would be “temporary,” that farmers were “over the hump,” and that small and medium-sized family farms should just get bigger if they want to survive.  Trump has never seen farmers as more than a political pawn critical to his reelection chances. He used their pain to push through a multi-billion dollar bailout program that was nothing more than a handout for large agricultural companies. After getting rolled by China on a trade deal that was a mere fraction of what he promised it would be, a recent news report confirms that Trump was never interested in bettering the lives of Wisconsin’s farmers and was simply looking out for his own political interests.  “Donald Trump crushed our farmers and the local economies they support because he only sees them as a bargaining chip, not human beings and Wisconsinites,” Democratic Party of Wisconsin spokesperson Philip Shulman said. “Trump has been a lapdog for China as he has rolled over for them at every turn. It’s been made clear by recent news reports that Trump gambled with farmers’ livelihoods because he thought it would be good for his reelection prospects. But after decimating these communities, they’re not willing to give him another four years — they know they can’t afford it.”  Wisconsin Examiner: Farms go from frying pan of trade wars to fire of COVID-19  Coxhead said trade policies under President Donald Trump…contributed significantly to the plight of Wisconsin farmers in the last few years. The federal government’s management of the COVID-19 pandemic has further endangered the country’s — and Wisconsin’s — position in the world economy, he added.  Wisconsin State Farmer: Economic recovery after pandemic will be slow for farmers due to trade and internet issues  He also said the Trump administration’s volatile relationship with China, one of the country’s biggest trading partners, is a cause for concern. And a widespread lack of high-speed internet access in rural areas is causing many rural economies to fall behind entirely. “The global economic recovery, which will outpace the United States, is not really going to benefit us all that well because the administration has turned its back on international trade,” Coxhead said.  Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Coronavirus has hit Wisconsin dairy farms especially hard — some farmers may even have to dump milk  Coronavirus is delivering a blow to Wisconsin agriculture…export markets are threatened by global trade unrest, and some farms may not make it through the spring. “The coronavirus outbreak has caused milk prices to drop down to unprofitable levels this spring…We also need to be prepared for the scenarios that would require our members to dump milk”…”or dispose of it in some other manner,”…the stimulus package won’t resolve long-term issues such as increased global competition and trade wars that may arise from countries closing their borders to curb the spread of COVID-19. The global pandemic has sent a shock wave throughout agriculture.","WisDems: Farmers have been crushed by Trump’s failed COVID-19 response, but he’s been dragging them down his entire presidency",mixture,
24fd8f3f,"Howl, beat your head against the wall, tear your hair and despair of this country. How can it be that nearly half the population thinks the reason people lost their jobs in the pandemic was due to their own underperformance? Just 31% attribute it to bad luck. Look around every city and town to see the shuttered shops, closed offices, boarded-up pubs, bars and restaurants, the blindingly obvious signs of the mass loss of jobs. Yet again those on the left are forced to confront some dismal realities about British public attitudes.  King’s College London’s deep research into how people feel about inequality is enough to all but extinguish political hope. It’s nice to know that Labour supporters are kinder than their Tory counterparts, but even so, a shocking 39% of Labour voters think it’s people’s own fault they lost their jobs, as this week the unemployment rate hit 5%, with worse to come.  Why does it keep shocking us, since the British people have most commonly voted in Conservative governments, with Labour crushed again and again? The Brexit vote came as the heaviest hammer-blow in living memory, followed by Boris Johnson’s triumph. This research shows that enthusing the public with a strong enough will to significantly reduce inequality requires exceptionally clever efforts of persuasion.  “There is no widespread appetite for change,” concludes the final section of this devastating report. What a blow to all of us who hope this crisis can be a 1945 moment, that the state’s massive intervention for the survival of so many might have whetted the appetite for more. “We should not expect a widespread reappraisal of the case for greater government intervention in the economy, despite the economic hardship wrought by the pandemic,” is the sobering conclusion.  Its lead author, Professor Bobby Duffy, long-time Ipsos Mori researcher on social attitudes, reminded me that there has been historic change for the better in attitudes on race, gender and sexuality, and that younger people are considerably more progressive than those who are old. But when I talked to him, he warned that attitudes can change again: “It doesn’t mean there won’t be backsliding.”  He warned on race that a fixed 13% have toxic racist attitudes. A quarter of people think Covid causing a rise in ethnic inequality wouldn’t be problem, though 67% say it would. Gender inequality ranks low as a concern, possibly because an older generation remember how much that has already improved.  Here’s the great political gulf, which interestingly falls along Brexit-related lines: two-thirds of Labour remainers believe the crisis justifies more state intervention, compared to only one in five Conservative leavers. The pandemic has barely shifted views, despite all that clapping for carers and key workers. While 82% of Labour remainers believed Britain was unequal before the coronavirus outbreak, that view is shared by just 53% of Conservative leavers. What should be done about it now? That depends on how the question is phrased: use the word “redistribution” and support for action is just 48%, but phrase it as “government should take measures to reduce differences in income levels” and support rises to 62%. Tax those who are very rich and companies, but not themselves, is roughly how that translates, as in much other polling.  The one question of disadvantage on which most agree is inequality of place. Some 61% agree that inequalities between more and less deprived areas are the most serious kind. Paul Johnson, head of the IFS, for whom this research forms part of its Deaton Review of Inequalities, finds this startling. He puzzles over whether people mean north and south, say Burnley versus Twickenham, or do they, he hopes, mean the divide between poor and rich districts everywhere? London, for example, may have grotesque wealth among City bankers, but it has the most poverty too, and he says, is by far the hardest hit by unemployment caused by the pandemic. Averages deceive wickedly.  “Take the real divide between graduates and non-graduates,” Johnson says. “After counting housing costs, a graduate in Burnley has the same income as one in Twickenham, but lots more graduates living in Twickenham give it a high average.” Can that simple fact be explained, so people realise that levelling up is not just big projects in the north, but levelling up low incomes everywhere?  These findings will warm the cockles of Conservative hearts, but present painful dilemmas for Labour. Tackling inequality is Labour’s great cause, but that may be a rebarbative word with too many voters. Paul Johnson recalls, “Tony Blair never mentioned inequality, yet with tax credits, did more than any government to ease poverty.” Blair spoke instead of “social exclusion”. Those who criticise Keir Starmer for his caution should study this report in depth.  Most depressing is how many people attribute success and failure only to hard work and ambition: people believe this is a meritocracy, not a system governed by birth and luck. Prof Duffy talked of how since the 1970s individual blame has replaced systemic injustice as people’s explanation for inequality. Britain was at its most equal in 1975, but with the blast of Thatcherism that took the lid off top earnings and saw bottom earnings fall back, came a dose of Americanised individualism. More than half the workforce belonged to a union in the 1970s, and they were vectors not just of power, but political education. Now only 23% are members and unions’ political influence is weak in public discourse. The collective is replaced with a warped idea of merit, disseminated by the right, deliberately ignoring the social injustices that predestine futures from birth.  Because we have to live in hope, and yet also cleave to realism, this research suggests the best way to engage voters with inequality is through locality and place. But whisper the word.",It's heartless to blame job losses on unemployed people – but it's how much of Britain thinks,mixture,

Their dramatic report on keeping that rise under 1.5 degrees C says the world is now completely off track, heading instead towards 3C. Keeping to the preferred target of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels will mean ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"". It will be hugely expensive - but the window of opportunity remains open.
After three years of research and a week of haggling between scientists and government officials at a meeting in South Korea, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has issued a special report on the impact of global warming of 1.5C. What could be wiped out by temperature rise What is climate change? The critical 33-page Summary for Policymakers certainly bears the hallmarks of difficult negotiations between climate researchers determined to stick to what their studies have shown and political representatives more concerned with economies and living standards. Despite the inevitable compromises, there are some key messages that come through loud and clear. ""The first is that limiting warming to 1.5C brings a lot of benefits compared with limiting it to two degrees. It really reduces the impacts of climate change in very important ways,"" said Prof Jim Skea, who co-chairs the IPCC. ""The second is the unprecedented nature of the changes that are required if we are to limit warming to 1.5C - changes to energy systems, changes to the way we manage land, changes to the way we move around with transportation."" What's the one big takeaway Graphic showing what is likely to be affected by different rises in temperature Presentational white space ""Scientists might want to write in capital letters, 'ACT NOW, IDIOTS,' but they need to say that with facts and numbers,"" said Kaisa Kosonen, of Greenpeace, who was an observer at the negotiations. ""And they have."" The researchers have used these facts and numbers to paint a picture of the world with a dangerous fever, caused by humans. We used to think if we could keep warming below two degrees this century, then the changes we would experience would be manageable. Not any more. This new study says that going past 1.5C is dicing with the planet's liveability. And the 1.5C temperature ""guard rail"" could be exceeded in just 12 years, in 2030. We can stay below it - but it will require urgent, large-scale changes from governments and individuals and we will have to invest a massive pile of cash every year, about 2.5% of global gross domestic product (GDP), the value of all goods and services produced, for two decades. Even then, we will still need machines, trees and plants to capture carbon from the air that we can then store deep underground - forever.
What can I do? No more beef? Five things you can do to help stop rising global temperatures The report says there must be rapid and significant changes in four big global systems: energy • land use • cities • industry But it adds that the world cannot meet its target without changes by individuals, urging people to: buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter and more locally sourced seasonal food - and throw less of it away • drive electric cars but walk or cycle short distances • take trains and buses instead of planes • use videoconferencing instead of business travel • use a washing line instead of a tumble dryer • insulate homes • demand low carbon in every consumer product Lifestyle changes can make a big difference, said Dr Debra Roberts, the IPCC's other co-chair. ""That's a very empowering message for the individual,"" she said. ""This is not about remote science; it is about where we live and work, and it gives us a cue on how we might be able to contribute to that massive change, because everyone is going to have to be involved.""
""You might say you don't have control over land use, but you do have control over what you eat and that determines land use. ""We can choose the way we move in cities and if we don't have access to public transport - make sure you are electing politicians who provide options around public transport."" The hottest that this location has ever been...map showing where temperature records were broken across the world this summer  Presentational grey line Five steps to 1.5 Global emissions of CO2 need to decline by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 Renewables are estimated to provide up to 85% of global electricity by 2050 Coal is expected to reduce to close to zero Up to seven million sq km of land will be needed for energy crops (a bit less than the size of Australia) Global net zero emissions by 2050 Presentational grey line How much will all this cost? It won't come cheap. The report says to limit warming to 1.5C, will involve ""annual average investment needs in the energy system of around $2.4 trillion"" between 2016 and 2035. Experts believe this number needs to be put in context. ""There are costs and benefits you have to weigh up,"" said Dr Stephen Cornelius, a former UK IPCC negotiator now with WWF. He says making big emissions cuts in the short term will cost money but be cheaper than paying for carbon dioxide removal later this century. ""The report also talks about the benefits as there is higher economic growth at 1.5 degrees than there is at 2C and you don't have the higher risk of catastrophic impacts at 1.5 that you do at two.""
Five things we have learned from the report Fast fashion is harming the planet, MPs say Vietnam's children and the fear of climate change How years compare with the 20th Century average 2019 10 warmest years10 coldest years What happens if we don't act?
The researchers say that if we fail to keep temperature rises below 1.5C, we are in for some significant and dangerous changes to our world. You can kiss coral reefs goodbye, as the report says they would be essentially 100% wiped out at two degrees of warming. Global sea-level will rise about 10cm (4in) more if we let warming go to 2C. That may not sound like much but keeping to 1.5C means that 10 million fewer people would be exposed to the risks of flooding. There are also significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat. ""We are already in the danger zone at one degree of warming,"" said Kaisa Kosonen, from Greenpeace. ""Both poles are melting at an accelerated rate; ancient trees that have been there for hundreds of years are suddenly dying; and the summer we've just experienced - basically, the whole world was on fire."" In 1980, the minimum sea ice extent was 7.7 million square kilometres. This year it was at 4.7 million square kilometres.2012 was the lowest year on record, when it was down to 3.6 million square kilometres - less than half what it was in 1980. Sea ice extent is much lower than in 1980. It reached its lowest level in 2012 Presentational grey line Is this plan at all feasible? Analysis by David Shukman, BBC science editor The countdown to the worst of global warming seems to have accelerated. Seriously damaging impacts are no longer on a distant horizon later this century but within a timeframe that appears uncomfortably close. By the same token, the report's ""pathways"" for keeping a lid on temperatures all mean that hard decisions cannot be delayed: a shift away from fossil fuels by mid-century coal phased out far sooner than previously suggested vast tracts of land given over to forests It's mind-bending stuff and some will say it's hopelessly unrealistic, a climate scientists' fantasy. So is any of it plausible? On the one hand, the global economy relies on carbon and key activities depend on it. On the other, wind turbines and solar panels have tumbled in price and more and more countries and states such as California are setting ambitious green targets. Ultimately, politicians will face a difficult choice: persuade their voters that the revolutionary change outlined in the report is urgently needed or ignore it and say the scientists have got it wrong. Is all this about saving small island states? The idea of keeping the global temperature rise to 1.5 is something very close to the hearts and minds of small island and low-lying states, which fear being inundated with flooding if temperatures go to two degrees. But over the three years that the report was in preparation, more and more scientific evidence has been published showing the benefits of staying close to 1.5C are not just for island nations in the Pacific. ""If you save a small island country, then you save the world,"" said Dr Amjad Abdulla, an IPCC author, from the Maldives. ""Because the report clearly states that no-one is going to be immune. It's about morality - it's about humanity."" How long have we got?Not long at all. But that issue is now in the hands of political leaders. The report says hard decisions can no longer be kicked down the road. If the nations of the world don't act soon, they will have to rely even more on unproven technologies to take carbon out ofthe air - an expensive and uncertain road. ""They really need to start work immediately. The report is clear that if governments just fulfil the pledges they made in the Paris agreement for 2030, it is not good enough. It will make it very difficult to consider global warming of 1.5C,"" said Prof Jim Skea. ""If they read the report and decide to increase their ambitions and act more immediately, then 1.5C stays within reach - that's the nature of the choice they face."" Campaigners and environmentalists, who have welcomed the report, say there is simply no time left for debate. ""This is the moment where we need to decide"" said Kaisa Kosonen. ""We want to move to clean energy, sustainable lifestyles. We want to protect our forests and species. This is the moment that we will remember; this is the year when the turning point happened.""

ff52ac93,"@amysherman1 Charlie Crist dismissed the idea of debating former state Sen. Nan Rich in a Democratic primary for governor. Here’s part of the transcript from a press gaggle at a Crist fundraiser at Greenspoon Marder law firm in Fort Lauderdale today: Q: “Will you be debating Nan Rich and if so do you think that will be in Broward and how many times do you expect to debate her?” Crist: “I don't.” Q: “You don't expect you'll be debating her?” Crist: “I'm not even thinking about it right now to be honest with you Tony [Man, Sun-Sentinel reporter.] I am focused on doing everything I can to help the people of Florida. And this is not a race really about candidates this is a race about people of our state -- about teachers, about law enforcement officers, firefighters, people that in my opinion have not been honored in the way they deserve to be honored....” Q: “The folks at Broward Days though think you should at least give it a shake to debate her. Especially Broward County is such a Democratic stronghold. They said they heard back from her campaign that she’d be willing to talk to you in a forum like that but no plans for that?” Crist: “No.” Crist was later asked about his stance on gay marriage, medical marijuana and Gov. Rick Scott’s proposed education budget. Crist: “Like the president, let’s start with that, I always supported civil unions. But I thought about it just as President Obama thought about it and I have come to the conclusion as the pope said himself ‘who am I to judge?’ I’ve always been a live and let live kind of guy that’s what’s in my heart....” Q: Did you ever publicly express your support for civil unions? Crist: “Yes.” (See Marc Caputo's analysis of Crist and civil unions here.) “On the issue of medical marijuana I am delighted that it is going to be on the ballot. I will vote for it. I think it is the right thing to do . If you have a physician who wants to prescribe medical marijuana for a patient who is suffering or has loss of appetite why would you be opposed to that?...” Q: ""What’s your thought on Common Core and on Scott’s education budget proposal yesterday . If you were governor would you fund education any differently than what he proposed yesterday?"" Crist: “Yeah and what he proposed when he first got there. Cutting education by $1.3 billion first year your first year as governor in state of Florida is ridiculous. It seems to me that trying to make some conversion in the election year and acting like you really care about education is laughable. I’ll just be straight up on this I just don’t think we can believe what he’s doing....,” he said, before slipping in a mention of the $1.7 billion Medicaid fine paid for by Scott’s former health care company. “If I get the opportunity because of the kindness of people of Florida to be involved in crafting an education budget....I’m a friend of education, always have been, always will be.” Q: ""Are you a supporter of Common Core?"" Crist: ""I am. I am.""","One in four girls or women left in period poverty, unable to afford sanitary products",mixture,

Don’t like wearing masks? Neither does Benjamin Glynn. But his refusal to wear one, on account of his failure to accept Singapore’s right to make them legally mandatory, saw him treated like a terrorist, as he tells RT.  The return leg of Benjamin Glynn’s daily commute turned his life upside down. Violent arrests, a prison sentence and time in a mental institution followed, but he vowed, “I would do it all again, I don’t regret anything.”  Living in Singapore, the Brit and his partner decided to return home with their two kids, booking flights for May 31. On keen runner Glynn’s final day at work, he went for a run with colleagues, followed by a few drinks. On the train home, a passenger videoed him not wearing a Covid mask – contrary to the local rules – and uploaded it to citizen journalism website Stomp.  Twenty-four hours later, he said, the police knocked on his door, demanding he come to the station. Glynn said, “I was happy to have a chat with them. I just thought it would be a conversation and I could go talk to them on the Monday, but they insisted they had to take me then. I objected to that, as it was so late; it was my daughter’s fifth birthday. But that’s when the nightmare began.”  According to Glynn, things turned ugly, and officers used batons which led to an ambulance being called as he was, he says, bleeding from his knees, elbows and shoulders.  Glynn recalls he spent the rest of the weekend in holding cells, which he described as “horrendous.” There was a concrete floor with no bedding and the lights were on constantly. Tiredness saw him hallucinating. He was finally granted bail.  The rest of the family flew to the UK, but he had to remain for a scheduled court date on July 23. And worse was to follow. He explained, “On July 19, five of them [police] came bursting into my room. I hid in the bathroom and recorded it on my phone. They gave me no choice and dragged me out.”  It was at this point things turned “quite dark,” Glynn claims. Bail was revoked; Glynn was back in the concrete police cells and then transferred to Changi prison, he said.  “I’m probably the only person in the history of Singapore who was happy about going to prison. I thought it can’t be any worse. But I still had no bed, it was a thin bamboo mat on the floor and itchy blanket,” he recalled.  Throughout all of this, Glynn insists that he had been clear – he admitted not wearing a mask on the train. But by now he was facing four charges; two of not wearing a mask, one for being a public nuisance and one for using threatening language to the police.  His account continues: “I admitted the whole time that it was me not wearing a mask. My defence was based on the law and who has jurisdiction over who. Is it a criminal action or is it a civil regulation breach?”  He accepts that employers have the legal right to tell their staff to wear masks, but does not agree the state can issue such demands legally. However, Glynn believed that, as a foreigner, he was exempt from Singapore's laws on wearing masks.  Several of his comments in court attracted attention, wrongly, he believes, giving the impression he wasn’t taking his predicament seriously. That, Glynn points out, was despite him attending some appearances in handcuffs, ankle bracelets and while chained to a chair.  He added, “I was quite aware of the law and what a crime is, and isn’t. But I just assumed that because Singapore was a British colony and the British set up their legal system, they would have some respect for common law. But it turns out they have absolutely zero recognition for the living man or living woman.”  Also on rt.com UK citizen set to be deported from Singapore after being handed prison sentence for refusing to wear a mask  Glynn alleges that asking the judge three times at one hearing to name which law states the public must wear masks seemingly angered the authorities, and that he was sent to the Institute of Mental Health for psychiatric assessment.  That was even tougher than Changi prison, where at least he was able to read and have personal items, the British expat said.  About that hospital stay, Glynn said “It was a horrible cell with a small grille, no windows, and I wasn’t allowed anything – no toilet paper, books or toothbrush. I just had two weeks of staring at a wall in the isolation ward, where the really poorly people with mental problems are.  “This is how they deal with people who challenge their legal system and government, but it’s not just in Singapore,” the Briton alleged, “I’m sure people in other countries have also been accused of having mental problems if they refuse to comply with the Covid regulations.”  Throughout the process, Glynn says, the judiciary offered him deals to plead guilty. But Glynn refused them all, explaining, “That’s not really how justice works, you don’t condemn someone to prison before the trial and sweet-talk them out of it.”  In the end, he was found guilty on all charges but had served enough time, so was deported a few days later. And even that became a saga, he says, because as he was brought to the gate in shackles, KLM – with whom Glynn had bought his original ticket – refused to take him. Singapore Airlines did the same, but the British High Commission said he could travel on British Airways.  The nightmare ended when the British jet’s wheels touched down at Heathrow, but Glynn feels he has been unfairly portrayed, particularly given that what sparked the secret video was him assisting an elderly gentleman onto the train, who had been struggling to breathe in his mask, he claims. After helping the man to a seat, Glynn was approached by others about not wearing one himself. “I’ve been treated in my opinion like some sort of terrorist and as a criminal,” he believes.  Also on rt.com Fukushima nuclear plant to construct UNDERSEA tunnel to release a million tons of treated water  While he would not wish to relive the incident, Glynn does feel it exposed bigger issues. He said, “It was unfortunate but I was standing up for my rights. I don’t believe in wearing masks. I stood up for my rights not to wear a mask, which is recognised in every major country apart from Singapore by the sounds of it. My case has highlighted a lot of unfairness in the Singapore legal system.”  And, while he claims he had been “psychologically tortured,” he’s keen to put it behind him, saying, “I’m not some crazy freedom fighter who wants to neglect my family or my career to keep on doing this.”  Glynn has been lambasted in some quarters but has also received lots of messages of support. So, what does he take away from this bizarre experience?  “I think it showed Singapore is not safe, and the police have no respect or regard for human rights,” he said.  After spending a week in the countryside since returning home, Glynn appears relaxed and ready to move on. He admitted, “It’s just so good to be back on English soil and the land of the free.”  Think your friends would be interested?

b1a03e65,Vitamins C and D Finally Adopted as Coronavirus Treatmen,"Flu season is in full swing, and once again reports are coming in that formerly healthy people are suffering serious harm or even dying from taking the flu shot. The fact that the annual flu shot is deadly and dangerous is not a fact even in dispute. But these facts are seldom, if ever, communicated to the American public before marketing the flu shot to the entire population, including those most vulnerable such as young babies and sick seniors, as the flu shot is marketed in retail pharmacy stores across the nation as if they are just as safe as buying a candy bar or pack of gum. As you will see below, the Department of Justice report on compensated cases for vaccine injuries and deaths in the U.S. Vaccine Court, submitted each three months to the federal government Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines (ACCV) under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, shows that millions of dollars are being spent for injuries and deaths due to the flu shot. As far as I know, Health Impact News is the only news source publishing this government data on compensated cases due to vaccine injuries and deaths. The December 6, 2018 meeting just concluded, and government attorney Catharine Reeves reported that there were 144 settlements for vaccine injuries and deaths the past 3 months, and 89 of those cases were listed in her report (see below). Some of these cases took more than 5 years to settle. Of those 89 cases compensated, 77 were for injuries and one death caused by the flu shot, making the flu shot the most dangerous vaccine in the United States, by far. The side effects of the flu shot include (among others): GBS – Guillain–Barré syndrome is a rapid-onset muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. The initial symptoms are typically changes in sensation or pain along with muscle weakness (paralysis), beginning in the feet and hands. This often spreads to the arms and upper body, with both sides being involved. TM – Transverse myelitis is an inflammation of both sides of one section of the spinal cord. This neurological disorder often damages the insulating material covering nerve cell fibers (myelin).Transverse myelitis interrupts the messages that the spinal cord nerves send throughout the body. ADEM – Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, or acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, is a rare autoimmune disease marked by a sudden, widespread attack of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord. CIDP – Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy is a neurological disorder — a condition that targets your body’s nerves. Symptoms aren’t the same for everyone, but you may be tired and have areas of numbness and pain. MS – Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease in which the insulating covers of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged. This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to communicate, resulting in a range of signs and symptoms, including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems. SIRVA – SIRVA stands for “Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration.” It can happen when a vaccine is injected into the shoulder too high or too deep and can cause several types of injuries. SIRVA can lead to intense, prolonged pain, limited range of motion, and shoulder-related injuries such as Adhesive Capsulitis or Frozen Shoulder Syndrome. Myasthenia gravis is a long-term neuromuscular disease that leads to varying degrees of skeletal muscle weakness. The most commonly affected muscles are those of the eyes, face, and swallowing. It can result in double vision, drooping eyelids, trouble talking, and trouble walking. Peripheral Neuropathy  is damage to or disease affecting nerves, which may impair sensation, movement, gland or organ function, or other aspects of health, depending on the type of nerve affected.

Global warming so fully occupies the thinking of some that there’s no room for information that will contradict their faith. If they’d only open their minds they’d see: The U.S. hasn’t warmed since 2005. America isn’t the entire world. But the alarmists gleefully point out regional heatwaves and the “hottest day on record” when cities endure summer scorchers. So let’s look at the data. The U.S. Climate Reference Network, “a . America isn’t the entire world. But the alarmists gleefully point out regional heatwaves and the “hottest day on record” when cities endure summer scorchers. So let’s look at the data. The U.S. Climate Reference Network, “a sophisticated climate-observing network specifically designed and deployed for quantifying climate change on a national scale,” has found there’s been no warming in the U.S. going back to 2005. In fact, says meteorologist Anthony Watts, the “little known data from the state-of-the-art” operation, “(which never seems to make it into NOAA’s monthly ‘state of the climate’ reports) show that for the past nine months, six of them were below normal .” The data also tell us 2019’s average has been cooler than 2005’s, the first year of the data set. Man’s carbon dioxide emissions are not burning down the Amazon. Empty-headed celebrities and activists have had quite a virtue-signaling feast tweeting photos from fires three decades ago, fires in Europe, and fires in the U.S. Yes, we’ve seen the claims that there are 80% more fires this year than last in South America, but we’ve also seen this from the New York Times: “The majority of these fires were set by farmers preparing Amazon-adjacent farmland for next year’s crops and pasture.” lockerdome.com is blocked Requests to the server have been blocked by an extension.

It was a turning point — the ‘greenhouse effect’ captured attention. But, in 1999 it became clear that carbon dioxide rose and fell after temperatures did . By 2003, we had better data showing the lag was 800 ± 200 years. CO2 was in the back seat.” Of course the climate crusaders have written at great length to tell us it’s all just a myth. This time, they say, the warming ( which is in doubt ) is caused by man. It just has to be. All those other warming periods, the alarmists tell us, can be explained by natural events, such as Earth’s orbit around the sun, which, incidentally, we have mentioned as one of many factors that influence climate changes Less than 5% of carbon dioxide emissions are produced by man. Web searches turn up what seems like an endless list of stories and blog posts reporting that CO2 levels in the atmosphere have reached or exceeded 415 parts per million. This has been almost universally treated as the tip of an imminent disaster, as man has pushed greenhouse gas emissions beyond a dangerous threshold. But has he? The United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change “agrees today’s annual human carbon dioxide emissions are 4.5 ppm (parts per million) per year and nature’s carbon dioxide emissions are 98 ppm per year,” says climate scientist Ed Berry. “Yet, the IPCC claims human emissions have caused all the increase in carbon dioxide since 1750, which is 30% of today’s total. “How can human carbon dioxide, which is less than 5% of natural carbon dioxide, cause 30% of today’s atmospheric carbon dioxide? It can’t .” Don’t like Berry’s numbers? Consider another set of figures from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report, which says that of the 750 gigatons of CO2 which travel through the carbon cycle every year, only 29 gigatons, or less than 4%, are produced by man. Is it possible for such a small portion to have such a great influence? Despite what the hysterics tell us, it’s an unanswered question. There are many other unanswered questions about climate, as well. An honest person would admit that they might remain unanswered forever.

More info  Last week, European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic outlined a set of measures to the UK aimed at resolving post-Brexit trade issues in Northern Ireland. These included eliminating 80 percent of regulatory checks and cutting customs processes on the movement of goods between Britain and the island of Ireland. But the European Union proposals have fallen a long way short of what the UK is demanding, which includes the removal of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the final arbitrator in any future trade dispute between the two sides.  Brussels officials are becoming increasingly impatient, and have implied there could be a trade war if the UK does not cave to some of the key problems Lord Frost has raised. However, a shocking report from Facts4EU.Org suggests the EU's ‘UK Treasure Island’ delivers a staggering 69 percent of the bloc's entire world trade surplus. In the 12 months to the end of August, the report revealed EU goods sales to the UK totalled a huge £252.2billion. EU purchases from the UK were just under half of that at £131.7billion, meaning the EU's trade surplus - the difference between exports and imports - stood at £120.5billion.  Brexit news: A potential trade war could have a huge impact on the EU  Brexit news: The EU's trade with the UK totalled £252.2billion  As a result, trade with the UK delivers 69 percent of EU’s entire trade surplus with the rest of the world, which totals £175.4billion, Facts4EU.org suggests. The group explained in its report: ""In the case of the United Kingdom’s relationship with the EU over the last 12 months, this difference is stark. ""The balance in favour of the EU is now over £120 billion pounds per annum. ""This is approximately 10 times the UK’s gross contribution to the EU when it was still a member state.

""The UK accounted for an astonishing 68.7 percent of this, or £120.5billion (€137.4biliion)."" The analysis also suggests, for the 12-month period, trade data shows the EU has been selling an average of £691million worth of goods to the UK every day.

00c29642,"Worst-case global heating scenarios may need to be revised upwards in light of a better understanding of the role of clouds, scientists have said.  Recent modelling data suggests the climate is considerably more sensitive to carbon emissions than previously believed, and experts said the projections had the potential to be “incredibly alarming”, though they stressed further research would be needed to validate the new numbers.  Modelling results from more than 20 institutions are being compiled for the sixth assessment by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is due to be released next year.  Compared with the last assessment in 2014, 25% of them show a sharp upward shift from 3C to 5C in climate sensitivity – the amount of warming projected from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide from the preindustrial level of 280 parts per million. This has shocked many veteran observers, because assumptions about climate sensitivity have been relatively unchanged since the 1980s.  “That is a very deep concern,” Johan Rockström, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said. “Climate sensitivity is the holy grail of climate science. It is the prime indicator of climate risk. For 40 years, it has been around 3C. Now, we are suddenly starting to see big climate models on the best supercomputers showing things could be worse than we thought.”  He said climate sensitivity above 5C would reduce the scope for human action to reduce the worst impacts of global heating. “We would have no more space for a soft landing of 1.5C [above preindustrial levels]. The best we could aim for is 2C,” he said.  Worst-case projections in excess of 5C have been generated by several of the world’s leading climate research bodies, including the UK Met Office’s Hadley Centre and the EU’s Community Earth System Model.  Timothy Palmer, a professor in climate physics at Oxford University and a member of the Met Office’s advisory board, said the high figure initially made scientists nervous. “It was way outside previous estimates. People asked whether there was a bug in the code,” he said. “But it boiled down to relatively small changes in the way clouds are represented in the models.”  The role of clouds is one of the most uncertain areas in climate science because they are hard to measure and, depending on altitude, droplet temperature and other factors, can play either a warming or a cooling role. For decades, this has been the focus of fierce academic disputes.  Previous IPCC reports tended to assume that clouds would have a neutral impact because the warming and cooling feedbacks would cancel each other out. But in the past year and a half, a body of evidence has been growing showing that the net effect will be warming. This is based on finer resolution computer models and advanced cloud microphysics.  “Clouds will determine humanity’s fate – whether climate is an existential threat or an inconvenience that we will learn to live with,” said Palmer. “Most recent models suggest clouds will make matters worse.”  In a recent paper in the journal Nature, Palmer explains how the new Hadley Centre model that produced the 5+C figure on climate sensitivity was tested by assessing its accuracy in forecasting short-term weather. This testing technique had exposed flaws in previous models, but in the latest case, the results reinforced the estimates. “The results are not reassuring – they support the estimates,” he wrote. He is calling for other models to be tested in a similar way.  “It’s really important. The message to the government and public is, you have to take this high climate sensitivity seriously. [We] must get emissions down as quickly as we can,” he said.  The IPCC is expected to include the 5+C climate sensitivity figure in its next report on the range of possible outcomes. Scientists caution that this is a work in progress and that doubts remain because such a high figure does not fit with historical records.  Catherine Senior, head of understanding climate change at the Met Office Hadley Centre, said more studies and more data were needed to fully understand the role of clouds and aerosols.  “This figure has the potential to be incredibly alarming if it is right,” she said. “But as a scientist, my first response is: why has the model done that? We are still in the stage of evaluating the processes driving the different response.”  While acknowledging the continued uncertainty, Rockström said climate models might still be underestimating the problem because they did not fully take into account tipping points in the biosphere.  “The more we learn, the more fragile the Earth system seems to be and the faster we need to move,” he said. “It gives even stronger argument to step out of this Covid-19 crisis and move full speed towards decarbonising the economy.”","Climate worst-case scenarios may not go far enough, cloud data shows",mixture,
648e6bc4,"Despite recent attempts to paint the United States as a major global polluter, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. is among the cleanest nations on the planet.  In the most recent WHO report on air pollution, the United States was listed as one of the countries with the cleanest air in the world, significantly cleaner in fact than the air in Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the UK, Japan, Austria and France.  While France and other G7 countries lamented the U.S. exit from the Paris climate accord, America’s air is already cleaner than that of any other country in the G7, except Canada with its scant population.  Following standard practice, the WHO measures air pollution by the mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameter. These are the particles that cause diseases of all sorts and are responsible for most deaths by air pollution.  According to the WHO, exposure to particulate matter increases the risk of acute lower respiratory infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, stroke and lung cancer.  The report, which analyzed the “annual median concentration of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or less (PM2.5) for both urban population and rural and urban population” found that the United States was one of the most pollution-free nations in the world.  The annual mean concentrations of particulate matter in the air range from less than 10 to over 100 µg/m3, the report states. At the very low end of the spectrum, the United States has a concentration of just 8, while China has a concentration more than seven times higher at 59, India at 66, Egypt at 101 and Saudi Arabia with the worst air pollution at 127.  “The mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameter is a common measure of air pollution,” the WHO states.  The WHO report is corroborated by a series of other such studies on air and water pollution.  In a recent list of the 25 cleanest cities in the world, the only country to boast three cities among the cleanest on the planet was the United States of America, with Chicago coming in second place, Honolulu coming in fourth, and Portland, OR, coming in sixteenth. Unsurprisingly, no cities from China, Russia or India made the list at all.  Similarly, another list of the 15 most polluted cities in the world featured three cities from China, three cities from Saudi Arabia, and a whopping seven cities from India. No U.S. city made the list.  A third list, ranking the ten cleanest and ten most polluted cities in the world, placed two U.S. cities on the list of cleanest cities on the planet. The list of the most polluted cities in the world was led by two cities from China followed by two more cities from India. Two Russian cities also made the list. Again, no U.S. cities were found here.  With such relatively clean air throughout America, how can even reputable news agencies like Reuters continue spreading the well-worn lie that the United States is one of the “biggest polluters” in the world?  Rather than follow the time-tested practice used by the World Health Organization, which measures levels of disease-causing pollutants that get into people’s lungs, some have played a shell game, swapping a new measure of “pollution” based solely on emissions of carbon dioxide.  The problem with this ploy is that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and it is dishonest to say it is. CO2 is colorless, odorless and completely non-toxic. Plants depend on it to live and grow, and human beings draw some into their lungs with every breath they take to no ill effect whatsoever.  Growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses, raising levels to three times that of the natural environment, to produce stronger, greener, healthier plants.  Current levels of carbon dioxide concentration in the environment are substantially lower than they have been during earlier periods in the planet’s history. Without human intervention, the concentration of CO2 has climbed as high as 7,000 parts per million (ppm) in prior eras, whereas at present the concentration is just over 400 ppm.  Some experts, such as UN climate scientist Dr. Indur Goklany, have defended rising CO2 levels as a good thing for humanity. Goklany has argued that the rising level of carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere “is currently net beneficial for both humanity and the biosphere generally.”  “The benefits are real, whereas the costs of warming are uncertain,” he said.  While the United States must remain vigilant to keep the level of real, dangerous pollutants to a minimum, it may take some consolation in the fact that among G7 nations, it has the cleanest air of all.

9b14da53,"Junior doctors in England have overwhelmingly voted in favour of going on strike in their dispute with ministers over a new contract.  Some 98% voted in favour of a full strike and 99% in favour of action just short of a full strike.  The first walk-out will start on 1 December with another two dates earmarked for later in the month.  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the doctors' decision was very, very disappointing news.  And he rejected calls for talks to be held at conciliation service Acas, although he would not rule it out completely.  Study after study has shown that our mortality rates at weekends are too high, he said. media captionIn full: Jeremy Hunt interview with Laura Kuenssberg  We put forward a very fair offer for doctors, which will see pay go up for three-quarters of junior doctors. We wanted to talk about this to them, but in the end they have chosen to strike so we will have to put in contingency plans.  He also said that the government's offer had been misrepresented. 'Unsafe contract'  The British Medical Association BMA said it was inevitable disruption would be caused to patients as a result of the strikes, but maintained it had been left with no choice as the contract was unsafe.  The action is likely to lead to the cancelling and rescheduling of thousands of routine appointments, tests and operations with the NHS forced to prioritise emergency cases.  The union has asked the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service Acas to get involved to offer independent arbitration - something the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which normally stays out of politics, has said it supports.  The dates for industrial action are:      08:00 GMT 1 December to 08:00 GMT 2 December junior doctors to staff emergency care     08:00 GMT to 17:00 8 December full strike     08:00 GMT to 17:00 16 December full strike  The BMA balloted just over 37,700 members - over two-thirds of the workforce - and 76% took part in the ballot.  Paris attacks: The young doctor who treated first casualties line What will happen in a strike? Doctorimage copyrightPA  Services will be disrupted, make no mistake about that. But the British Medical Association argues the aim of doctors taking part will not be to maximise that - as is the goal in many other industrial disputes.  On the first day of action that has been earmarked, junior doctors will still staff emergency care. On the other two dates, they will walk out in the knowledge there will be other medics - consultants, staff doctors and locums - that can plug the gaps.  Whether that will be enough for hard-pressed emergency services will be argued over ahead, during and after any walkout.  What is certain, though, is routine services will suffer. Hip operations, knee replacement and routine clinics will have to be cancelled.  In fact, as happened the last time doctors took action in 2012, over pensions, expect hospitals to start rearranging services in advance. Want to know more about the dispute?      The junior doctors row explained     What exactly do junior doctors do?     A nightmare for the NHS and patients     How does your job compare?     NHS v ministers: A case of deja vu?  line  The vote comes after thousands of doctors have taken part in a series of protests in recent months in the contract dispute.  Talks broke down last year, and ministers have since said they will impose the new contract from next year.  As the ballot papers went out a fortnight ago, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt made a last ditch attempt to persuade doctors to accept the offer.  He wrote to all the doctors in the country with a fresh offer.  It included a promise of an 11% rise in basic pay, but the BMA said this was misleading as it was offset by curbs to other elements of the pay package, including unsociable hours payments.  Ministers have promised to protect pay for the first three years of the deal.  But the BMA has said there are insufficient safeguards to stop hospitals overworking doctors and they could lose out financially in the long term. Junior doctors row  55,000  junior doctors in England  37,700  balloted over industrial action      £3.1bn spent on junior doctor pay currently      11% rise in basic pay offered      25% cut in weekly hours that attract a premium unsociable hours payment  Source: Department of Health and BMA Science Photo Library  After the result of the ballot was announced, BMA leader Dr Mark Porter said: We regret the inevitable disruption that this will cause but it is the government's adamant insistence on imposing a contract that is unsafe for patients in the future, and unfair for doctors now and in the future, that has brought us to this point.  Our message to him is that junior doctors have today made their views perfectly clear but that it is still possible to get back around the negotiating table to deliver a contract that is safe for patients, contains the necessary contractual safeguards to prevent junior doctors being overworked and properly recognises evening and weekend work.  Meanwhile, Labour shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander has written to the prime minister to ask him to intervene, saying the profession had lost confidence in Mr Hunt. She also wants to see independent arbitration.  The letter - seen by the BBC - says: With the NHS facing its most difficult winter in recent memory, and the prospect of industrial action now looming, it is imperative that urgent steps are taken to resolve this dispute. Graphic  Roger Goss, of the campaign group Patient Concern, criticised the way both sides had handled the dispute but said doctors should not go on strike.  This is the worst news for patients in the history of the NHS. What happened to the promise that the interests of patients are paramount and we put patients first?  Any honourable doctor with a genuine vocation who wants to preserve the high esteem which the medical profession currently enjoys will refuse to cause suffering inherent in a full-scale walk-out.  Scotland and Wales have said they do not want to introduce the contract changes, while Northern Ireland has yet to make a decision.  ",Junior doctors row: 98% vote in favour of strikes,mixture,

068d0644,"For immediate release:  October 2, 2013  For more information:  Barth E. Bracy, Executive Director  Office: 401 521-1860 / Mobile: 401 225-8646  Why is HealthSource RI concealing Governor Chafee's victory for abortion-on-demand?  Providence, RI-The Rhode State Island Right to Life Committee RIRTL wonders why HealthSource RI is concealing Governor Lincoln Chafee's hard-fought and unprecedented victory for government-subsidized abortion-on-demand and for mandatory abortion fees in Rhode Island's Obamacare exchange.  With HealthSource RI now operating, it appears that the 28 plans available for sale on the exchange 16 for small businesses, 12 for individuals and families fail to disclose the fact that they all include coverage for abortion-on-demand, that is, for abortions other than those in the cases of rape or incest, or where the life of the mother would be endangered.  According to RIRTL executive director Barth E. Bracy, We have been fighting in the General Assembly since 2011 trying to blunt Chafee's extreme agenda on government subsidies for insurance plans that cover abortion-on-demand and, more recently, his imposition of a mandatory abortion fee on all Rhode Island individuals, families, and businesses who wish to purchase health insurance through HealthSource RI. Chafee's audacious yet constitutionally dubious end-run around the General Assembly has won the day for him and his fellow abortion-industry colleagues on the board of NARAL. Why are they trying to conceal their hard-fought victory?  Is Chafee worried, wonders Bracy that the lack of disclosure violates the provision of the Affordable Care Act requiring plans that cover elective abortion to provide notice to enrollees as part of the summary of benefits and coverage explanation? Is he concerned that his exchange violates the provision of the Affordable Care Act requiring the availability of at least one exchange-plan that does not provide coverage for elective abortion? Is he anxious that his administration might somehow have violated the provision of the Affordable Care Act that insurers cannot be required to provide coverage for elective abortion in their exchange-plans? Or is he simply aware that many Rhode Islanders would strongly disapprove of his machinations?  Under HealthSource RI, pro-life individuals, families, nonprofits, and small businesses are not free to purchase health insurance without paying a mandatory abortion fee, and thereby seriously violating their conscience and their principles. The Rhode Island State Right to Life Committee believes the citizens of Rhode Island deserve protection from this unprecedented government coercion and answers as to whether Chafee's mandatory abortion fee violates the law.

1393bc27,"I’m not sure the whole thing isn’t crazy, this climate change’ … environmentalist James Lovelock near his home on the Dorset coast. Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian Fracking is great, the green movement is a religion, his dire predictions about climate change were nonsense – and robots don’t mind the heat, so what does it matter? At 97, the creator of Gaia theory is as mischievous and subversive as ever James Lovelock’s parting words last time we met were: “Enjoy life while you can. Because if you’re lucky, it’s going to be 20 years before it hits the fan.” It was early 2008, and the distinguished scientist was predicting imminent and irreversible global warming, which would soon make large parts of the planet uninhabitably hot or put them underwater. The fashionable hope that windfarms or recycling could prevent global famine and mass migration was, he assured me, a fantasy; it was too late for ethical consumption to save us. Before the end of this century, 80% of the world’s population would be wiped out. His predictions were not easy to forget or dismiss. Sometimes described as a futurist, Lovelock has been Britain’s leading independent scientist for more than 50 years. His Gaia hypothesis, which contends that the earth is a single, self-regulating organism, is now accepted as the founding principle of most climate science, and his invention of a device to detect CFCs helped identify the hole in the ozone layer. A defiant generalist in an era of increasingly specialised study, and a mischievous provocateur, Lovelock is regarded by many as a scientific genius. James Lovelock speaking in 2014: ‘We should give up on saving the planet’ Guardian Eight years after our previous encounter, he appears to have aged not one bit. At 97, he’s conceived a beautifully illustrated book of essays described as a “tool kit for the future”, The Earth and I, and written the introduction and conclusion; he goes walking every day, his hearing is perfect, his focus forensic and his memory unimpaired. “Yes, why not? I’m writing a fiction book at the moment. It’s tremendous fun, you know.” He applies his holistic philosophy of science to his own health. “I’m a firm believer that if you don’t use it, you lose it – and if you do a lot of walking, and if you use your muscles quite a bit, your brain seems to work as well. You’ve got to look at the whole system, not just bits of it.” What has changed dramatically, however, is his position on climate change. He now says: “Anyone who tries to predict more than five to 10 years is a bit of an idiot, because so many things can change unexpectedly.” But isn’t that exactly what he did last time we met? “I know,” he grins teasingly. “But I’ve grown up a bit since then.” Lovelock now believes that “CO2 is going up, but nowhere near as fast as they thought it would. The computer models just weren’t reliable. In fact,” he goes on breezily, “I’m not sure the whole thing isn’t crazy, this climate change. You’ve only got to look at Singapore. It’s two-and-a-half times higher than the worst-case scenario for climate change, and it’s one of the most desirable cities in the world to live in.” There are various possible explanations for his change of heart. One is that Lovelock is right, and the models on which his former predictions were based were fatally flawed. Another is that his iconoclastic sensibility made revision irresistible. An incorrigible subversive, Lovelock was warning the world about climate change for decades before it began to pay attention, and just when the scientific consensus began to call for intervention to prevent it, he decided we were already too late. But there is a third explanation for why he has shifted his position again, and nowadays feels “laid back about climate change”. All things being equal – “and it’s only got to take one sizable volcano to erupt and all the models, everything else, is right off the board” – he expects that before the consequences of global warming can impact on us significantly, something else will have made our world unrecognisable, and threaten the human race. Lovelock in 1991, with one of his books on Gaia theory.  Lovelock maintains that, unlike most environmentalists, he is a rigorous empiricist, but it is manifestly clear that he enjoys maddening the green movement. “Well, it’s a religion, really, you see. It’s totally unscientific.” He was once invited to Buckingham Palace, where he told Princess Anne: “Your brother nearly killed me.” Having read that Prince Charles had installed grass-burning boilers at Highgrove, Lovelock had tried one in his house. “It’s supposed to smoulder and keep the place warm; but it doesn’t, because it goes out, and clouds and clouds of smoke come out.” He giggles. “Princess Anne thought this was hilariously funny.” Lovelock had been trying to heat his old mill in Devon, where he lived for more than 35 years, inventing contraptions in a workshop that resembled a Doctor Who set. He and his wife recently packed up his life’s work and downsized to a remote cottage on Chesil Beach in Dorset, after the bill to heat the mill for just six months hit £6,000. “I remember George Monbiot took me up on it and wrote that it was impossible, that I had to be lying. But I wasn’t lying, I’ve got the figures.” Monbiot doesn’t quite accuse him of lying, in fairness; just of “talking rubbish” and “making wild statements”. In any case, he says that in the US he found he could heat a house for six months, in temperatures of -20C (-4F), for just £60. As a result, he has withering contempt for environmentalists’ opposition to fracking. “You see, gas in America is incredibly cheap, because of fracking,” he says. But what about the risk of triggering earthquakes? He rolls his eyes. “Sure enough, that’s true, there will be an increase. But they’re tiny little tremors, they would be imperceptible. The only trouble is that you can detect them. The curse of my life has been that I’ve spent a lot of time inventing devices that are exceedingly sensitive. And the moment somebody can detect something, they’re going to attach a number to it, and then they make a fuss about it.” He chuckles, then pauses. “I’m not anti-green in the sense that I’m in favour of polluting the world with every damn thing we make. I think we’ve got to be careful. But I’m afraid, human nature being what it is, the thing gets exaggerated out of all proportion, and the greens have behaved deplorably instead of being reasonably sensible.” Even more heretical than his enthusiasm for fracking is Lovelock’s passionate support for nuclear power. But, like fracking, he says, it offers only “a stopgap” solution. “Because in the long term, they’ll use up all the uranium.” How long would that take? He pauses to do some quick mental arithmetic, as casually as I might tot up how many pints of milk to grab from Sainsburys. “Let’s see … I think uranium that is affordable to extract would last about 50 years, something in that range. It might be 100. When you’ve used all that up, you go to thorium, and that would last you three times as long as uranium – so, shall we say, about 200 years?” The most sensible energy solution would be to cover 100 sq miles of the Sahara in solar panels. “It would supply the whole of Europe with all the energy they needed,” but it won’t happen “because it would be so easy for terrorists to go and bugger it up”. So for now, nuclear energy is the only viable option. But all this, he clarifies cheerfully, is more or less academic. “Because quite soon – before we’ve reached the end of this century, even – I think that what people call robots will have taken over.” Robots will rule the world? “Well, yes. They’ll be in charge.” In charge of us? “Yes, if we’re still here. Whether they’ll have taken over peacefully or otherwise, I have no idea.” For robots, time happens a million times faster than it does for us. That’s rather wonderful in a way, isn’t it?
He isn’t alone in this view: the influential philosopher Nick Bostrom has persuaded many people that artificial intelligence poses a real threat to the future of humanity; Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, among others, have called for urgent research to mitigate the risks. Still, when Lovelock outlines this vision, his tone is so matter-of-fact that for a moment I wonder if he’s joking. He isn’t. “We’re already happily letting computers design themselves. This has been going on for some time now, particularly with chips, and it’s not going to be long before that’s out of our hands, and we’ll be standing aside and saying, ‘Oh well, it’s doing a good job designing itself, let’s encourage it.’” Computers will develop independent volition and intuition (“To some extent, they already have”) and become capable of reproducing themselves, and of evolving. “Oh yes, that’s crucial. We’ll have a world where Darwin’s working.” Darwinism doesn’t work now? “Oh no, we’ve temporarily turned Darwinism backwards. I mean, we preserve the ones that would not have survived.” Lovelock at the University of Houston in Texas in 1962 He pauses, and adds quickly: “Don’t let’s get dangerous on this one. I don’t want this appearing in the Guardian that he just wants all the dumb and the lowlifes wiped out.”
Lovelock doesn’t sound the least bit troubled by the prospect of robots taking over, though, despite the possibility that they will destroy us. “Once they become at all established anywhere, that’s the end, because to robots time happens one million times faster – that’s a fairly exact figure – than it does to us. That’s rather wonderful in a way, isn’t it?” I ask him to explain. “Well, for a neuron to travel a foot takes a microsecond – which is fairly fast. But for electrons to go down a foot of wire takes a nanosecond. It’s a million times faster, as simple as that. So to a robot, once fully established in that new world, a second is a million seconds. Everything is happening so fast that they have on earth a million times longer to live, to grow up, to evolve, than we do.” It is possible, he goes on, that human beings may fuse with robots to become a blend of robotic and human tissue (“That’s one route”), but the likelier scenario will be pure robots. Why does he think we’ll go for all-out robots? He shoots me an amused look. “I don’t think we will. I think that they will – that’s the key thing here.” The implications for climate change are obvious. “The world that they’re going to be comfortable in is wildly different from the one that we feel comfortable in. So once they really get established, they will – with regret – start losing organic life.” Will they care about rising temperatures? “They won’t give a fourpenny fuck about the temperature, because to them the change will be slow, and they can stand quite a big change without any fuss. They could accommodate infinitely greater change through climate change than we can, before things get tricky for them. It’s what the world can stand that is the important thing. They’re going to have a safe platform to live in, so they don’t want Gaia messed about too much.”
Notwithstanding his caveats about the dangers of predictions, his confidence in the robotic future he describes is “fairly high. Yes, all sorts of things can happen, but that’s the intuitive feeling I have”. As for our interaction with robots: “Well, it’s going to be very peculiar.” In the classic Frankenstein tradition, will humanity not understand what it has created until it’s too late? “Well, too late is the wrong word. Let’s say, until it has happened.” The phrase “too late”, he explains, implies regret – but whereas the robots might see no use for our continued existence, “maybe we’ve got some special property that they will appreciate. But then, don’t forget, their timescale is a million times different from ours. They’d have a lot of trouble talking to us.” In the same sense that we have trouble talking to ants? “Oh no, it’s much worse than that. It’s really more like us talking to a giant redwood tree.

In a city our parks and gardens are its lungs and life would be a greyer place without them. Yet Labour along with similar proposals from the Greens and Lib Dems proposes to introduce a Land Value Tax LVT – hereafter called the “garden tax”, which will be based on three per cent of the value of land for each property. For many homeowners this could represent a massive increase in their annual tax bill and force the sale of gardens in order to reduce bills. Grasping property developers will be keen to grab the land for new developments. It is unthinkable that this should be allowed to happen: the destruction of precious gardens that bring happiness and tranquillity as a means of paying for Labour’s irresponsible promises to the electorate.

b100f125,"Cash-strapped schools are spending a record £1.3bn on supply staff as a result of a chronic shortage of teachers in the nation’s classrooms caused by the failure of the government’s recruitment policies, according to Labour.  At a time when schools are struggling with diminishing budgets and rising costs, the Labour party says spending on supply teachers has gone up by more than a quarter over two years as headteachers struggle to plug staffing gaps.  Labour analysis of new official government figures published last week shows spending on supply teachers – who are called in to cover in the absence of a member of staff – has gone up by almost £300m over two years, with the average amount spent by academies and free schools rising by 42% in a single year.  The figures come days after the scale of the teacher recruitment crisis was laid bare for MPs on the education select committee, who heard that schools were being forced to spend vast sums of money on recruitment agencies to help them fill vacancies.  Where schools would once have placed advertisements in the trade press, which would normally have attracted a selection of strong candidates, headteachers are spending up to £10,000 on agency fees to fill a single vacancy. Others are making expensive trips abroad to recruit.  Lucy Powell, the shadow education secretary, blamed the government’s failure to recruit enough trainee teachers, saying ministers had missed their target for teacher recruitment for the fourth year running.  “With chronic shortages of teachers in our schools, this government is risking the education of the next generation. Ministers have mishandled teacher training, putting applicants off and constantly talked down the profession, causing thousands of teachers to quit.    “As a result, half of all schools had unfilled positions at the start of this year and are being forced to turn to unqualified staff, temporary supply teachers, non-specialists and larger class sizes to try to plug the gaps.  “Nothing is more important for raising standards and improving social mobility than ensuring there are excellent teachers in every school. The government urgently needs to get a grip on this problem, which is affecting the education of our children, and start to take it seriously.”  A Conservative party spokesman accused Labour of scaremongering. “Lucy Powell has not had one positive thing to say about England’s schools and teaching profession since she became shadow education secretary,” the spokesman said.  “Despite many opportunities to laud the achievements of teachers and schools across England, which has seen 1.4 million more pupils in good or outstanding schools since 2010, Labour continue to scaremonger. Rather than recognise that the number and quality of teachers in our schools is at a record high, they talk down the teaching profession.”  Labour says the crisis is being worsened by record numbers of teachers leaving the profession, with 50,000 quitting this year alone – more than those who joined – and worse may be to come. A recent YouGov survey suggested that more than half of teachers 53% are considering giving up in the next two years. The main reasons given were “volume of workload” 61% and “seeking a better work/life balance” 57%.  However, the government claims that the number and quality of teachers is at a record high, with 1,000 more graduates training to teach in secondary schools than a year ago, and the number of former teachers returning to the classroom up from fewer than 15,000 in 2011 to more than 17,000 in 2014. Spending on supply teachers is up, the government says, because of rising pupil numbers.  A spokesperson for the Department for Education DfE said: “It is completely misleading to suggest there are chronic shortages of teachers or that a record number of teachers have ‘quit’ the profession – our increased spending on supply teachers simply reflects our increased total spending in response to rising pupil numbers.  “The overall teacher vacancy rate is 0.3% and has remained under 1% for the past 15 years. The 49,120 that left the profession between November 2013 and November 2014 includes those that left through death or retirement.”  Responding to the Labour figures, Russell Hobby, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the research echoed the NAHT recruitment survey, published last week, which showed that almost eight out of 10 school leaders are finding recruitment a problem.  “Supply teachers play a crucial role in addressing short-term gaps in teacher numbers, but an increasing number of school leaders are having to rely on them more frequently and for longer periods than in the past. These figures show an underlying problem in recruitment and retention that the government needs to address.”  There is a recognition from the government and those in the profession that as the economy picks up, competition to recruit graduates will increase. The government is offering bursaries and scholarships worth up to £30,000 tax-free, but many in the profession fear that the workload combined with pay and conditions make teaching unattractive.    The DfE spokesperson said supply teachers perform an important and valuable role. “Schools are best placed to make staffing decisions to reflect their individual needs. It is up to headteachers and governors to decide who is required for the job and this includes how best to cover absences.”  Of the just under 50,000 people who left the profession between November 2013 and November 2014, the DfE said more than 13,000 had either died or retired. “Our figures also show that the vast majority 72% of newly qualified teachers are still in post after five years,” the spokesperson said.",Schools spending £1.3bn on supply teachers as staff shortage intensifies,mixture,
c46da247,"The majority of UK graduates are being forced into jobs which do not need their talents, according to a newly-published study.  Research for the CIPD Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, which represents human resource managers, shows 58.8 per cent of UK graduates have ended up in non-graduate jobs - a figure exceeded only by Greece and Estonia.  Around one in twelve of those working in low skilled occupations - such as in coffee shops, bars, call centres and front of house at hospitality events - are now graduates, according to the figures.  The research also shows that the UK has the second highest graduation ration amongst Western nations belonging to the OECD - behind Iceland. It shows it has a 54 per cent graduation rate. Germany, by contrast, has a rate of just 31 per cent.  It concludes the growth of graduates is “significantly outstripping the growth of high-skilled jobs generated by the labour market” in most OECD countries. However, it adds the trend is “particularly pronounced in the UK”.  “The assumption that we will transition to a more productive, higher value higher skilled economy by just increasing the conveyor belt of graduates is proven to be flawed,” said Peter Cheese, chief executive of the CIPD.  Instead, employers have started using degrees as a determinant when recruiting for what have traditionally been non-graduate jobs.

Read our privacy notice  “Many graduates are simply replacing non-graduates in less demanding jobs or entering jobs where the demand for graduate skills is non-existent or falling,” says the report.  “This trend has particularly affected occupations where apprenticeships have been historically important such as construction and manufacturing.”  The report’s findings emerge as UK universities are about to enrol a record number of graduates this autumn following the Government’s decision to lift the cap on the number of students universities can recruit.  Around one in 12 people working in low-skilled occupations in the UK are graduates Getty Getty Images  That, coupled with thousands of students aiming to beat the Government’s decision to axe maintenance grants from next September by forgoing gap years, means the number of recruits to universities is set to beat last year’s all-time high of half a million.  Figures published by UCAS, the university and colleges admissions service, showed 461, 120 had already been signed up for university courses this year - a three per cent rise on the same point last year. Of these, 34,000 had been accepted through the clearing system - a rise of six per cent on last year which was itself a record.  In addition, 5,020 of these were late applicants - meaning they could have decided to change their minds after Chancellor George Osborne’s budget decision to scrap maintenance grants.  The rise in student numbers will fuel concerns that growing numbers will be unable to repay their loans if growing numbers are recruited into lower paid jobs. At present, they only have to pay once they are earning £21,000 a year and the debt is written off after 30 years.  “This situation is unsustainable given that the Government estimates that 45 per cent of university graduates will not earn enough to repay their student loans,” said Mr Cheese. The figure is the estimate being worked on by the Government.  “Efforts need to be redoubled to ensure young people who are making choices after receiving their GCSE and A-level results can access good quality careers information, advice and guidance so they can make better informed decisions,” he added.  The report also coincides with further research published this morning showing a dire shortage of apprentices in the UK building industry with 66 per cent of small construction firms admitting they have been forced to turn down new business because they just do not have the employees to carry it out. Almost half have had to outsource work to other firms rather than leave it unfinished.  Watch more  The research by the Federation of Master Builders blames pressure being put on teenagers to stay in full-time education and influence from teachers and family friends to pursue more academic goals.  The CIPD report, which is published the day before more than half a million teenagers received their GCSE results, calls on ministers to raise their efforts to increase the quality and quantity of apprenticeships to plug the skill shortage gaps. It urges employers to review recruitment practices to avoid using degrees as a screening process for jobs who do not require a university education.  Thursday is expected to see little change in the pass rate of 98.5 per cent and the 68.8 per cent getting five or more top grade A* to C grade passes last year. Exams regulator Ofqual has already indicated there will be a further drift in the numbers taking core academic subjects such as maths, English, the sciences, history and geography. The numbers taking modern foreign languages is expected to remain about the same.  A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: “We are providing the right mix of university places and apprenticeships to ensure more people have the opportunity to advance their careers and businesses get the skills they need to grow.  “Demands for higher education remains strong and graduates enjoy a pay premium that reflects their value to employers.”  Case study  Will Swarbrick, 21, enjoyed a distinguished academic career at the University of Warwick graduating in the summer of this year with a First Class history degree.  Will Swarbrick secured a job in the technology sector after completing a history degree  In spite of this academic success he, like many of his counterparts, has entered into employment in an entirely unrelated sector.  Will secured a job just after graduation in the technology sector.  He now works for the games development company Exient, based in Leamington Spa, where he confesses that he rarely uses his degree.  “Unfortunately other than very general, transferable skills my degree hasn’t really come into play in my current job,” he said.  “Although I enjoyed studying history, in reality its practical use is almost non-existent in my current role.”  No longer concerned with Marx and Foucault, Will now spends his days thinking about console, handheld and mobile game development.  Does he feel the degree provided good value for money?  “Not yet, but maybe at some point in the longer term.”  He does not regret his choice to study history but is now more mindful of the non-academic aspects of university education like extra-curricular activities and employer networking.  He wishes that his university had provided more hands-on, practical employment support and says that such support was insufficient while he was an undergraduate.  “The university tried their best with emails and occasional talks, but real-world experience could have been better.”  He suggests that universities could have built employability sessions into the curriculum from the beginning of the degree course and could have made access to employer information more readily available.  He advises future graduates to put more emphasis on part-time work and work experience to build a successful CV.  “I had a job while studying for my degree and I’m sure this has helped me secure my current employment.”  Harvey Day","Majority of UK graduates are being forced into non-graduate work, says study",mixture,
ad18dc46,"Friends, The North Carolina Republican Party was pleased yesterday when, in conjunction with the Wake County GOP, we were able to force the resignation of State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement Chairman - Democrat Andy Penry, one of Gov. Roy Cooper's handpicked hyper-partisans - for gross violations concerning the code of conduct for Board members, and whose inexcusable lack of transparency dealing with rumors about unproven voting irregularities in the 9th Congressional District. Here are some news/video clips from the NCGOP & Wake County GOP Press Conference on Saturday: WTVD, WRAL, WSOC To view the full press conference, go to the link below: WRAL Here are our thoughts on the 9th Congressional District: Our longstanding position is that every lawful vote should be counted. We are glad to see that Democrats in North Carolina are FINALLY concerned about integrity at the ballot box. They certainly haven’t been in the past and have spent almost a decade arguing against any effort to shore up our election system. We obviously support an investigation into allegations of irregularities fraud as long as it is fair and includes the investigations of irregularities committed by both sides. T he reality is that there aren’t enough ballots in question to change the outcome of this election. Certifying the race has nothing to do with punishing any lawbreakers. Certifying the race has nothing to do with punishing any lawbreakers. To date, there has been no evidence made public that any illegal conduct actually occurred. The Democrats’ affidavits published in media reports do not give any indication as to which side the actions described may have benefited, and based on Democrats’ alleged past actions in Bladen County, these activities could easily be attributed to Democrat efforts. Further, nothing indicates any amount of votes that would affect the outcome of this election. Board of Elections needs to immediately certify this race while continuing their investigation. That is the ONLY appropriate step for the voters of the Ninth District as we prepare to convene a new Congress. The State Board needs to be stop acting in secret. They’ve provided no information to the media or the public. They refuse to discuss this race in public, doing all their work in closed session. What are they hiding? Are they hiding they have no evidence to justify delaying certification and simply want leverage in negotiations over new election rules, or do they simply want to try and steal a GOP Congressional Seat won fair and square? By statute, election protests must be filed within 2 business days following the County canvass. There were no protests filed within that time frame. We are pleased by Friday’s court ruling in our favor, extending the current SBOE until Dec 12. It’s unfortunate that this step had to be taken by our candidate but the ruling shows that the Board will have to perform its duties and certify our election in an expedient manner. That’s exactly what the voters of this district deserve. Governor Cooper sued to have total control over the elections process; he won. He helped defeat the Bipartisan Board of Elections Amendment. He wanted total control of elections and currently has it. He is responsible for this horrific process and the lack of transparency. If this election is stolen, Roy Cooper will have stolen it. Should a special election in NC09 occur, we predict well over 200,000 people who cast legal ballots would be disenfranchised and their legal votes erased. Only a fraction of the nearly 290,000 people who voted in NC09 would be able to vote again. Any new election or long delay in certification would result in 750,000 citizens in NC09 not being represented in Congress for an extended period of time. This is unacceptable. As to the number of non-returned absentee mail ballots, a significant number of these people voted instead by casting a ballot in-person early absentee or Election Day. It’s not uncommon for that to happen, e.g. a person is able to make it to their polling place in lieu of casting an absentee ballot. This is also explained in part due to problems with local boards sending absentee ballots in a timely matter. This reduces the percentage of non-returned ballots in each county in some cases by 10%-20%. It is also very reasonable to assume that a number of these ballots simply went non-returned. This is not discounting any potential wrongdoing but the full story needs to be told. a significant number of these people voted instead by casting a ballot in-person early absentee or Election Day.

Climate change is often misunderstood as a package deal: If global warming is “real,” both sides of the debate seem to assume, the climate lobby’s policy agenda follows inexorably. It does not. Climate policy advocates need to do a much better job of quantitatively analyzing economic costs and the actual, rather than symbolic, benefits of their policies. Skeptics would also do well to focus more attention on economic and policy analysis. To arrive at a wise policy response, we first need to consider how much economic damage climate change will do. Current models struggle to come up with economic costs commensurate with apocalyptic political rhetoric. Typical costs are well below 10% of gross domestic product in the year 2100 and beyond. That’s a lot of money—but it’s a lot of years, too. Even 10% less GDP in 100 years corresponds to 0.1 percentage point less annual GDP growth. Climate change therefore does not justify policies that cost more than 0.1 percentage point of growth. If the goal is 10% more GDP in 100 years, pro-growth tax, regulatory and entitlement reforms would be far more effective. Yes, the costs are not evenly spread. Some places will do better and some will do worse. The American South might be a worse place to grow wheat; Southern Canada might be a better one.

The British Guardian newspaper noted that Danish authorities rejected nearly 186 orders of renewing the temporary residence in the country since last summer, noting that this step is justified according to reports referring that the security situation in several areas of the country had “improved significantly”.  Denmark’s immigration minister Mattias Tesfaye told French Press that ‘We have made it clear to the Syrian refugees that their residence permit is temporary. It can be withdrawn if there is no need to renew it.”  The file of Syrian Refugees constituted a platform to put pressure on the Syrian state by Western countries and the Turkish regime who put obstacles to hinder the return of refugees to their home regardless of security stability achieved in Syria after the Syrian Arab Army had liberated wide areas from terrorism.

According to very high level sources from my years working National Security Intelligence with the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force, the feds have PROOF of the payments to both Kemp and Raffensperger.  The Trump election legal team forced the President to WAIT before revealing this, until both Kemp and Raffensperger CERTIFIED the Election results.  According to those same sources, once Kemp and Raffensperger CERTIFIED the results, their crime was complete. Both men certified those election results this week. By law, Mr. Raffensperger was obliged to certify the election results before 5 p.m. on Friday. Gov. Kemp, had to then certify the results by 5 p.m. on Saturday. Both men did exactly those acts.  The implications of this revelation are staggering. First, that a sitting REPUBLICAN Governor would stab his Party's President, and our nation, in the back, for a foreign government, is utterly horrifying. People are already asking  My God, what could they have offered that he would sell out his own people? His own country?  That a foreign nation would DARE to pay money in order to rig or steal a U.S. Presidential Election is . . . a casus belli Cause for war. China appears to have tried to STEAL our freedom by STEALING our Elections. War is justified.

43b52abb,"A recent military study shows military personnel evaluated who received the flu vaccine were at 36 percent increased risk for coronavirus with varied benefit in preventing some strains of the flu.  “Examining noninfluenza viruses specifically, the odds of both coronavirus and human metapneumovirus in vaccinated individuals were significantly higher when compared to unvaccinated individuals OR = 1.36 and 1.51, respectively Table 5.”  The flu vaccine studied demonstrated varied benefit in flu prevention – – some strains showed significant benefit while others did not.  Titled, Influenza vaccination and respiratory virus interference among Department of Defense personnel during the 2017–2018 influenza season, the report on the study addresses the phenomena of vaccine virus interference of the influenza vaccine.  Flu Vaccine Interference  Paraphrasing, the study highlights the value of the human body’s ability to fight against viruses. Apparently, by contracting influenza, the body naturally “may reduce the risk of non-influenza respiratory viruses…”  Due to the flu vaccine’s “interference” with the naturally occurring biological process, there may be an increased risk of contracting non-influenza viruses:  “While influenza vaccination offers protection against influenza, natural influenza infection may reduce the risk of non-influenza respiratory viruses by providing temporary, non-specific immunity against these viruses. On the other hand, recently published studies have described the phenomenon of vaccine-associated virus interference; that is, vaccinated individuals may be at increased risk for other respiratory viruses because they do not receive the non-specific immunity associated with natural infection.”  Why This Topic?  I started digging into this topic on the Department of Veterans Affairs’ VA advice two weeks ago when I noticed the agency’s top advice about coronavirus was to “get a flu shot”.  This advice seemed a bit too simplistic when given to a population of largely elderly veterans with significant disabilities, vaccine histories, and exposures to various pathogens worldwide.  After writing about it, one reader sent an email citing this study in PubMed.  I was later provided a copy of the full study and reviewed it with an expert to verify my own conclusions based on the information in that report.  Informed Consent For Flu Vaccine  Now, the feedback I received that really caught my attention was mainly in a question: Is the heightened risk of coronavirus and other pathogens worth the benefit of the influenza vaccine based on this study as broken down in Table 5 above?  The column to focus on is “OR” in Table 5.  Coronavirus is 1.36 meaning 36% higher risk.  The influenza virus overall is 0.57 meaning the risk of contracting the flu was reduced overall. Three variants of flu did not receive a statistically significant reduction in risk.  Three of 8 evaluations noted a statistically insignificant benefit for the flu shot. Meanwhile, shot takers were at increased risk for coronavirus of 36%. I would bet $1 that this year, many Americans would likely rethink taking the vaccine with that bit of information.  If VA has this information, and they likely do, should the agency be required to share this increased risk factor with individuals considering the shot?  Studied Military Population  The study, published in the scientific journal Vaccine January 2020, was conducted by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch Air Force Satellite at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH.  Taken at face value, the study indicates people who receive the flu vaccine are at increased risk for coronavirus pre-COVID-19. Like veterans, current service members, school teachers, and medical professionals, the study population consisted of a population with a history of being heavily vaccinated.  “The DoD provides a unique population for vaccination studies as mandatory vaccination against influenza is required by the DoD for all Active Duty and Reserve Component personnel. This study aims to examine the relationship between specific respiratory viruses and influenza vaccination. The protocol for this study was reviewed and approved as exempt by the Air Force Research Laboratory Institutional Review Board.”  Future § 1151 Claims For Malpractice?  Will veterans who contract the coronavirus after receipt of the flu vaccine based on VA’s top recommendation be eligible for § 1151 claims for malpractice?  How will the US Court of Claims – Vaccine Court handle an influx of US citizens injured by contracting the coronavirus due to the significant risk in the study?  Given that this report was published by DOD researchers in a scientific journal, why is VA telling veterans to get the influenza vaccine?  What is the motive behind their advice?  Veterans, and many disabled veterans, may be at higher risk of contracting coronavirus based on vaccine history alone. That is especially true for veterans who took the flu vaccine at the encouragement of VA doctors.  Who stands to gain with the current recommendation?  There are winners and losers with each of these decisions. The virus itself appears to more severely impact the elderly, of which the veteran population has many.  How about Vietnam veterans exposed to toxic herbicides?  This virus is basically a death sentence for our poorly treated disabled Vietnam veterans who rely on VA to provide safe and effective medical care for their diabetes, cancer, hypertension, etc.  Ask Your Doctor  I encourage all readers to do your own research. Ask your VA medical doctor about this study and whether they agree with the blanket recommendation of the agency to get a flu shot to get ahead of coronavirus.  Is this solid medical advice?  For those interested, the study’s data came from the Department of Defense Global Respiratory Pathogen Surveillance Program DoDGRS is a DoD-wide program established by the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System GEIS.  The individuals included in the study provided respiratory specimens to the DoDGRS for 2017-2018 influenza season. Individuals who were sick prior to receipt of the flu vaccine were excluded from the study:  “All people submitting a respiratory specimen to the DoDGRS for the 2017–2018 influenza season were eligible for the study. The influenza season began 1 October 2017 and ended 29 September 2018. Those who submitted a sample and only tested positive for Chlamydia pneumoniae and/or Mycoplasma pneumoniae were excluded because these illnesses are bacteriological in nature, not viral. People with influenza and non-influenza coinfections were excluded because they could not be uniquely classified as either influenza or non-influenza respiratory virus. Individuals with multiple specimens collected during the season were also removed from the study as they could have had multiple different viruses over the season. Specimens where neither vaccination status could be obtained via databases nor a questionnaire was completed were excluded because vaccination status could not be confirmed. Subjects who were ill before receiving vaccination were excluded as vaccination status would therefore be unrelated to illness. Lastly, those people for whom the laboratory rejected the specimen were not included in the final study population.”  Be Optimistic But Careful  From what I can tell, the odds of being exposed in the US are high. The death rate if you get sick is high enough to warrant concern.  Wouldn’t it be nice to get good advice from the socialized healthcare system managed by the VA that is supposed to provide us with care?  For some non-US centric news about the virus, I wanted to include a YouTube video of 60 Minutes Australia about their perspective on the disease.  Now, this video pushes the narrative that the disease originated from the wet markets in Wuhan that also happened to be located near the level 4 biological laboratory studying the virus. I do not believe we know enough to confirm whether the origin is from such markets or manmade.  Getting Your Flu Shot?  I am personally not getting the flu shot and do not plan on taking any vaccines moving forward beyond what I was forced to take in the military due to vaccine injury.  What are your thoughts?

3e8383dd,"The immune system is something that is highly misunderstood not just by everyday people but also by the many conventional doctors who we depend on for health advice.  Most people resort to things like synthetic vitamins and medicines ignoring better natural alternatives to deal with colds and improve immunity, but the cycle of sickness always seems to continue.  For people with compromised immune systems, there are many natural options, and now researchers have discovered what could well be one of the best ways to reset and recharge your immune system; one that happens to be free and is believed to work even in the elderly as well.  White blood cells right help immune response, and they can be recycled through fasting, the study showed.  Three Days to a Whole New Immune System  According to researchers at the University of Southern California, the act of fasting for as little as three days can regenerate the entire immune system, even in elderly people.  The researchers said that fasting helps the body’s stem cells to begin producing new white blood cells, which help to fight off infection.  They added that the discovery could be especially effective for people suffering from damaged immune systems, including chemotherapy patients, who were protected from the toxic impacts of the treatment during the fasting period.  Flipping a “Regenerative Switch”  The researchers said that fasting helps the body’s stem cells to begin producing new white blood cells which help to fight off infection in the body.  “Fasting gives the ‘OK’ for stem cells to go ahead and begin proliferating and rebuild the entire system,” Prof. Valter Longo, Professor of Gerontology and the Biological Sciences at the University of Southern California, told the UK’s The Telegraph.  He added that the body actually removed parts that were damaged, old or inefficient during the fasting process, creating “literally, a new immune system.”  According to Dr. Longo a person’s system recycles unneeded immune cells, especially damaged ones, in order to create energy while they are fasting.  Over the course of his study’s trials, participants were asked to regularly fast between 2-4 days over a 6 month period.  The study was released in June and Dr. Longo said that clinical trials must still be completed, but added that the research looks “very promising.”  sources: telegraph, althealthworks, cell, medicalnewstoday, nationalpost, usc",“Very Promising:” USC Researchers Discover How to Regenerate Your Entire Immune System in 72 Hours,other,

Holding virtual rallies, releasing a slew of negative ads across the airwaves nationwide, and selling facemasks emblazoned with images of the candidate’s face are just a few of the money-making schemes running for its benefit. But now, Joe Barron, head of the FBI’s Department of Detectivity says they’ve gone too far by accepting a check for thirty-one dollars from the organization called “Antifa.”  The donation, which arrived yesterday at campaign headquarters in Floppyballs, California, was confirmed to have been vetted by interns, and deposited into campaign coffers by Democrat volunteer Calypso Soros, a second cousin of the well-known billionaire. Barron detailed the possible actionable offense:  “Anything from Antifa is blood money, because they have been officially labelled an Anti-American organization by both Trumptards International and Diamond and Silk’s ‘Tents Can Be Clothes’ retail outlet stores. Accepting that money is the same as if you picked up a dollar on the street that a serial killer had dropped two days before. Sure, it seems innocent : but you’re still infected with evil. Biden might as well wear satanic cthulu robes and decapitate a chicken on top of Mother Theresa’s grave for what that thirty one dollars has done to his soul.”  So far, representitives of the Vice President’s campaign haven’t commented on what is sure to become a very serious scandal, but just like his rival Donald Trump, it will bloat and fester until one day it will no doubt explode in some Popeye’s chicken restroom.",Biden Accepts Campaign Donation From Antifa,other,

9401748d,"This is one in a series of articles taken from eyewitness testimony before the International Common Law Court of Justice in Brussels. Five international judges are examining evidence of child rape, torture, murder and kidnapping allegedly done by global elite members of the Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult network. Regular Ninth Circle child sacrifices were said to take place in the catacombs of Catholic Cathedrals, the Vatican, on private estates and groves and government military bases in Belgium, Holland, Spain, Australia, Ireland, France, England and the US. At least 34 child mass grave sites were identified in Ireland, Spain and Canada – and refused excavation by the respective governments, Crown of England and Catholic Church. Named as present in Ninth Circle activities were Pope Francis, former Pope Ratzinger;Anglican, United Church of Canada and Catholic Church officials including Cardinals; members of European royalty including Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip; officials of the Canadian, Australian, UK and US military and governments including the USA’s CIA, plus prominent government ministers, judges, politicians and businessmen from the US, Belgium, Holland, Canada, Australia, France, Ireland and the UK.  Teens were drugged, stripped naked, raped, hunted down in the woods and killed by European royals according to this week’s latest eyewitness to testify before the International Common Law Court of Justice in Brussels. The woman was the fourth eyewitness to give accounts about these human hunting parties of the global elite Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult network. A former member of the Netherlands criminal drug syndicate known as Octopus testified that victims were obtained for these human hunting parties from juvenile detention centers in Belgium and Holland.  “In 2004 I was an involuntary witness to torture, rape and murder sessions of drugged children performed for a group of high ranked people of the Netherlands” stated a woman. “I was taken to a hunting party in Belgium close to Brussels where I saw two boys and a girl ages 14 to 16, hunted and killed by global elites. The human hunting party was heavily guarded by the Netherlands Royal Guards. I was told that King Albert of Belgium was present.”  Four eyewitnesses confirmed that as children and youths they were forced to attend human hunting parties where they and other children were raped, with some killed, and deceased boy’s penises were cut off. Allegedly there was a Dutch countryside palace where boys’ penises were displayed like trophies on a wall. Some hunting parties were hosted on the grounds of Belgium Queen Beatrix’s Palace.  Dutch therapist Toos Nijenhuis claimed that as a four year-old she was forced to witness murders of children that involved former Pope Ratzinger, a Dutch Catholic Cardinal, plus the father of Netherlands Belgium Queen Beatrix and Bilderberger Founder, Dutch Crown Prince Alfrink Bernhard. “I saw the former Pope Joseph Ratzinger murder a little girl? another witness confirmed. “It was at a French chateau in the fall of 1987. It was ugly, horrible and didn’t happen just once. Ratzinger and Bernhard were some of the more prominent men who took part.”  In Ireland, Spain and Canada 34 child mass grave sites were discovered and appeared linked to Ninth Circle activities. The largest was the Mohawk Indian Residential School in Brantford Ontario where child remains were identified in 2008 before the Catholic Church, Canadian government and English Crown shut down the dig by professional archeologists. The 2013 ICLCJ Court had found Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip guilty for the Oct. 10 1964 disappearance of ten native children from the Catholic residential school in Kamloops British Columbia. In the first two weeks of the 2014 court witnesses identified Dutch and Belgian royal participants in the rape and killing of Mohawk children and newborns. Named were Bernhard and King Hendrick, consort to Queen Wilhelmina of Holland.  Alleged to be present during the human hunting parties were the late Prince Johan Friso and his wife Mabel Wisse Smit, former ministers, the top man of the Dutch army, the under secretary of the Raad Van State in the Netherlands, the Vice-Roy next to Queen Beatrix and other global business and political leaders including some from the US. “Surely the present King Willem Alexander and King Filip and their wives know about this abuse and murder of children” said one eyewitness.”They do nothing about it and likely are the ones to stop investigations and prosecutions.”  In January 2014 the brother of the king of Holland Prince Johan Friso passed away in a coma after these three Dutch-language websites shown here reached the internet. The websites revealed that Friso was at the human hunting and killing parties.”The story came on the internet after years of trying to move the policy and justice department in the Netherlands to act against the criminals,” an eyewitness said. “Nobody did anything to stop these criminals, probably because Queen Beatrix and King Albert likely interfered with the investigations.”  Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.  Human hunting parties were said to take place on the grounds of Belgium Queen Beatrix’s Palace in the Netherlands. Two witnesses have named former Pope Joseph Ratzinger and Queen Beatrix’s father the deceased Prince Alfrink Bernhard, as being present at child sacrifices. Both were said to be Nazi sympathizers.  The ICLCJ Court received a collection of Jesuit archival records about a child sacrificial cult known as the Knights of Darkness. In 1933 the Knights were established by the Catholic Jesuits and Nazi Waffen S.S. Division. The records showed Ratzinger was identified as a member of the Knights while working as an S.S. Chaplain’s assistant at the Ravensbruck Concentration Camp in Germany. The records also stated that Ratzinger participated in child sacrificial rites using kidnapped children from the camps or political prisoners.  Another court document called the Magisterial Privilege indicated child sacrifice was a regular occurrence at the Vatican. At the tender age of 12 “Svali” of San Diego County California claimed she was brought to catacombs beneath the Vatican to witness the sacrifice of a three year-old drugged boy. In this video her interviewer said that 24 years prior a “Maria” told him she witnessed another satanic child sacrifice rite in the same Vatican Catacombs.  Last week an Irish police investigator reported to the ICLCJ Court that the close to 800 babies buried in a Catholic Nun’s septic tank were dismembered, decapitated and in bits and pieces – signs that they could have been murdered in Satanic child sacrifice rites. In the last two months the ICLCJ Court has heard these heart-wrenching testimonies about the rape, torture and murder of children as recently as 2010 by Catholic leaders, European royal family members and other global elites. Murder sites of the Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult were said to be in the catacombs of Catholic Cathedrals including the Vatican and on private estates, military establishments and groves in Belgium, Holland, Spain, Australia, France, England and the US.  The ICLCJ Court has been overwhelmed with newly discovered evidence and a number of new witnesses coming forward to testify about Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult activities. They have uncovered Ninth Circle Satanic Cult member possible involvement in international child sacrifice, kidnapping, exploitation and drug rings. The five international judges and 27 jury members were expected to remain in session for at least a year due to the complexity of the cases.  Amnesty has been offered to citizens or employees of the Vatican, Crown of England, churches or governments willing to give sworn testimony or evidence that leads to the prosecution of these global elites suspected of committing crimes. Rewards up to 10,000 euros or around 13,660 dollars was available through the ICLCJ court.  The ICLCJ Court had over 450 Common Law Peace Officers in 13 countries, with 51 local chartered groups operating. Local organizing funds were available for common law groups that applied through the International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State.

Physicians have demonstrated the powerful antiviral action of vitamin C for decades. There has been a lack of media coverage of this effective and successful approach against viruses in general, and coronavirus in particular.  It is very important to maximize the body’s anti-oxidative capacity and natural immunity to prevent and minimize symptoms when a virus attacks the human body. The host environment is crucial. Preventing is obviously easier than treating severe illness.  But treat serious illness seriously. Do not hesitate to seek medical attention. It is not an either-or choice. Vitamin C can be used right along with medicines when they are indicated.  “I have not seen any flu yet that was not cured or markedly ameliorated by massive doses of vitamin C.” Robert F. Cathcart, MD  The physicians of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service and the International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine urge a nutrient-based method to prevent or minimize symptoms for future viral infection. The following inexpensive supplemental levels are recommended for adults; for children reduce these in proportion to body weight:  Vitamin C: 3,000 milligrams or more daily, in divided doses.  Vitamin D3: 2,000 International Units daily. Start with 5,000 IU/day for two weeks, then reduce to 2,000  Magnesium: 400 mg daily in citrate, malate, chelate, or chloride form  Zinc: 20 mg daily  Selenium: 100 mcg micrograms daily  Vitamin C [1] , Vitamin D [2] , magnesium [3] , zinc [4] , and selenium [5] have been shown to strengthen the immune system against viruses.  The basis for using high doses of vitamin C to prevent and combat virus-caused illness may be traced back to vitamin C’s early success against polio, first reported in the late 1940s. [6] Many people are unaware, even surprised, to learn this. Further clinical evidence built up over the decades, leading to an anti-virus protocol published in 1980. [7]  It is important to remember that preventing and treating respiratory infections with large amounts of vitamin C is well established. Those who believe that vitamin C generally has merit, but massive doses are ineffective or somehow harmful, will do well to read the original papers for themselves. To dismiss the work of these doctors simply because they had success so long ago sidesteps a more important question: Why has the benefit of their clinical experience not been presented to the public by responsible governmental authorities, especially in the face of a viral pandemic?

Experts suggested bats could host the virus, which has killed 17 people, in a paper published in the China Science Bulletin – admitting the pneumonia-like virus was underestimated by the research community.

eabcaf9a,"Net migration could fall by about 100,000 a year if the UK leaves the EU and introduces work permits for EU citizens, a pressure group has said.  Migration Watch says this would cut net migration - the difference between the number of people arriving and leaving - from 180,000 to 65,000 a year.  But James McGrory, from the pro-EU Britain Stronger In Europe campaign, called the report disingenuous.  He said it was another example of fudging the facts.      Follow the latest updates with BBC Politics Live  The UK is set to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether or not it should remain a member of the European Union.  The report from Migration Watch, which advocates tighter immigration controls, looks at possible policies that could be introduced if the UK voted to leave the EU and considers their impact on overall migration figures. lineimage copyrightNot Specified Analysis The Union Jack flag next to the European Flagimage copyrightReuters image captionThe Conservatives have promised to hold an in/out referendum on the EU by the end of 2017  BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw  No-one knows for sure what impact a British exit from the EU would have on immigration.  It would depend on the terms of a new settlement that might take months to negotiate and years to put into place.  But say, as Migration Watch advocates, that it did herald controls on the flow of low-skilled EU migrant labour, would that really work in reducing net migration?  Wouldn't there be an influx of migrants from the EU before the restrictions came into force?  Wouldn't businesses that currently rely on labourers, chambermaids and supermarket shelf-stackers from Europe demand that they be allowed to recruit them from elsewhere?  And wouldn't the EU introduce work permits for British workers, thereby reducing emigration from the UK?  These are questions that need answers in the months leading up to the referendum. lineimage copyrightNot Specified 'Pressure on services'  The report suggested the key change could be the introduction of work permits which would limit EU nationals entering the country to higher-skilled workers, their family members and students, while low-skilled workers would not be granted entry.  Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch, said: It is time to examine possible alternative immigration regimes.  Under the current arrangements, signs indicated migration to Britain would continue at a substantial rate for the foreseeable future, he said.  Indeed, immigrants tend to generate further migration as their friends and relatives join them in their new countries, he said.  Work permits for EU citizens would substantially reduce net migration and its resultant pressure on our population and public services.  The 16-page paper suggests that on average only about 20% of EU migrants who came to Britain between 2004 and 2014 were doing higher-skilled work.  It said: This could substantially reduce the EU inflow for work to perhaps one fifth of its recent level and would, in turn, substantially reduce net migration by perhaps 100,000 a year from the current level of 180,000. Graph showing long-term international migration to the UK  The figures should not be taken as a precise estimate but were intended to illustrate the scale of the potential reduction under the policy outlined, it said.  There would be no need for restrictions on EU citizens coming to the UK as students or tourists, the authors concluded.  Those who are self-sufficient would also be free to live in Britain, including those who are looking for jobs. 'No evidence'  Under the suggested system there would also be no restriction on EU family members of British citizens coming to join them, while relatives of European skilled workers and students would have the right to live and work in the UK.  Those EU citizens already living and working in the UK would retain their existing rights, Migration Watch suggested.  However, pro-EU campaigner Mr McGrory said: Right now, Britain has the best of both worlds. We have an opt-out from the passport-free Schengen area, while still enjoying full access to the single market.  The Leave campaigns haven't produced a shred of evidence to show how they could guarantee a deal that is at least as good if we left.  The Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said if it became harder for employers to recruit EU workers they may try to bring in more migrants from outside Europe.  Most recent estimated net migration to the UK reached a record 336,000 in the year to June 2015 according to Office for National Statistics ONS figures  ","Leaving EU 'would cut migration by 100,000' - Migration Watch",other,
2a9c9dfe,"May 28, 2020  New Research Study Clarifies Health Outcomes in Vaccinated versus Unvaccinated Children  Print  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE – May 28, 2020  Contact:  Unvaccinated children are less likely to be diagnosed with developmental delays, asthma, and ear infections.  Redding CA— A new peer-reviewed study in the journal SAGE Open Medicine details the health outcomes of vaccinated versus unvaccinated children from three pediatric practices in the United States concludes that unvaccinated children have better health outcomes than their vaccinated peers.  Children in the study were followed continuously for a minimum of 3 years from birth. The study was based on medical records of over 2000 children enrolled in three pediatric practices and born between November 2005 and June 2015. Vaccination status was determined based on any vaccination received prior to one year of age which yielded 30.9% of the children in the unvaccinated group. Results show that vaccination before one year of age led to significantly increased odds of medical diagnoses of developmental delays, asthma and ear infections in children.  In a separate analysis, based on the number of vaccines received by one year of age, children receiving more vaccines were more likely to be diagnosed with gastrointestinal disorders compared to those who received no vaccines within the same timeframe. In temporal analyses, children vaccinated prior to six months of age showed significant risks of each of the disorders studied as compared to unvaccinated children in the same timeframe.  The study, coauthored by Dr. Brian Hooker and Mr. Neil Miller, is unique in that all diagnoses were verified using abstracted medical records from each of the participating pediatric practices. Lead author of the study, Dr. Hooker, stated, “The results definitely indicate better health outcomes in children who did not receive vaccines within their first year of life. These findings are consistent with additional research that has identified vaccination as a risk factor for a variety of adverse health outcomes . Such findings merit additional large-scale study of vaccinated and unvaccinated children in order to provide optimal health as well as protection against infectious diseases.”  ###",New Research Study Clarifies Health Outcomes in Vaccinated versus Unvaccinated Children,other,
29b21551,"Dave Janda of Operation Freedom www.DaveJanda.com has unleashed a bombshell story with huge implications for Tuesday’s elections. Janda’s guest in his latest broadcast is a former high-level intelligence official Lt. Gen. Tom McInerney who warns that the Dems and the CIA have put in place a mechanism which can alter the voting results of electronic voting machines in key swing states like Pennsylvania that will determine the outcome of the election.  This covert technology is called Operation Scorecard, and it was built by the CIA to surreptitiously steal elections in targeted countries. Now, that technology is being turned against the United States of America and is about to be activated on Tuesday to steal the election for Biden, explains Janda’s guest.  OmegaManRadio, a pro-liberty, pro-Christian podcast channel, has reposted portions of the Dave Janda interview at this link on Soundcloud.com. Start listening around the 20 minute mark to hear the bombshell segments.  The original interview from Dave Janda is currently available via YouTube but is likely to be blacklisted soon. Here’s the YouTube embed:  As McInerney explains in the video, after the closing of polls in Pennsylvania and other swing states, the voting machines will be intercepted and then altered using complex algorithms to alter the votes in a way that evades detection, handing a victory to the pre-designated “winner” Joe Biden.  Smells like FREEDOM. Order Founders Blend Organic Coffee from Freedom First Coffee. Use NOQ as the promo code for 10% off!  In the interview, he explains that a covert app called “Scorecard” steals votes by making sure Democrats always stay about 3% ahead of their Republican rivals. “Scorecard steals the elections by tampering with the computers at the transfer points,” he adds.  This also explains why Joe Biden recently said, with great clarity, “We have put together I think the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics.”  Here’s the video of Biden bragging about the massive voter fraud system that’s being used to try to to steal the election for him:  This might also help explain why Joe Biden told voters at a recent small rally that he didn’t “need their vote” to become President, and why Nancy Pelosi says Biden will win no matter what the votes say on Nov. 3rd.  The deep state has a plan in place to steal this election by altering votes in key swing states. And if Trump challenges the fraud, he will be condemned for “refusing to accept the outcome” of the rigged election. This is the narrative trap that has been set by the treasonous mainstream media.  Keep in mind that just over the last two days, Trump campaign officials were asking for detailed information about how voting machines are handled in Pennsylvania. According to the anti-Trump Washington Post a deep state propaganda mouthpiece:  …the Trump campaign asked officials in Cumberland County for the names of people who transport ballots and voting machines once polls close, the names of people who have access to the ballots afterward, and the precise locations where the ballots are stored, including room numbers.  It seems that Trump’s people are already aware that Dems are working to fraudulently steal this election by altering votes in Pennsylvania, and they’re trying to stop it.  Be aware that unless Trump receives an overwhelming wave of votes on Tuesday — beyond the margin of Democrat fraud — the Dems have a mechanism in place to steal the election, condemn Trump for challenging the vote theft, and seizing control of the White House from this day forward.  Spread this story far and wide. Everything is now at stake.  RED ALERT: Dems collude with CIA to launch intelligence operation that ALTERS voting machine results in Pennsylvania and other swing states  Update:  COVID-19 may take down an independent news outlet  Nobody said running a media site would be easy. We could use some help keeping this site afloat.  Colleagues have called me the worst fundraiser ever. My skills are squarely rooted on the journalistic side of running a news outlet. Paying the bills has never been my forte, but we’ve survived. We have ads on the site that help, but since the site’s inception this has been a labor of love that otherwise doesn’t bring in the level of revenue necessary to justify it.  When I left a nice, corporate career in 2017, I did so knowing I wouldn’t make nearly as much money. But what we do at NOQ Report to deliver the truth and fight the progressive mainstream media narrative that has plagued this nation is too important for me to sacrifice it for the sake of wealth. We know we’ll never make a ton of money this way, and we’re okay with that.  Things have become harder with the coronavirus lockdowns. Both ad money and donations that have kept us afloat for a while have dropped dramatically. We thought we could weather the storm, but the so-called “surge” or “2nd-wave” that mainstream media and Democrats are pushing has put our prospects in jeopardy. In short, we are now in desperate need of financial assistance.  The best way NOQ Report readers can help is to donate. Our Giving Fuel page makes it easy to donate one-time or monthly. Alternatively, you can donate through PayPal as well. We need approximately $11,500 to stay afloat for the rest of 2020, but more would be wonderful and any amount that brings us closer to our goal is greatly appreciated.  The second way to help is to become a partner. We’ve strongly considered seeking angel investors in the past but because we were paying the bills, it didn’t seem necessary. Now, we’re struggling to pay the bills. This shouldn’t be the case as our traffic the last year has been going up dramatically. June, 2018, we had 11,678 visitors. A year later in June, 2019, we were up to 116,194. In June, 2020, we had 614,192.

Interested investors should contact me directly with the contact button above.  Election year or not, coronavirus lockdowns or not, anarchic riots or not, the need for truthful journalism endures. But in these times, we need as many conservative media voices as possible. Please help keep NOQ Report going.  Join fellow patriots as we form a grassroots movement to advance the cause of conservatism. The coronavirus crisis has prompted many, even some conservatives, to promote authoritarianism.

fba6d4c5,"To say out-loud that you find the results of the 2020 presidential election odd is to invite derision. You must be a crank or a conspiracy theorist. Mark me down as a crank, then. I am a pollster and I find this election to be deeply puzzling. I also think that the Trump campaign is still well within its rights to contest the tabulations. Something very strange happened in America’s democracy in the early hours of Wednesday November 4 and the days that followed. It’s reasonable for a lot of Americans to want to find out exactly what.  First, consider some facts. President Trump received more votes than any previous incumbent seeking reelection. He got 11 million more votes than in 2016, the third largest rise in support ever for an incumbent. By way of comparison, President Obama was comfortably reelected in 2012 with 3.5 million fewer votes than he received in 2008.  Trump’s vote increased so much because, according to exit polls, he performed far better with many key demographic groups. Ninety-five percent of Republicans voted for him. He did extraordinarily well with rural male working-class whites.  Trump grew his support among black voters by 50 percent over 2016. Nationally, Joe Biden’s black support fell well below 90 percent, the level below which Democratic presidential candidates usually lose.  Trump increased his share of the national Hispanic vote to 35 percent. With 60 percent or less of the national Hispanic vote, it is arithmetically impossible for a Democratic presidential candidate to win Florida, Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico. Bellwether states swung further in Trump’s direction than in 2016. Florida, Ohio and Iowa each defied America’s media polls with huge wins for Trump. Since 1852, only Richard Nixon has lost the Electoral College after winning this trio, and that 1960 defeat to John F. Kennedy is still the subject of great suspicion.  Midwestern states Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin always swing in the same direction as Ohio and Iowa, their regional peers. Ohio likewise swings with Florida. Current tallies show that, outside of a few cities, the Rust Belt swung in Trump’s direction. Yet, Biden leads in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin because of an apparent avalanche of black votes in Detroit, Philadelphia, and Milwaukee. Biden’s ‘winning’ margin was derived almost entirely from such voters in these cities, as coincidentally his black vote spiked only in exactly the locations necessary to secure victory. He did not receive comparable levels of support among comparable demographic groups in comparable states, which is highly unusual for the presidential victor.  We are told that Biden won more votes nationally than any presidential candidate in history. But he won a record low of 17 percent of counties; he only won 524 counties, as opposed to the 873 counties Obama won in 2008. Yet, Biden somehow outdid Obama in total votes.  Victorious presidential candidates, especially challengers, usually have down-ballot coattails; Biden did not. The Republicans held the Senate and enjoyed a ‘red wave’ in the House, where they gained a large number of seats while winning all 27 toss-up contests. Trump’s party did not lose a single state legislature and actually made gains at the state level.  Another anomaly is found in the comparison between the polls and non-polling metrics. The latter include: party registrations trends; the candidates’ respective primary votes; candidate enthusiasm; social media followings; broadcast and digital media ratings; online searches; the number of especially small donors; and the number of individuals betting on each candidate.  Despite poor recent performances, media and academic polls have an impressive 80 percent record predicting the winner during the modern era. But, when the polls err, non-polling metrics do not; the latter have a 100 percent record. Every non-polling metric forecast Trump’s reelection. For Trump to lose this election, the mainstream polls needed to be correct, which they were not. Furthermore, for Trump to lose, not only did one or more of these metrics have to be wrong for the first time ever, but every single one had to be wrong, and at the very same time; not an impossible outcome, but extremely unlikely nonetheless.  Atypical voting patterns married with misses by polling and non-polling metrics should give observers pause for thought. Adding to the mystery is a cascade of information about the bizarre manner in which so many ballots were accumulated and counted.  The following peculiarities also lack compelling explanations:  1. Late on election night, with Trump comfortably ahead, many swing states stopped counting ballots. In most cases, observers were removed from the counting facilities. Counting generally continued without the observers  2. Statistically abnormal vote counts were the new normal when counting resumed. They were unusually large in size hundreds of thousands and had an unusually high 90 percent and above Biden-to-Trump ratio  3. Late arriving ballots were counted. In Pennsylvania, 23,000 absentee ballots have impossible postal return dates and another 86,000 have such extraordinary return dates they raise serious questions  4. The failure to match signatures on mail-in ballots. The destruction of mail-in ballot envelopes, which must contain signatures  5. Historically low absentee ballot rejection rates despite the massive expansion of mail voting. Such is Biden’s narrow margin that, as political analyst Robert Barnes observes, ‘If the states simply imposed the same absentee ballot rejection rate as recent cycles, then Trump wins the election’  6. Missing votes. In Delaware County, Pennsylvania, 50,000 votes held on 47 USB cards are missing  7. Non-resident voters. Matt Braynard’s Voter Integrity Project estimates that 20,312 people who no longer met residency requirements cast ballots in Georgia. Biden’s margin is 12,670 votes",Reasons why the 2020 presidential election is deeply puzzling,other,
6612a10d,"Deliveroo couriers have demanded union recognition and employment rights and are set to take legal action if the company rejects their request.  The news comes after a landmark ruling in October stated Uber drivers are employees, not self-employed as the company had claimed. The judgment could entitle thousands of “gig economy” workers to holiday pay and a guaranteed minimum wage.  The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain IWGB has demanded recognition from Deliveroo so that the union can bargain for pay and conditions on workers’ behalf. The deal will initially cover Camden in north London and will be rolled out nationwide if successful.  Recommended Read more Uber ordered to pay drivers minimum wage in landmark case  If half of drivers in the area sign up, Deliveroo will be forced to recognise the union. It will be the first collective bargaining agreement in the “gig economy”, setting a precedent for others to demand further rights.  Deliveroo has 10 business days to respond, after which an application will be submitted to the Central Arbitration Committee CAC asking it to force Deliveroo into collective bargaining.  IWGB general secretary Jason Moyer-Lee said: “Of course, for the CAC to entertain our request they will need to decide that Deliveroo drivers are ‘workers’ and not the ‘independent contractors’ you have bogusly deemed them to be,” Moyer-Lee said.  “Deliveroo drivers work for Deliveroo and as such they should be entitled to paid holiday, minimum wage, trade union rights, and all the other rights associated with worker status.”  Please enter your email address Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP Thanks for signing up to the News newsletter {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our privacy notice  Experts said the case could be hugely significant. Aaron Hayward, employment specialist at DJM Solicitors said it was “no surprise” the drivers were taking action after the Uber case.“The explosion of the gig economy means many thousands of workers across the UK are now engaged in temporary, casual work that doesn’t entitle them to paid holiday, minimum wage and other rights, because they are officially classified as ‘contractors’,” he said.  If the drivers are successful, Deliveroo will be the “first app-based employer to recognise a union in the UK. First they must succeed in convincing a tribunal that drivers should be reclassified as employees as opposed to contractors as collective bargaining laws only apply to employees.  “This is an employment case that employers, workers and lawyers alike will be watching with interest. As we move more towards a ‘gig economy’ based on short-term, software-driven casual work, this issue isn’t going to away anytime soon.”  Deliveroo delivers food from thousands of restaurants which do not have their own delivery service such as Pizza Express, Byron and Gourmet Burger Kitchen.  Drivers receive £3.75 per delivery under a new pilot scheme, but some have allege they wait up to an hour for a delivery, meaning their take-home pay is less than minimum wage. This is legal if the workers are self-employed, but many say it amounts to exploitation.

cda49fa7,"Vaccine manufacturer Merck has abandoned development of two coronavirus vaccines, saying that after extensive research it was concluded that the shots offered less protection than just contracting the virus itself and developing antibodies. The company announced that the shots V590 and V591 were ‘well tolerated’ by test patients, however they generated an ‘inferior’ immune system response in comparison with natural infection. The company stated that instead it will focus on research into therapeutic drugs labeled as MK-7110 and MK-4482. The drugs aim to protect patients from the damage of an overactive immune response to the virus. “Interim results from a Phase 3 study showed a greater than 50 percent reduction in the risk of death or respiratory failure in patients hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19,” the company’s statement noted of the MK-7110 drug. Merck is to receive around $356 million from the US government to fast-track production of the potential treatments under Operation Warp Speed. Chief Marketing Officer Michael Nally recently told Bloomberg that Merck is aiming to produce some 20 million courses of the MK-4482 drug, an oral antiviral which patients will take twice a day for five days. Meanwhile, in related news, German scientists have claimed that the UK Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is less than 8% effective in over 65s, prompting the vaccine developers to hit back, rubbishing the claims. The German media published the claims, alleging it had been ‘confirmed’ by ‘multiple’ unnamed senior German government sources. UK government ministers have suggested that the claim could be related to the ongoing dispute over delivery of the vaccine between the European Union and AstraZeneca. The EU, which is yet to approve the vaccine, has threatened to block exports of shots to Britain, in a move that has been branded ‘spiteful’ by British government sources. In an effort to make sure its member states get their ‘fair share’ of vaccines, the EU has also threatened to block the delivery of Pfizer vaccines to the UK, demanding that drug companies provide detailed information on when they plan to export Covid jabs to countries outside the bloc.",Merck Scraps COVID Vaccines; Says It’s More Effective To Get The Virus And Recover,other,

And, if they are not true, then Merck should sue me. But Merck won’t do that. And they won’t do that because in the United States, truth is an absolute defense against slander.”  This must-watch video details the many problems with the development and safety of Merck’s third-highest grossing product, Gardasil. Children’s Health Defense CHD and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., CHD’s Chairman and Chief Legal Counsel, ask that you watch and share this video so that you, and others, may make an informed decision of whether or not to give your child, boy or girl, a Gardasil vaccine. It can also be a useful tool for pediatricians who are trying to understand how this vaccine, that is actually causing health problems with young people, could have been approved by FDA and then recommended by CDC. The video is full of jaw-dropping facts about Gardasil and the clinical trials leading up to its release upon an unsuspecting public.  Transcript of “The Science” presentation:  Download “The Science” Transcript  Children’s Health Defense and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—Science Day Presentation for Gardasil  Hi, I’m Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and I’m making this video for the sake of parents who are trying to make an informed decision of whether or not to give their child, their boy or girl the Gardasil vaccine.  I’m also making this video as a tool for pediatricians who are trying to understand how this vaccine—if it’s actually causing all of these problems with young girls—could have been approved by FDA and then mandated by CDC.  Virtually all of the things that I’m going to talk about in this video are available to the public on public documents as I’m going to show.  Finally, I want to say this about Merck which is the company that makes the Gardasil vaccine.  Many of the things that I’m going to say today would be slanderous if they were not true. And if they’re not true then Merck should sue me. But Merck won’t do that and they won’t do it because in the United States truth is an absolute defense to slander. And second of all Merck knows that if they sue me, I’m going to immediately file a discovery request, and many, many, more documents are going to emerge that illustrate even more fraud by this company on the American public and the people all over the world.  Finally, as a footnote I’m not going to talk today about the specific biological mechanisms that allow this vaccine to cause harm in human beings. That information is out there it’s in dozens of peer-reviewed, published scientific documents. Many of these are described on our website and I urge people to go to the Children’s Health Defense website to educate themselves on those issues.  Today we’re going to talk about the clinical trial about Merck’s fraud in that process…and this is Merck’s claim:  The HPV vaccine will “eliminate cervical cancers and other HPV associated cancers.”  The danger of dying from HPV cancer in this country is 1 death in 43.5 thousand people.  Imagine you have a deck of cards but instead of 50 cards. There’s 43,500 on a on a big, big table and one of those cards is a black card. If you get that, you die.  So, Merck’s deal is that it’s going to remove that black card from the deck. But in order to play the game and make sure that Merck removes the black card, everybody who participates has to put in $420 because that’s the cost of the three-dose Gardasil vaccine.  So, here’s Gardasil by the numbers. So, the cost of the three-jab series average is about $420. There are 76 million children who essentially have been mandated by CDC to receive these vaccines. A blockbuster product from Merck, and global revenues from this vaccine today are about $2.3 billion dollars. It’s the third largest product in the company’s inventory.  The cost of saving one American life is 18.3 million dollars. People could argue whether or not that’s a reasonable value of a human life. What I would say was is that the criteria that we should use for evaluating reasonableness—is there a cheaper way to save more lives? And people would argue that Pap smears are the most effective way that 80 percent of cervical cancer deaths have already been eliminated by Pap smears. And this is the most effective technology.  Incidentally in another context HHS has already put a value on human life and the value is $250k. That is the maximum number that the vaccine compensation program will pay for killing an American citizen.  Prior to marketing the vaccine, the FDA licenses the vaccine, and in that licensing process Merck had to show that the vaccine was safe. According to Federal regulations the word “safety” means “relative freedom from harmful effects, taking into consideration the character of the product in relationship to the condition of the recipient at that time.”  So, what is the condition of the recipients of that target group for this vaccine. And this vaccine targets millions of preteens and teens, for whom the risk of dying from cervical cancer is practically zero. Cervical cancer’s median age of death is 58. It is first diagnosed at age 50 median.  A teenage girl or boy has zero chance of dying of this illness. Which means the threshold for giving this medication is very, very high.  Secondly it is mandated in some jurisdictions So the government is actually—government officials are actually—coming in and ordering people to take this medical intervention. So, we have to be sure that the threshold for risk, “the risk profile” for that medical intervention should be very, very low.  Third, unlike other medical interventions Gardasil recipients are perfectly healthy. So, when you give medication to a healthy individual you have to make sure that the risk profile is practically zero. And in order to determine risk, there is a standardized protocol. And it’s called double-blind placebo studies. What does that mean?  It means that the drug company that’s trying to license this product gives the medication to one group of people, maybe 5,000 or 10,000 people, and gives a placebo, an inert placebo, either an identical looking pill that is inert—it’s either saline or sugar—to a similarly situated group of 5,000 or 10,000 people and it’s double blind meaning that neither the patients nor the researchers knew who got the placebo and who got the actual medication.  And you can see here, here’s what the NIH says about the National Institute for Health placebos: an inactive substance that looks like a drug.  So here are typical examples:  Lipitor was given during its study phase to about 17k subjects. Half of them received Lipitor half of them received a sugar pill that looked identical to Lipitor and they were observed and studied for up to 3.3 years.  Why for so long? Because many of the injuries that are caused by medication are latent—they don’t show up for two or three or four or five years cancer for example may not show up for four or five years after the exposure. Autoimmune diseases and allergies and these kind of things take a long time to diagnose. Enbrel for that reason was delayed for 6.6 years and against a control group that received a saline injection.  Botox, there was a national emergency to get Botox to market so people could get their wrinkles cured, was studied for 51 weeks and it was studied against a saline injection.  Now I’m going to show you one of the really outrageous frauds that Merck committed during the clinical trials. This is an insert that is part of every vaccine package. And you can go on the Internet right now and look up that Merck product and search and find these two tables.  In the initial table you can see a there are three columns and this is a table that just looks at injuries at the vaccine site for redness and itching and bruising and pain at the vaccine site and they use one…there were 5,000 girls—5,088 girls who got the Gardasil vaccine.  Number two, there were 3,470 girls who got the AAHS control, what is that? That is the adjuvant in the vaccine. That is a toxic neurotoxin, that’s put in the vaccine to make it more long-lasting to provoke an immune response in the subject of the vaccine.  And most people believe that it is that aluminum adjuvant that is causing all of these injuries in the girls who are getting the vaccine. And there were 3,470 people who received just the neurotoxin with no antigens and no other vaccine components.  And you have a third group which is the placebo group. What I want you to look at is at these numbers. That in the Gardasil and AAHS control there is virtually the same number of injuries.  And when you get to the saline placebo, that injury rate is cut in half.  Now let’s go to the table where they talk about real systemic injuries…autoimmune diseases, and instead of showing us real science, which is to show us what happened to the saline group, they hide the saline group as a way of fooling you, your pediatrician and the regulatory agency by compressing it into the aluminum group and they never tell us. They say this is a combination of the aluminum adjuvant and the saline placebo. They don’t tell us how many in each category were compressed there. The real thing that you need to watch here is what happened.  These are all very, very serious injuries. These are injuries that in some cases people would feel were worse than death—and that affect people and debilitate for a lifetime in many cases.  And if you look at the bottom of the Gardasil group an astonishing 2.3 percent of the girls in the clinical study who received the Gardasil vaccine got ill from autoimmune diseases, many within seven months of taking the vaccine.  And look what happened in the aluminum group—the same number exactly. 2.3 percent.  Nobody, no parent would allow their daughter to take a substance that had a one-in-40 chance of giving them a lifetime disability.  World Health Organization says that using a spiked placebo, or a faux-cebo as Merck did with Gardasil, puts you at a methodological disadvantage that “it may be difficult or impossible to assess vaccine safety.”  Dr. Stanley Plotkin, who developed the polio vaccine…who developed the pertussis vaccine, who developed the rotavirus vaccine—the Stanley Plotkin award is the Nobel Prize of vaccinology it’s given to the top vaccinologist every year—and what he says is:  Unless you have a true control group you are in LA LA LAND.  Finally, the American Medical Association says the absence of double-blind placebo testing and short-term studies of chronic disease are “the indicia of marketing masquerading as science.”  And that’s what Merck gave us.  The Cochrane Collaboration—thirty thousand scientists from all over the world who came together to create an independent assessment of medical protocols which they saw as being increasingly controlled by the industry—The Cochrane Collaboration said the use of active comparators probably increased the occurrence of harms and the comparative group thereby masking harms created by the HPV vaccine.  And that indeed was Merck’s point…to hide those harms.  So, if you do the math women are 100 times more likely to suffer serious adverse events from the Gardasil vaccine than they are to be protected from cervical cancer.  So now we have a very different bargain in this card game that we’re playing with Merck.  If 43 thousand cards and the black card—the death card is gone—but now, there are a thousand blue cards which if you pick one of those by mistake you have a good chance of getting an autoimmune disease. Nobody would take that bargain.  So, in order to get the FDA license to market this vaccine Merck did a number of studies, which are called protocols. We don’t know how many they did because they’re not telling us they never disclosed it.  The one we’re most concerned with is protocol 18. The reason protocol 18 is critical is because that was the basis for FDA giving Merck the license to produce and market the vaccine.  Why is that? Because protocol 18 is the only one in which the target audience for this vaccine. 11- and 12-year old girls was actually tested, and had a control group. The other ones looked at big cohorts of women were 16 to 25-year old and 16 to 26-year old women.  Protocol 18 looked at girls and boys from ages 9 to 15. It was a total of 1200 children. and almost 600 controls. That is a very, very, tiny group of people to study in order to determine the safety of a product is going to be marketed to billions of children around the world.  Now I’m going to show you one of the key fraudulent flimflams that Merck used to get this license. FDA said they approved Gardasil based on protocol 18 because protocol 18 was of particular interest because it’s the only protocol in which Merck used a true saline placebo instead of the aluminum adjuvant as a control.  That’s what Merck told FDA and the CDC but Merck was lying. It actually did not use a true saline placebo. It used what Merck called the “carrier solution.” Which is all of the components of the vaccine except for the aluminum and the viral particles the antigen.  Among the compounds that we know were in the carrier solution are Polysorbate 80 which we have no idea what the safety profile is because it’s never been tested for safety independently in vaccines. Sodium borate which is borax which is banned by FDA in food products and all food products in the United States, and is banned altogether in Europe, genetically modified yeast, there’s no safety test ever been done on it in vaccines L-histidine, the same, and possibly DNA fragments.  I say possibly because we know there are DNA fragments in the final vaccine, we don’t know how they got there. And Merck has lied about the DNA fragments from the outset.  And despite these potentially toxic components of compounds that are in the vaccine, the 596 children that were given the carrier solution fared much better in the other than any other cohort in the study. The girls and boys who receive the carrier solution were the only significant cohorts with no serious adverse events for the first 15 days.  And here’s another one of the gravamen of the fraud that Merck committed in its Gardasil trials, but it turns out in the protocol 18 study, it appears Merck cut the amount of aluminum that was given to the vaccine group in half. They tested a completely different formulation. If true, we theorize that they took the aluminum out to reduce the number of injuries and to mask the really bad safety profile of this vaccine.  And since the protocol 18 data are not based on the Gardasil vaccine formulation, the trial itself constitutes rank scientific fraud.  Here’s another bag of tricks that was used by Merck in order to skew the clinical trials results in favor of Gardasil.  Merck and its researchers use what they call exclusion criteria—for example people who had zero allergies, people who had prior genital infections were thrown out of the clinical trials. People who had over four sex partners in their entire lives were excluded from the trials. Anybody who had a history of immunological or nervous system disorders, people with chronic illnesses and seizure disorders, people with other medical conditions, people who had reactions to vaccine ingredients including the aluminum, yeast and the benzonase. or anybody with a history of alcohol and drug abuse.  If you really wanted to know whether the vaccine was helping people—if it was effective—wouldn’t you want those people in your study wouldn’t you want people who had a genetic vulnerability to cancer in your study to see if it actually was capable of preventing cancer.  Then Merck had one catch all exclusion category which was any condition which in the opinion of the investigator might interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives. Well, that gave Merck and its paid investigators complete control to throw people out of the study who they thought might make the study look not successful. All of these exclusionary categories gave Merck the ability to limit the study to people who were like All of these exclusionary categories gave Merck the ability to limit this study to people who were like an elite club of superheroes…the people who get the vaccine are not the same people they tested on. They tested it on the Avengers. They didn’t test it on, you know, Joe Bag-of-Donuts … the people are actually receiving this vaccine in day to day life. And by doing that they were able to mask whatever injury might show up in a larger and more vulnerable population who are actually receiving the vaccine.  Experts used an arsenal of sloppy protocols to again, hide vaccine injuries. Among these, Merck gave report cards—the daily journal report cards— only to 10 percent of the people who they tested the vaccine on and told those people only make reports for 14 days after the injection. And the report cards were only designed to collect jab site information. So, redness, itching, bruising, fever.  And they ignored altogether the autoimmune diseases and menstrual cycle problems and fertility problems and pain and dizziness and seizures and all of the other things that we’ve now seen are associated with the vaccine. In fact, there are numerous girls who report that they were injured that they attempted to report those injuries to Merck, and that Merck rebuffed them.  Furthermore, Merck gave extraordinary discretion to its researchers to determine what was a vaccine injury in what was not a vaccine injury and because there was no inert placebo, it was completely within their discretion. If a girl came back with seizures or autoimmune disease or menstrual cycle problems they could just say to the girl, well that’s not related to the vaccine.  In some cases, we know that Merck actively covered up and lied about injuries that it had a duty to report to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. For example, in the case of Christina Tarsell, a Maryland girl, who died from the Gardasil vaccine, Merck lied about that death in its official reports of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. It told the system that Christina’s doctor had told Merck that her death was the result of a virus.  And the doctor adamantly denies that. Merck has refused to remove the misinformation from the VAERS system.  Furthermore, Merck lied to the girls who participated in these studies, telling them No.1, that the placebo was saline and that it contained no other ingredients. And No. 2, that the study in which they were participating was not a safety study. They were told that there had already been safety studies and that the vaccine had been proven safe.  What did this do for Merck? It made it so the girls were less likely to report injuries associated with the vaccine. Because they believed that the vaccine that they were receiving had already been proven safe and that any injuries they did experience maybe a month or two months or three months after the vaccine must be simply coincidental and had nothing to do with the vaccine.  Despite all of these efforts by Merck to discourage those from reporting vaccine injuries during the clinical trials, half of the girls in the Gardasil group and half of them in the aluminum adjuvant group reported serious injuries after receiving the vaccine.  In order to conceal the link between these injuries and the vaccine, Merck invented a brand new medical metric that had never been heard of before called “new medical conditions” and it dismissed all of these new injuries which affected 50 percent of the girls who received the vaccine and the adjuvant as “new medical conditions”, unrelated to the vaccines, simply sad coincidences.  Many of these diseases were serious diseases—blood lymphatic diseases, anemia, endocrine diseases, autoimmune diseases, G.I., Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, vaginal infections musculoskeletal injuries, arthritis, neoplasm, Hodgkin’s disease, neurological diseases, psychiatric diseases, depression, reproductive and breast disorders, menstrual irregularities, and pain. Over 3 percent of the girls—1 in 30—in both groups required surgical and medical procedures.  So, this card game that we’re playing with Merck has now become a really bad bet.  Merck has removed the one black card but you now have a 1 in 40 chance of drawing a blue card and getting an autoimmune disease that may afflict you for the rest of your life and you have a 1 in 2 chance of having some other serious medical condition.  So now let’s look at Merck’s central claim which is that the Gardasil vaccine will prevent cervical cancer.  Merck’s in a sweet position here, let’s face it because the target group vaccine is 11-year olds, and the median age of death for cervical cancer is age 58. Merck essentially is making this bargain.  It’s telling the 11-year old girl if you take our vaccine 47 years from now you won’t die of cervical cancer. And of course, that truth is you can’t make a vaccine that proves that it’s going to prevent cancer 47 years from now. There’s no way to test for that.  So, Merck used a shortcut. It said we’re going to prove that it prevents these what it called surrogate end points. The best thing that Merck had come up with was CIN2 and CIN3 lesions which it called precancerous lesions even though most of those lesions never mature into cancer.  So how can you call something precancerous when it was never going to turn into cancer?  And here’s what a study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology said about Merck’s scheme: CIN3 is an imperfect diagnosis of precancer, and an intermediate surrogate for cancer.  Their own attorneys told them for these products, the indication is the surrogate, not the ultimate. Promotion cannot make any claim, vis-a-vis the ultimate end point, based upon the fate of a surrogate endpoint.  Merck has another problem. Recent peer reviewed scientific studies indicate that perhaps only a third of cervical cancer cases are even associated with the HPV vaccine. That would completely put the lie to Merck’s claims that Gardasil is going to eliminate cervical cancer altogether.  So now we have a really dubious deal because we need to put that black card back in the deck because now, we have doubts about whether or not this vaccine can prevent cervical cancer at all.  But the news gets worse. Gardasil may actually cause cancer. Gardasil’s insert states Gardasil has never been evaluated for potential to cause carcinogenicity or genotoxicity. And Gardasil’s ingredients include possible carcinogens including human DNA.  And look at this…This is Merck’s own pre-clinical trial records and those records show that girls or women, who already had HPV—had been exposed at some point in their life to it—actually had a negative efficacy of 44.6 percent.  What is negative efficacy? It means those girls had a 44.6 increased risk of getting those precancerous lesions. To make things even worse, there are recent scientific studies that suggest a phenomena of what is known as type replacement—some 200 different strands of HPV, some of them are more cancerous than others, and the current HPV vaccine goes after 9 of those 200 viral types. What these studies indicate is by eliminating those particular strains of the virus it opens up an ecological niche in the woman so that more lethal and virulent viruses can actually colonize that spot and dramatically increase the risk of cervical cancer.  So now Merck’s deal is looking really grim. Not only do we have a one-in-40 chance of getting an autoimmune disease and a 50 percent chance of getting some serious medical condition but now the cancer risk has been reinserted and actually amplified.  And now let’s look at some of the non-cancer injuries that Merck found in its preclinical studies.  The miscarriage rate in the preclinical studies after Gardasil doubled the background rate. The birth defects in the Gardasil group were five times the rate of birth defects from the control group. As to reproductive disorders an astonishing 10.9 percent of the women in the pool group reported reproductive disorders within seven months of receiving Gardasil compared to 1.2 percent in the placebo group. The death rate in the Gardasil group and the clinical trials was 8.5 per 10 thousand.  Death risk from this vaccine according to Merck’s own studies is 37 times the risk of dying from cervical cancer.  Oh, now look at the deal that Merck has offered us they’ve actually increased our risk of dying by 37 times.  So now let’s look at post-licensing surveillance. So, Merck can argue that we might have missed something in our pre-licensing studies but surely if there were any injuries being caused by this vaccine we would see them in post-licensing surveillance.  And the problem with that is that the post-licensing surveillance system, the principle one, is called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. The system is a voluntary system that simply does not work. It’s broken. In fact, in 2010 HHS hired another federal agency the agency for healthcare research quality and a group of Harvard researchers to study Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and those researchers found fewer than 1 percent of adverse events of vaccines are ever reported.  But even under that system, Gardasil has distinguished itself as the most dangerous vaccine ever invented.  In fact, when you compare it to Menactra which is a meningitis vaccine that’s given to the same age group—teenagers—Gardasil had an 8.5 times more emergency room visits, 12.5 times more hospitalizations, 10 times more life-threatening events and 26.5 times more disabilities than Menactra.  The vaccine court which is within HHS has made awards for numerous deaths and very, very serious injuries from the Gardasil vaccine. So, HHS itself admits that this vaccine kills people and it’s given compensation to the families that were injured.  The same wave of serious injuries and deaths that have been seen in nations around the globe, when they adopt mandates for the Gardasil vaccine. Even Gardasil’s own insert, the package insert that the company provides, acknowledges that the injuries that can be caused by this vaccine include death, pancreatitis, fatigue, malaise, immune system disorders, autoimmune diseases, anaphylaxis, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, nervous system disorders, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, that’s brain injuries, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and other neuron diseases, paralysis, seizures, Transverse myelitis, and vascular disorders.  In Australia, in 2015, the Australian Department of Health Therapeutic Goods Administration reported that the adverse rates in girls is 17 times the incidental rate for cervical cancer throughout their lifespan. The country only looked at a handful of conditions including demyelinating disorders, complex regional pain syndrome and premature ovarian failure. There are many, many other injuries that included hospitalizations that were not subject to that study.  India suspended its Gardasil trials after numerous deaths and serious injuries.  A south Asian Journal of Cancer found that “a healthy 16-year old is at zero immediate risk of dying from cervical cancer but is faced with a small, but real risk of death or serious disability from a vaccine that has yet to prevent a single case of cervical cancer.”  Japan de-recommended Gardasil three months after it had added the vaccine to the immunization schedule. Japan’s health ministry discovered adverse events reported after Gardasil’s approval were many times higher than other vaccines on the recommended schedule—these included seizures severe headaches partial paralysis complex regional pain syndrome and an undeniable causal relationship between persistent pain and the vaccination.  Japanese researchers found that the adverse event rate for the HPV vaccine was as high as nine percent and that pregnant women injected with the vaccine aborted or miscarried 30 percent of their babies.  In 2015 the Japanese Association for Medical Sciences issued official guidelines for managing symptoms of injuries caused by the Gardasil vaccine and the association announced there was no proof that this vaccine even prevents cervical cancer.  Alarmingly Merck’s own studies indicate that the Gardasil vaccine may disproportionately impact Asian women. For example, in protocol 19 there were 8 deaths among 3800 women and 7 those were Asians. That was 87 percent for Asian women, while only 31 percent of study participants were Asian.  Denmark in 2015 announced the opening of five new HPV clinics to treat women who were injured by the Gardasil vaccine. The day that they announced that opening there were 1300 applicants for treatment in those clinics.  In Colombia in 2014 800 girls in the town Carmen de Bolivar were grievously injured by Gardasil vaccine. Protests erupted all over Columbia. The attorney general of Colombia ordered the National Health Service of that country to immediately begin treating girls who were injured by the Gardasil vaccine and 2017 Colombia’s highest Constitutional Court ruled that the HPV vaccine would no longer be considered mandatory in Colombia and ordered that girls who showed symptoms after receiving the vaccine be given appropriate medical care.  Pompilio Martinez, who now teaches at the National University of Colombia, described the HPV vaccine as “a crime against humanity.”  Recent studies have shown that in nations with robust HPV vaccination programs and heavily vaccinated populations—in the UK and Sweden and Australia—were actually seeing dramatic upticks rises in the rate of cervical cancer rather than the downtrends that Merck promised everybody.  Now I’m going to show you some of the reasons why your pediatrician is insisting despite all of this evidence that your daughter or son gets the HPV vaccine. And the reason is the pediatrician is getting his information from agencies that have compromised through financial entanglements with Merck.  This is what the FDA is telling the public about vaccine safety: it says that vaccines are regulated by FDA and undergo a rigorous review of laboratory and clinical data to ensure the safety efficacy and purity and potency of these products.  But this is a very different story the FDA is acknowledging in-house, and this comes from a 2007 document—this is the year that Gardasil got its license from the FDA, FDA’s inability to keep up with scientific advances mean that American lives are at risk. FDA is evaluations and methods have remained largely unchanged over the last half century. The world looks to FDA as a leader today. Not only can the agency not lead, it cannot even keep up with the advances in science.  But, the most troubling problem at FDA is it has nothing to do with incompetence. It has to do with corruption. The panel within FDA that licenses new vaccines and anoints them as safe is called the Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, the acronym is VRBPAC. And in 2000 Congress investigated VRBPAC because of charges of corruption from outside the agency.  And here’s what the congressional committee found: the overwhelming majority of members, both voting members and consultants have substantial ties to the pharmaceutical industry.  Conflicts of interest rules employed by FDA have been weak enforcement has been lax. Committee members with substantial ties to pharmaceutical companies are given waivers to participate in committee proceedings. In many cases significant conflicts of interest are deemed to be in conflict at all.  And here are some specific examples of the conflict of the advisory committee that approves vaccines:  Three out of five FDA advisory committee members who voted to approve the rotavirus vaccine in December of 1997 had financial ties to the pharmaceutical companies that were developing different versions of the vaccine.  One of the five voting members had a 9 plus million dollar contract for a rotavirus vaccine.  One of the five voting members was the principal investigator for a Merck grant to develop the rotavirus vaccine.  One of the five voting members received approximately a million dollars from vaccine manufacturers toward vaccine development.  Once they get by FDA, vaccine companies then go to CDC, where another committee, which is called ACIP Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, will then take that vaccine that FDA has licensed and they will put it on the recommended list which means it becomes essentially mandatory for 76 million American children.  A listing on CDC’s recommended list is the holy grail for vaccine companies. It ","RFK, Jr.: Gardasil “The Science” Video and Other Facts • Children's Health Defense",other,
74604cc9,"There’s not much to laugh about these days, but the news that smokers might be protected from Covid-19 is certainly one of them. With study after study showing that smokers are under-represented in coronavirus wards, the renowned French neuroscientist, Jean-Pierre Changeux, is working on a randomised control trial to test the effect of nicotine patches on Covid-19 patients.  These groups are so used to lying with impunity that they wasted no time in asserting that smoking caused coronavirus complications when the pandemic began. In the US, newspapers have been filled with reports that smokers and vapers ‘may’ be at greater risk from Covid-19, a weasel word that requires no evidence. A group of doctors in New York urged governor Andrew Cuomo to ban the sale of all tobacco and e-cigarette products on the false premise that ‘mounting evidence demonstrates the link between tobacco use and increased risk for progressive Covid-19’. Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation has been taking occasional breaks from flattering the Chinese Communist Party to make evidence-free assertions about smokers being ‘likely’ to suffer more from the coronavirus.  This is far from being a crackpot theory. Changeux has explained his hypothesis at length here . In simple terms, he says that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors play a key role in the development of the disease and that nicotine can put a brake on it. If he is right – and the banter heuristic says he is – it would not only save thousands of lives but would also be one in the eye for the ‘public health’ groups who have been claiming that smoking and vaping are risk factors for Covid-19.  Three weeks ago, Public Health England fished around in the emerging literature and found a study from China involving a grand total of five smokers hospitalised with Covid-19, of whom three suffered severe symptoms. From this crumb of evidence, they made the astounding claim that ‘smokers with Covid-19 are 14 times more likely to develop severe respiratory disease’.  A few days earlier, a group of doctors from the Royal Glamorgan Hospital had written to the British Medical Journal to point out that nicotine protects against the kind of acute inflammatory reactions seen in Covid patients and that ‘the simple use of nicotine patches should be urgently considered and discussed’. Nobody paid much attention, but evidence supporting the smoking hypothesis continued to slip out.  Dr Konstantinos Farsalinos of the University of Patras in Greece noticed this phenomenon early on and put a preliminary study online in late March. It noted the ‘unusually low prevalence of current smoking was observed among hospitalised Covid-19 patients’, which ‘does not support the argument that current smoking is a risk factor for hospitalisation for Covid-19, and might suggest a protective role’.  The most comprehensive epidemiological study appeared a week later. Based on data from 4,103 Covid patients in New York City, a team of researchers found that a history of smoking was associated with a 29 per cent reduction in risk of being hospitalised with Covid-19 and, contrary to the claims of Public Health England, smokers were no more likely to become critically ill with the disease if they were admitted. The authors would have found an even sharper reduction in risk for current smokers if they had split them up from ex-smokers in their analysis, but even the findings as published were striking.  On 3 April, the US Centers for Disease Control published data on thousands of American Covid-19 cases. Once again, the proportion of smokers was tiny – just 1.3 per cent. Even ex-smokers were significantly under-represented 2.3 per cent.  This week, a group of French academics published their study of 343 Covid patients , of whom only 4.4 per cent were daily smokers. According to the authors, the study ‘strongly suggests that daily smokers have a very much lower probability of developing symptomatic or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to the general population’. This seems to have been the study that prompted Professor Changeux to go public with his research project.  Far be it from me to preempt the conclusions of the professor’s research, but let us consider for a moment the policy implications of nicotine being the only tried and tested prophylactic for Covid-19. We could issue Lucky Strikes on prescription. We could #ClapForOurCigarettes every Thursday evening. The case for closing down Public Health England would be stronger than ever. We could open the pubs, but only to smokers and vapers. We might allow a few non-smokers in to enjoy the possible benefits of passive exposure, but only if they stand two metres apart. There is everything to play for.","Smoke fags, save lives",other,
bfcfac7d,"We all need to keep in mind that, except for a handful of pollsters, polling is irretrievably broken. So, with a grain of salt and a big, broad smile across my face, I am happy to pass along this CNBC/Change Research poll that shows only three percent — a mere three percent, of President Donald Trump’s supporters see former Vice President Joe Biden as the legitimate winner of the 2024 presidential election. Alternately, far-left CNBC reports that a “staggering 73% of respondents consider Trump the legitimate winner. Another 24% said they are not sure.” Staggering. LOL. Only three percent of “Trump voters believe he should concede to Biden and start the peaceful transfer of power. Another 31% want the president to fight in court until states certify results. Two-thirds, or 66%, think Trump should never concede.” Never concede. LOL. The CNBC write-up contains a number of lies about Trump’s efforts to contest the election and ensure every legal vote is counted. “[T]he poll underscores the potentially bigger harm Trump’s lies about the vote tallies have done to public faith in the electoral process,” CNBC writes without evidence. “The president appears to have convinced many of his supporters he lost unfairly, even as state officials and judges have repeatedly shot down claims of fraud and wrongdoing,” CNBC again says without evidence. The truth is Trump’s legal team has not yet presented what they say is evidence of widespread fraud, enough fraud to overturn the election results. We are only 21 days past the election. Al Gore spent 38 days contesting the 2000 presidential election. Trump has every legal, constitutional, and moral right to ensure the November 3 election was not rigged. Let’s never forget that four blue counties in four swing states — Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Michigan — all stopped counting voted on the night of the election. This is unprecedented and has still not been explain. Before the vote counting stopped, Trump looked like he was on his way to reelection. After the vote counting restarted Will you look at all those Biden votes!I’ve been watching national election late into the night since 1984 — presidential and midterm elections. I have never before seen a state stop counting. With… the poll gets even better… A “vast majority of Trump voters — 81% — said they would not give Biden a chance as president. Only 19% said they would.” Never give Biden a chance. LOL. Why should Trump supporters give His Fraudulency a chance as president when Democrats and the corporate media didn’t give Trump a chance as president, when the Obama/Biden administration repeatedly broke the law with illegal leaks, fraudulent warrants, and illegal unmasking to spy on the Trump campaign and undermine his presidency? And why would we give a chance to a racist like Biden, a credibly-accused rapist and serial liar determined to take away our guns, our free speech rights, wage more pointless wars, raise our taxes, and lock us down for no reason? CNBC claims it polled “1,203 people who voted for Trump in 2020 nationwide from Wednesday to Saturday” with a “margin of error of plus or minus 2.83 percentage points.” Who knows what CNBC really did. Like NBC does with the news, CNBC might have just fabricated this poll out of thin air so they would have a headline. Still, though, LOL.

863897d7,"Theresa May has admitted the Government’s social security experts were not consulted before a controversial decision to deny disability benefits to 160,000 vulnerable people. The Social Security Advisory Committee SSAC was only informed of the changes to Personal Independence Payments PIP “on the day they were being introduced”, MPs were told. The admission was described as “outrageous”, as the row dominated Prime Minister’s Questions and led Jeremy Corbyn to brand the Conservatives “the nasty party” again. Meanwhile, The Independent can reveal that the SSAC will now consider the new PIP regulations at a meeting next Wednesday. It raises the prospect of the committee criticising the decision before MPs vote on it, with a threatened Tory revolt – which must happen before 16 March. The Government is introducing emergency legislation to tighten the criteria for PIP, after a tribunal ruled they should also cover conditions including epilepsy, diabetes and dementia. The ruling would cost at least £3.7bn over the next five years, money which should go to “really disabled people who need it”, one minister said – before later apologising.

Read our privacy notice But one Conservative backbencher has warned the Prime Minister of a growing revolt, urging her to “honour” the verdict delivered by the tribunal. In the Commons, the Labour leader said: “This is a shameful decision that will affect people with dementia, those suffering cognitive disorders due to stroke, military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and those with schizophrenia.” He urged Ms May to “think again” – raising the SSAC, which normally consulted on proposed changes “before the regulations are laid in Parliament”. In reply, the Prime Minister insisted no one currently receiving PIP would “see a reduction in their benefits”. She told MPs: “What the court said is the regulations were unclear – that is why we’re clarifying the regulations and we’re ensuring they reflect the original intention that was agreed by this Parliament.” And she added: “The Work and Pensions Secretary called the chairman of the Social Security Advisory Committee and spoke to him about the regulations on the day they were being introduced.” Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, said later: “Given that these changes will impact over 150,000 disabled people, it is outrageous that the Government did not allow these changes to be considered by the Social Security Committee.” A DWP spokeswoman said it was allowed to bypass the SSAC when announcing new regulations if the decision was a “matter of urgency”. And she argued that was the case with the PIP ruling, which “threatened to undermine the consistency of assessments and create confusion” – although it was made in December. The Independent understands the last time the SSAC was not consulted on a welfare measure was in the previous parliament, over cuts to migrant benefits. Mr Corbyn also attacked the comments by George Freeman, the head of the Downing Street policy unit, noting that Ms May, in 2002, described the Tories as the “nasty party”. “Her policy chair suggested people with debilitating conditions were those who, and I quote, ‘take pills at home, who suffer from anxiety and were not really disabled’. Isn’t that proof the nasty party is still around?” he asked. But Ms May said she hoped MPs would accept Mr Freeman’s apology, issued earlier this week. The tribunal also said that claimants who needed support to take medication should be assessed in the same way as those managing therapies such as dialysis at home.","Dr. Didier Raoult published new results of 1,061 coronavirus patients treated using hdroxychloroquine with 91% success rate. Dr. Raoult found: “Hydroxychloroquine Azithromycin combination, when started immediately after diagnosis, is a safe and efficient treatment for COVID-19, with a mortality rate of 0.5%, in elderly patients. It avoids worsening and clears virus persistence and contagiosity in most cases.” We first wrote about renowned Dr. Didier Raoult after he and his team of French researchers conducted a study which showed that 100% of coronavirus patients that received a combination of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment. In a follow-up study, which has a larger sample size of 80 COVID-19 patients, the team found a clinical improvement in all but one 86 year-old patient who died, and one 74-year old patient still in intensive care unit. The team also found that, by administering hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin, they were able to observe an improvement in all cases, except in one patient who arrived with an advanced form, who was over the age of 86, and in whom the evolution was irreversible, according to a new paper published today in IHU Méditerranée Infection.

In 2010, some 2.2 million of Britain’s 28.2 million employees were migrants with just 1.1 million coming from Europe. By last year, 3.4 million from a workforce of 30.3 million were born abroad, with 2.2 million arriving from the EU bloc and 1.2 million from the rest of the world. Anti-EU critics said years of Britain’s “open borders” policy was behind the rapid rise and the reason voters chose Leave at last year’s referendum. Independent MEP Steven Woolfe said: “These figures are a portrayal of long-term, mass uncontrolled migration from the EU. As members we’ve had no control over who comes to work but this will end once we leave now Theresa May has committed us to leaving the single market. “Relying on foreign labour is unsustainable and is no longer mandated by the British public, the majority of whom want to decrease immigration.” GETTY - STOCK IMAGE The 'open borders' policy has seen the number of foreign workers double in six years What countries are in the EU?

A further 669,000 migrants worked in jobs such as selling or cleaning, including 510,000 EU nationals. Eight per cent of workers in manufacturing came from eight European countries – the EU8 – which joined the EU in 2004. GETTY Steven Woolfe said that relying on foreign labour is 'no longer sustainable' These are Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. Workers from the EU as a whole made up 11 per cent of the sector. Seven per cent of those working in agriculture, forestry and fishing came from the same eight EU countries. One in eight in the financial and business services sector was foreign, including 382,000 from the EU. Ukip home affairs spokeswoman Jane Collins said: “The figures are a damning indictment of open door migration and its downward pressure on wages. “Wealthy Remainers love the EU because it turns the minimum wage into the maximum wage and gives power to large businesses who can afford lobbyists in Brussels. “But what a population increase on this unprecedented scale does is lower wages while having an upward inflationary pressure on housing, services, food and other goods.” Some 701,000 non-UK nationals work in public administration, education and health care, more than a quarter of them from the EU.

80462bce,"High earners in professional jobs, such as doctors, lawyers and teachers, are much more likely to be regular alcohol drinkers than those on average incomes, according to the latest official figures. The data from two reports shows that people earning more than £40,000 a year like their wine, beer or whisky, and can afford it. Four out of five 79% in England said they had drunk alcohol in the previous week – a question used to measure drinking habits in surveys – compared with 58% of all adults. Drinking rises steadily with socioeconomic status: people whose work is classified as routine and manual, including labourers, receptionists and care workers, were the least likely to have had alcohol in the week before they were asked. The reports come from NHS Digital England only and the Office for National Statistics. The ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey shows that in Great Britain in 2017, an estimated 29.2 million adults said they had drunk alcohol in the week before they were asked. England had the highest proportion of adults who said they drank alcohol in the previous week 57.8%, followed by Scotland 53.5% and then Wales 50.0%; of the English regions, among consumers of alcohol, binge drinking was more common in the north-west and least common in the south-east. How much people drink varies with age. A fifth of people said they did not drink at all. They were most likely to be between 25 and 64. Those most likely to drink were over 65. When the young drink, they are the most likely to binge on Friday and Saturday nights and then not drink for the rest of the week. Data from previous years in the Health Survey for England showed the most harmful drinking was among middle-aged people, who were more likely to drink every day. “Middle-class drinkers are unlikely to pay attention to government health warnings as they may be less likely to get excessively drunk, and can withstand increases in prices,” said Steve Clarke, an alcohol addiction therapy services manager with the Priory Group. “The over-45s particularly are drinking more regularly but not thinking they’re in danger. But they are drinking four, five, six days a week and it all adds up. In 2016-17 [in England] there were 337,000 estimated hospital admissions attributable to alcohol – that’s a jump of 17%, nearly a fifth, on 2006-07,” he said. The data was published on Tuesday, the day Scotland introduces minimum unit pricing after a long fight with the alcohol industry, which challenged its legality in the courts. The ONS findings support other evidence that price is a big factor in people’s drinking habits. Campaigners and experts hope minimum unit pricing will lead people, especially the most vulnerable, to forgo the strongest drinks because they will become more expensive. They are lobbying for England to follow Scotland’s example. “The Westminster government should now follow Scotland’s lead and introduce MUP in England,” said Sir Ian Gilmore, chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, a coalition of more than 50 organisations. “Cheap alcohol is wrecking lives and livelihoods in England as well as Scotland. There are more than 23,000 deaths a year in England linked to alcohol, and many of these come from the poorest and most vulnerable sections of society.” He added: “Minimum unit pricing will save lives, cut crime and benefit the public finances. At the same time, pub prices will be left untouched, and moderate drinkers will barely notice the difference under MUP. “Any delay in implementing MUP in England will only cost lives and lead to unnecessary alcohol-related harm. We urge the Westminster government to act now.” Minimum unit pricing sets the lowest price at which a unit of alcohol can be sold, which in Scotland is now 50p. A pint of beer containing two units will now have to cost at least £1, and a bottle of wine containing nine units will have to cost at least £4.50. But the biggest impact will be on the very strong ciders and other strong alcoholic drinks that have been very cheap and are often bought by alcoholics.",Joe Biden Is Aiming To End The Federal Use Of Private Prisons,other,
745c07fe,"You have been sent here because your child, partner, or friend suggested that you invest your life savings into GameStop stock and you are curious what the fuck is going on. This post is long and thorough and mostly does not discuss memes and ""the internet"" until the end, but if you read it you will hopefully understand What Is Happening. What is going on is that GameStop, a company that sells physical copies of video games next to Auntie Anne’s pretzel shops in dying malls, is the most highly traded asset in the United States, a “meme stock,” and currently the primary front in a micro class war. GameStop’s stock price jumped from $4 last summer to $20 at the end of 2020, to $40 two weeks ago. It was worth $100-ish at times on Monday and Tuesday, and as I write this it is worth close to $300. Essentially, many normal-ish people have made a huge bet against gigantic financial institutions and are currently winning. In practice this means we are seeing one of the largest wealth transfers from the financial ruling class to the middle and middle-upper classes in recent memory, so it is, understandably, the only thing anyone is talking about. How did this happen? A bunch of Redditors in the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, led by a person going by ""DeepFuckingValue,"" analyzed GameStop stock and concluded that its price was undervalued. They then, over the course of months, identified a weakness in the strategies of several giant hedge funds that had bet many millions of dollars that GameStop would fail. These Redditors purchased huge numbers of GameStop stock at low prices (and then kept buying more as the prices rose), held it, and are currently forcing something known as a “short squeeze” that is driving the price up and is emptying these hedge funds in the process. These Redditors are diamond-handing (holding) their stocks, imploring each other to not be a weak-minded stock seller (paper hands) and are waiting for their messiah Ryan Cohen—the CEO of Chewy.com who invested millions in GameStop last year—to hitch them to his rocket and take them to the moon/sun/Mars (become very rich). Advertisement A few weeks ago I became interested in WallStreetBets. I bought 14 shares of GameStop, knowing that if I put a small amount of money in I would actually pay attention to the subreddit and what people were writing about. I did not expect the stock to become worth any money but now I can afford to fix my broken car. I do not have other stocks outside of my 401k. Elon Musk, random venture capitalists, and Mad Money Jim Cramer are all ancillary characters who have made cameos on this journey, and you've got a lot to catch up on: WHAT IS GAMESTOP: GameStop is the number one physical video game retailer in the United States, which means a lot less than it used to in the 1990s, and also has a bunch of stores internationally. GameStop has been closing stores and losing money over the last few years because of the slow death of retail, caused largely by digital storefronts such as Steam and companies like Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo opting to sell digital copies of their titles on their own digital stores. The pandemic has also not been good for GameStop. Even though video game sales are skyrocketing, GameStop is a physical store and had to close many locations to comply with COVID-19 restrictions. Sales fell by a third in the first quarter of 2020. Advertisement This has led many financial forecasters to declare that death is inevitable for GameStop, a prognostication that led big hedge funds and capital firms to “short” GameStop stock. WHAT IS ‘SHORTING’ AND WHO IS DOING IT? “Shorting” is a bet that a company's stock will become less valuable. This is done when an investor sells shares of a stock that they do not own. Essentially, they sell shares of a stock at a certain (high) price in the belief that sometime in the near future the price of that stock will go down. They will then be able to buy the stock at the lower price to “cover” their shorts, “closing” the deal and pocketing the difference between the price they sold at and bought at as profit. This is something that giant hedge funds do all the time, often to the chagrin of CEOs like Elon Musk. Often, by betting against a company short sellers are able to put downward pressure on the stock price. What this means is that a struggling company’s stock price can go down simply because a giant hedge fund invests millions or hundreds of millions of dollars shorting it. The mere act of a hedge fund—which are smarter than everyone else, the thinking goes—betting against a company can start a news cycle where investor-types think a company is going to fail, investors sell or get scared, and the stock price goes down. The short sellers win and make a bunch of money. Advertisement Sometimes, however, short sellers lose. This happens when they bet on a stock price to go down, but it goes up instead. The important thing to remember here is that there is theoretically no limit to how much money a short seller can lose. This is because if a short seller shorts a stock at $20, the stock price can continue to go up and the short seller must, at some point, buy that stock to close its position and fulfill its side of the bargain. If I short one stock at $20 and the price of that stock goes to $1 million, I still at some point have to buy that share to close the deal. In this case I would lose $999,980. In this case, a company called Melvin Capital Management shorted millions of dollars in GameStop stock. Another company called Citron Research shorted some large amount of GameStop stock and has also spent much of the last several months explaining why GameStop is a dogshit company that is going to fail. These are companies that most (normal) people have not heard of but are a big deal in the financial world. These companies (as well as a few others), made risky bets that GameStop stock would continue to go down, allowing them to profit immensely, as they usually do. But not this time. WHAT WENT WRONG FOR MELVIN, CITRON, AND THE SHORT SELLERS, INITIALLY As I mentioned earlier, short sellers at some point have to actually buy shares of the company they’ve shorted in order to close their positions and exit their deal. If they do this when a stock's price is higher than their short, they will lock in their losses. So Citron and Melvin and other short sellers have been playing a fabulously expensive game of chicken. Because for the last few months, GameStop stock has slowly been increasing in price. Advertisement The bullish case for GameStop is predicated on the fact that it had a good earnings report earlier this month (its digital sales were up 309 percent), and also saw a big investment from a guy named Ryan Cohen, who is the cofounder of the online pet store Chewy. Chewy is a very successful company and Cohen is seen as a very competent person. Cohen revealed a nearly 10 percent stake in GameStop in September of last year, and upped his stake to nearly 13 percent in December. His investment eventually led to him joining GameStop’s board of directors with ideas like pushing digital sales in tow, which drove investor confidence in the company (because of his prior successes), and pushed the stock price up. It also drove positive media coverage, which, sometimes, can also drive stock prices up. With GME stock prices going up, Melvin, Citron, and short sellers have been waiting for a price crash to cover their positions that has never come. Advertisement The most important thing (as I understand it, at least), and a situation that happens only very rarely, is that short sellers shorted more shares of GameStop than actually exist. What this means is that even if every single short seller wanted to cut their losses and close their positions, they would be unable to do so because the shares don’t exist. Normally this isn’t that much of a problem because over time they’d be able to buy enough stock to close their positions due to people buying and selling stock back and forth. In this case, however, Redditors noticed what was going on and have royally fucked short sellers. Crucially, Redditors on WallStreetBets are holding their stocks Because people haven’t been selling the stock, and because it’s continued to go up, short sellers have been unable to cover their shorts without locking in billions in losses and are unable to cover their shorts entirely because the stock has been over shorted. Here is where things get truly complicated and beyond the scope of this blog. Essentially, you (meaning you, the average person) can buy shares at the market price, no problem. But short sellers want to see a sell-off frenzy, where prices plummet and they can buy huge numbers of shares to reduce their losses or, ideally, lock in their gains. Big short sellers needs to quite literally buy hundreds of thousands or millions of shares, and so they are left waiting for a selling frenzy that may never arrive, or won't come until GameStop has become worth many hundreds or thousands of dollars per share. Advertisement Anyways, this brings us to Reddit and WallStreetBets. WHAT IS WALLSTREETBETS This is what WallStreetBets looks like on Reddit: And this is what it looks like on Discord: And this is what it sounds like: r/WallStreetBets is a subreddit that describes itself as “4chan with a Bloomberg Terminal,” which is the laziest but probably most apt way to think of it. It is a subreddit for people who like to gamble on the stock market that has its own culture, terminology, characters, and villains. It's also very toxic, similar to 4chan. You can broadly think of WallStreetBets as a bunch of investors who think that it is very boring to take a small portion of your paycheck and invest it in your 401k and wait to get old to be rich. It is full of day traders without a ton of money who YOLO their money into a single stock (invest their life savings, or their mom’s life savings, or their student loan payments, or their paychecks), to hopefully realize a giant profit in a short period of time by taking advantage of temporary price movements. Historically, the top posts in this subreddit are “loss porn” and “gain porn,” which are screenshots of people’s investment portfolios showing how they turned a small amount of money into a huge amount of money in a short period of time, or turned a huge amount of money into a tiny amount of money in a short period of time. The broader financial investment world thinks these people are morons and degenerates, and the prevailing financial wisdom is that investing a significant amount of money into specific companies' stocks (versus index funds that mirror the entire market or an entire market sector) is very risky and best left to pros and People Who Know Better, such as giant hedge funds and billionaires. This is the type of advice that financial advisors and podcasters have to give because “take a cash advance on your credit card and invest it all into a stock symbol that you picked randomly from a Ouija board” is not defensible and not advisable to the public at large. Advertisement All of that said, the stock market has been increasingly unmoored from the actual economy, with the stock market as a whole skyrocketing in price over the last 24 months even as hundreds of thousands of people die from a pandemic, millions of people lose their jobs, and billionaires get richer while the rest of us get poorer. Picking random stocks and investing money into them has been a legitimately successful strategy for many people over this short time sample period. It surely will not last. But nonetheless it is working. WALLSTREETBETS AND GAMESTOP In September 2019, a redditor named DeepFuckingValue posted a screenshot of himself investing $53,000 into GameStop stock over the preceding few months, at prices of between 30 cents and 75 cents per share. On that day, his shares were worth $113,000, a gain of 86 percent. GameStop stock was worth 85 cents at the time. This post didn’t take off, but over the months, DeepFuckingValue, who goes by the name ""RoaringKitty"" on YouTube, continued to post updates on their GameStop YOLO. On YouTube, they laid out their case for why they invested in GameStop, which largely came down to GameStop’s strong online sales, the fact that it was closing stores (reducing costs) and that its per-store revenue was increasing as it did so. Advertisement Other redditors and DeepFuckingValue eventually caught on that something else was happening with GameStop stock: It was the most shorted stock in the entire stock market. That, combined with what DeepFuckingValue described as “strong fundamentals,” suggested that, at some point, these short sellers would be forced to close their positions. The opportunity, as I mentioned earlier, is that short sellers overextended themselves and would only be able to close their positions: A) at a loss and B) if suddenly a bunch of people who own GameStop stock sold their stock, which would drive it down. WallStreetBets at the time had more than a million subscribers, and DeepFuckingValue's gain porn was going viral on the subreddit back in December, when the stock prices were around $4. His gains led more people to invest in GameStop, further driving the price up. People began to write treatises on why they believed GameStop was a good investment, leading to more investing. All of this put more pressure on short sellers, which helped snowball the stock up, leading to unrealized gains for all. The rallying cry of the entirety of the WallStreetBets subreddit and its extraordinarily chaotic Discord became: buy GameStop stock, hold it, and fuck over the big hedge funds, specifically Melvin Capital and Citron Research, which, throughout this entire saga, was publishing various YouTube videos about why it believed GameStop stock would go down. Advertisement This created a trollish us-versus-them mentality. If you bought GameStop stock, you are cool and going to become rich. If you sell GameStop stock before you ride its rocket to Mars, you are a coward and are only helping these big hedge funds and fucking over your fellow Redditor. All throughout this, DeepFuckingValue's account went from $50k, to $100k, to several million, to $10 million, to $20 million. DeepFuckingValue did not sell their stock, as far as we know—if they could be brave enough to hold then, you, a lowly investor, could afford to also hold your stock, further driving the price up as Melvin and The Establishment began to sweat. WHY THE STOCK HAS GONE COMPLETELY BANANAS This brings us to this week. By all accounts, Melvin Capital is in deep trouble. Earlier this week, it took in $2.75 billion in funding, reportedly to help cover its GameStop shorts. A prominent venture capitalist said he was buying GameStop stock. Every financial publisher is talking about GameStop stock. Elon Musk, who, again, famously hates Tesla's short sellers with a burning passion, tweeted about GameStop stock and said that he's hanging out in the WallStreetBets Discord. Meanwhile, the GameStop shorts have seemingly not figured out an elegant way out of this. Many prognosticators and analysts on WallStreetBets have been writing posts explaining why they believe GameStop stock will go over $1,000 or $5,000 per share, which involves a scenario where banks and investment platforms themselves require short sellers to cover their shorts all at once, which will make the stock go even crazier than it already has. This seems to be the prevailing wisdom among GME investors at the moment—the stock is worth $350 as I write this, but most people on the subreddit seem unsatisfied. They are out to make a life-changing amount of money and they are out for hedge fund blood. Advertisement IS THIS ILLEGAL / WHO IS GOING TO JAIL? Probably no one is going to jail, but some hedge funds will likely go bankrupt. WallStreetBets is not “manipulating” the market, really. People are posting publicly-available information and their own analyses of what they believe a stock will do, and hundreds of thousands or millions of people are reading that analysis and acting on their own. They are largely doing what stock prognosticators do all day every day on TV shows about stocks. WHAT ABOUT NOKIA, BEST BUY, BLACKBERRY, AMC, ETC WallStreetBets is also investing heavily in Nokia, Best Buy, Blackberry, AMC Theaters, and other stocks. I am not a financial expert and don’t know what will happen with these but in the short term these stocks have also seen large gains (but smaller than GameStop). All of them have been shorted, but not shorted as heavily as GameStop. WHAT THIS ALL MEANS The financial press is trying to explain what this means for them, hedge funds, capitalism, the economy, and the stock market moving forward. Internet culture reporters are trying to explain if this is GOOD or BAD, if this is the Donald Trump-ification of the stock market, where a meme or troll gets out of control and causes unprecedented havoc on the real world. Anthony Scaramucci, of all people, is calling this the ""French Revolution of finance."" It is true that this means something and that this is likely a big moment. We are seeing, I think, the democratization of financial information, at least to some extent. While we've seen technology like deepfakes and facial recognition filter down from research firms and big companies into the hands of ordinary people and amateur technologists who then use them for whatever purposes they want, we are seeing financial technologies, information, and analysis becoming available not just to hedge fund managers, financial institutions, and the very rich, but to the masses. It is clear that there is a sect of WallStreetBets who either previously or currently work in the financial sector who are fed up with increasing inequality, are tired of watching giant corporations repeatedly fuck over ordinary people, and are explaining how it all works to huge groups of people. What they are doing is risky, but it's not ""very stupid."" We have been told for decades that the banks and the people who work at Goldman Sachs and Fidelity and hedge funds none of us have ever heard of are smarter than us, that they deserve to be rich, that they should be the ones who pull the levers on the economy, that they should decide which companies are good and which are bad, that they should be the ones who help make financial regulations. All along the way they have gotten fabulously wealthy and we have been stuck with stagnant wages, record consumer debt, and financial advice that tells us to wait until we are old to retire. WallStreetBets says this is a new paradigm where the masses have the power and hedge funds are scared. A top post on the subreddit this morning was called this: ""FOR ALL THE BIG FUCKING HEDGE FUNDS MONITORING US, THIS IS A MESSAGE FROM US TO YOU, WE FUCKING OWN YOU NOW, FUCK. YOU."" It's unclear how far this will go. After all, people with thousands of dollars to invest in GameStop still have thousands of dollars to invest with, unlike the millions of people in the U.S. currently out of work due to a deadly pandemic. The free investment app of choice, Robinhood, was also just fined by the SEC for hosing its own customers by seeking favorable rebates instead of the best prices for its users. And even if some hedge funds are getting bodied by retail investors, the massive funds such as Fidelity and Blackrock that own tens of millions of GameStop shares are probably just as happy.",Boko Haram leader Shekau says he's ready to surrender-Military — Daily Times Nigeria,other,
752b2869,"The Justice Department's investigation into Russian election meddling and any ties to the Trump campaign has cost more than $25 million since it started in the spring of 2017, according to Justice Department documents released Friday. Special counsel Robert Mueller's office spent nearly $4.6 million to operate from April through the end of September, on top of $3.9 million in costs incurred by the DOJ and FBI connected to Mueller's investigation. Previous documents the Justice Department released revealed costs of nearly $17 million related to the probe from May 2017 through March 2018. That $4.6 million figure includes roughly $2.9 million spent on compensation and benefits, $580,000 on travel and transportation, and $943,000 spent on rent, communications and utilities. Mueller's investigation has resulted in a slew of indictments and convictions. Among those convicted is former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Former Trump attorney Michael Cohen has also pleaded guilty to charges including lying to Congress and campaign finance violations. On Wednesday, he was sentenced to three years in prison.

1a0fed37,"Last week, in the days leading up to Sanders’ withdrawal and after, the two spoke several times — including Wednesday, when the Vermont senator formally suspended his campaign. Sanders and Biden’s teams have also been in regular communication, with Sanders’ campaign manager Faiz Shakir and senior adviser Jeff Weaver speaking with Biden’s top two advisers, Anita Dunn and Ron Klain. Sanders’ endorsement was no mere formality. Though the Vermont senator formally suspended his campaign last week, Sanders did not say he endorsed Biden, nor did he call on his dedicated followers to vote for his former opponent. Sanders also pledged to hang on to his delegates, which caused some Democrats to fear the primary could wind up repeating the mistakes of 2016, when acrimony marked the relationship between Sanders and Hillary Clinton in 2016. Many Democrats believe that bitter divide played a role in her loss to Trump in November. That rancor between Clinton and Sanders surfaced again this year when the former senator and secretary of state made headlines during the primary for saying “nobody” likes Sanders. But Biden did. He always made sure to be friendly and respectful with Sanders, who repaid the favor — sometimes too much, Sanders advisers fretted when he refused to bludgeon Biden on the debate stage. Even in 2016, Sanders aides note, Biden made sure to praise Sanders when he was anathema to the rest of the Democratic establishment. ""Bernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real. And he has credibility on it. And that is the absolutely enormous concentration of wealth in a small group of people with the middle class being left out,” said Biden in January 2016. ""It's relatively new for Hillary to talk about that.” Biden repeated those words about Bernie’s credibility as he lavished praise on his former rival Monday. Sanders’ endorsement gave Biden a chance to break into the news cycle with a headline-grabbing announcement, a rarity in recent weeks as he, along with Sanders, remains stuck at home during the pandemic as reports about the contagion and the president’s response to it suck up all the media oxygen.",Bernie makes it official: It’s Biden or bust,other,
104f03d3,"Contractors bidding for work with the government are being asked to affirm that they back Brexit. Liam Fox’s Department for International Trade DIT has inserted a clause into advertisements inviting tech companies to bid for work, saying that in order to have the right “cultural fit” for the task, they must “be committed to the best possible outcome for the United Kingdom following its departure from the European Union”. Pro-Brexit ministers have sometimes been frustrated by civil servants’ lack of enthusiasm for the complex task of unpicking Britain’s close relationship with the EU and appear to be determined to hire firms that share their optimism. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary and prominent leave campaigner, used a speech to the British Chambers of Commerce on Tuesday to condemn “droning and moaning” about the risks of leaving the EU. Last December, contractor Deloitte apologised after details of a damning report it had written about Downing Street’s plans for handling the article 50 process were leaked. The company also agreed to pull out of bidding for government contracts for six months. The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, said: “The Conservative Brexit government demanding there must be a ‘cultural fit’ is straight out of the pages of Nineteen Eighty-Four. “The private opinions of government employees have always been their own business. Now they are required to support Brexit, will they have to support the Tories too?” Farron added: “Professionals will always strive for the best outcomes in their work without being told how they should and shouldn’t think.” The ‘cultural fit’ requirement in two advertisements for short-term digital contracts. Photograph: Gov.uk The “cultural fit” requirement appears in two government advertisements for short-term digital contracts. One invites bids from firms to “investigate the feasibility of designing a system to manage intelligence on market access barriers”; another is for “investigating the feasibility of creating certain services around trade remedies as trade legislation is transferred from the EU to the UK”. As Theresa May prepares to trigger article 50, the two new government departments she set up to oversee the process – DIT and the Department for Exiting the European Union – are both hiring staff and contractors. The requirement to back the best deal for Britain is one of a list of criteria applicants for the two DIT contracts are asked to fulfil, alongside being “focused enough to stick to the task at hand”, “committed and hard-working” and “enthused by the prospect of working at the frontline in such an exciting and dynamic area”. In total, these “cultural fit” criteria will be given a 15% weighting in assessing which company to pick, the ads say. Academics and former senior civil servants have repeatedly warned about the complexity of the task facing politicians in extricating Britain from the EU, with one thinktank, UK in a Changing Europe, warning recently that it could overwhelm the capacities of the state; but these sceptics have often been accused of trying to “block Brexit”. Fox cannot yet draw up new trade deals because the UK will continue to trade under existing arrangements while it remains a member of the EU. But he has been travelling the world in a process his advisers call “pitch-rolling” for new deals that can be signed as soon as possible after Brexit. Article 50 kicks off a two-year process of negotiations with the other 27 EU member states. May has repeatedly said she intends to invoke it before the end of March. A DIT spokesperson said: “Ongoing recruitment is enabling us to build a team from the widest pool of talent in the civil service and externally, across a range of policy and corporate expertise and international experience. “The contract advertised is for a team to design a system to manage intelligence on market access barriers. “They will be required to act with objectivity and impartiality under the civil service code.”",Firms bidding for government contracts asked if they back Brexit,other,

7be6b208,"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Monday that former Vice President Joe Biden is ""considering"" forgiving $50,000 in federal student loan debt for every borrower with an annual salary of under $125,000 — a move that would place an incredibly heavy burden on taxpayers. More than 40 million Americans currently have outstanding federal loans, amounting to a whopping total of $1.54 trillion in debt. What did he say? ""We have come to the conclusion that President Biden can undo this debt, can forgive $50,000 of debt the first day he becomes president,"" Schumer announced to supporters outside of his New York office. ""You don't need Congress; all you need is the flick of a pen. ""I have told him how important it is. He is considering it,"" Schumer added after a reporter asked if he had spoken to Biden about the proposal. ""We believe he does [have the executive authority], and he's researching that. I believe that when he does his research, he will find that he does."" During the 2020 Democratic primary, Biden expressed support for a Democratic legislative proposal that would immediately cancel up to $10,000 in debt for each borrower. But since then, progressives in the party have been urging the former vice president to bypass Congress and cancel the debt by executive fiat. Whether it is constitutional for a president to take such an action remains in question. What else? Later during the event, a reporter pressed Schumer on the equity of debt cancelation. ""What about the families that have made sacrifices to pay off the student loans for their students? What about the students who have paid off their student loans?"" the reporter asked. ""Look,"" Schumer responded, ""lots of students paid off student loans, but it's such a burden it's good for everybody to make sure this debt is vanquished."" After the event had concluded, one of individuals standing next to Schumer, mocked the reporter's question, brushing it off as just the ""Fox News perspective"" on the issue. ""These people have great futures, but they are burdened by debt ... we want to remove it,"" Schumer had plainly stated during the event. Yet, despite Schumer's portrayal of debt cancelation as an obvious, kind solution, in reality, it is far from either. As TheBlaze previously reported, contrary to what progressive politicians claim, ""'canceling debt' is not something that actually exists. Lawmakers could remove a borrower's liability for re-paying the debt, but the debt will be shifted onto someone"" and ""in the case of federal student loans, the burden would be further shifted onto taxpayers.""","Scottish Parliament should return to business, say Tories",other,
e8875ff6,"A Utah-based left-wing activist is facing criminal charges for allegedly participating in the Capitol Hill riot last week. John Sullivan, who is the founder of Insurgence USA — a social justice group he started after the death of George Floyd — was arrested and charged in federal court in Washington, DC, according to a report by Salt Lake Tribune. An affidavit in support of a criminal complaint and arrest warrant alleges Sullivan “knowingly and willfully joined a crowd of individuals who forcibly entered the U.S. Capitol and impeded, disrupted, and disturbed the orderly conduct of business” by the U.S. House and Senate. While Sullivan claims he attended last week’s “Stop the Steal” march as a journalist, the affidavit signed by FBI Special Agent Matthew Foulger says otherwise. The criminal complaint reads: At various times, Sullivan has claimed to be a journalist. He has admitted, however, that he has no press credentials and the investigation has not revealed any connection between Sullivan and any journalistic organizations. In the affidavit, Foulger goes on to detail videos — that Sullivan provided to the FBI — in which the left-wing activist can allegedly be heard encouraging protesters inside and around the Capitol Building. In one video, Sullivan can be heard — as he approaches the Capitol Building with others — saying, “There are so many people. Let’s go. This shit is ours! Fuck yeah,” “We accomplished this shit. We did this together. Fuck yeah! We are all a part of this history,” and “Let’s burn this shit down.” The affidavit adds that while walking through the Capitol, Sullivan can also be heard saying, “it’s our house motherfuckers,” and “we are getting this shit.” “In at least two encounters, Sullivan can be heard on the video arguing with the officers, telling them to stand down so that they do not get hurt,” reads the criminal complaint. “At one point in the video, Sullivan enters an office within the U.S. Capitol — once inside the office, Sullivan approaches a window — and states, ‘We did this shit. We took this shit.'” the affidavit adds. The criminal complaint goes on to say that at one point, “a knocking noise is heard off-screen. The camera then pans to show more of the window and a broken pane can be seen that was not broken on Sullivan’s approach to the window.” “Sullivan can then be heard saying, ‘I broke it. My bad, my apologies. Well they already broke a window, so, you know, I didn’t know I hit it that hard. No one got that on camera,'” the affidavit continues. “Eventually, individuals in the crowd outside the doors announce that the officers are leaving and ‘giving us the building,'” the affidavit adds. “As the crowd begins to part so the officers can leave, Sullivan can be heard saying, ‘Haul that motherfucker out this bitch.'” At another point in the video, Sullivan is walking down a hallway inside the Capitol Building with a large group of people, and can be heard saying, “Why don’t we go in there” as he pans the camera to a closed door. Then, after someone hits the door, Sullivan can be heard saying, “That’s what I’m sayin’, break that shit.” The affidavit goes on to detail several other examples of Sullivan’s conduct on Capitol Hill that day, adding the activist had also posted some of the videos to social media, under the pseudonym JaydenX. The criminal complaint also notes Sullivan was charged with “Rioting and Criminal Mischief” over the summer by local law enforcement authorities in Provo, Utah. The arrest was in connection with a June protest in which one person was shot and injured. The case is still pending. For his actions on January 6, the left-wing activist faces federal charges of civil disorder, entering a restricted building or grounds, and violent entry or disorderly conduct.",Foreign Ministry comments on US anti-Russian sanctions over Skripal case,other,

To receive food call the helpline on 0800 587 4695 or email Covid19@belfastcity.gov.uk • FactcheckNI have queried this article, see below The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the food security of 25% of the population was determined in research from the charity Feeding Britain and Northumbria University’s Healthy Living Lab. The research, which included people in NI, also found that one in four adults who look after children have eaten less so they can feed the children in their household. Sign up to our daily newsletter The i newsletter cut through the noise Sign up Thanks for signing up! Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later. Submitting... Researchers found that half of all adults have tried to cope during the pandemic by purchasing less expensive food which they would not ordinarily choose to buy. Nearly one in three adults who are the least ‘food secure’, and who are looking after children, have also resorted more frequently to eating less so that their children can eat. Kevin Higgins of Advice NI said: “I certainly see these figures as valid for Northern Ireland and this justifies the Covid measures put in place to support people during lockdown.” His organisation, which gives benefits advice, has given extensive support to the vulnerable under lockdown, he said; their NI Covid-19 Community Helpline (0808-802-0020) has answered 18,000 calls since March 27, of which 69% were food related. Mr Higgins also said that some 150,000 food boxes have been distributed across NI under lockdown and that Universal Credit claims in NI have risen from 70,000 to 134,000. “Moving forward I think there needs to be a review of the social security system to ensure it is fit for purpose and provides an adequate income,” he added. Recent improvements to Universal Credit need to be maintained beyond the Covid crisis, he said, and the independent advice sector must be supported to assist people as we emerge from lockdown. Prof Greta Defeyter, director of Northumbria University’s Healthy Living Lab, said: “These findings present an appalling picture of the high percentage of adults experiencing food insecurity in the UK. “If we, as a country, are to stand a chance of getting to grips with this problem, we need the prime minister to oversee and implement with urgency a national food strategy which enhances the supply, affordability, and accessibility of nutritious food to everyone in our country.” This must minimise the need to deploy the many coping strategies, such as the use of food banks, which were identified through the survey, she added. Andrew Forsey, director of Feeding Britain, said: “This survey reveals the lengths to which millions of people in our country are going to keep themselves and their families fed during the pandemic.” The charity is recommending the creation of a jobs programme to prevent long-term unemployment and a review of deductions from Universal Credit and the suspension of the related two-child limit. It is also calling for year-round ‘seamless’ school lunches and breakfasts for children, and tougher employment protections for people in low-paid and precarious work. • FactcheckNI response to this article: Article which claimed that one person in four in Northern Ireland is at risk of hunger was unsubstantiated A message from the Editor: Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Alistair Bushe","Adam Castillejo is still free of the virus more than 30 months after stopping anti-retroviral therapy. He was not cured by the HIV drugs, however, but by a stem-cell treatment he received for a cancer he also had, the Lancet HIV journal reports. The donors of those stem cells have an uncommon gene that gives them, and now Mr Castillejo, protection against HIV. In 2011, Timothy Brown, the ""Berlin Patient"" became the first person reported as cured of HIV, three and half years after having similar treatment. Stem-cell transplants appear to stop the virus being able to replicate inside the body by replacing the patient's own immune cells with donor ones that resist HIV infection. Adam Castillejo - the now 40-year-old ""London Patient"" who has decided to go public with his identity - has no detectable active HIV infection in his blood, semen or tissues, his doctors say. It is now a year after they first announced he was clear of the virus and he still remains free of HIV. Lead researcher Prof Ravindra Kumar Gupta, from the University of Cambridge, told BBC News: ""This represents HIV cure with almost certainty. ""We have now had two and a half years with anti-retroviral-free remission. ""Our findings show that the success of stem-cell transplantation as a cure for HIV, first reported nine years ago in the Berlin Patient, can be replicated."" But it will not be a treatment for the millions of people around the world living with HIV. The aggressive therapy was primarily used to treat the patients' cancers, not their HIV. And current HIV drugs remain very effective, meaning people with the virus can live long and healthy lives. Prof Gupta said: ""It is important to note that this curative treatment is high-risk and only used as a last resort for patients with HIV who also have life-threatening haematological malignancies. ""Therefore, this is not a treatment that would be offered widely to patients with HIV who are on successful anti-retroviral treatment."" But it might offer hope of finding a cure, in the future, using gene therapy. How does it work? CCR5 is the most commonly used receptor by HIV-1 - the virus strain of HIV that dominates around the world - to enter cells. But a very small number of people who are resistant to HIV have two mutated copies of the CCR5 receptor. This means the virus cannot penetrate cells in the body it normally infects. Researchers say it may be possible to use gene therapy to target the CCR5 receptor in people with HIV. It is the same receptor the now jailed Chinese scientist He Jiankui worked on when he created the world's first gene-edited babies. Is it a permanent cure? The tests suggest 99% of Mr Castillejo's immune cells have been replaced by donor ones. But he still has remnants of the virus in his body, as does Mr Brown. And it is impossible to say with absolute certainty his HIV will never come back. Mr Castillejo told the New York Times: ""This is a unique position to be in, a unique and very humbling position. ""I want to be an ambassador of hope. ""I don't want people to think, 'Oh, you've been chosen.' ""No, it just happened. ""I was in the right place, probably at the right time, when it happened."" Prof Sharon Lewin, from the University of Melbourne, Australia, said: ""Given the large number of cells sampled here and the absence of any intact virus, is the London Patient truly cured? ""The additional data provided in this follow-up case report is certainly encouraging but unfortunately, in the end, only time will tell.""",other,

How? Because agricultural productivity would go up. Several thousand ppm in greenhouses Happer: “if you look around the world, many greenhouse operators put several thousand parts per million into their greenhouses. Host: “Would there be any negative effects on humans from breathing a trhousand parts per million? Happer: “No, absolutely not.” Our primate ancestors were here roughly 70 to 80 million years ago when CO2 levels were 3,000 parts per million. That’s when we evolved. “So it was ten times what it is now.” Happer: “We also let our sailors in submarines live in atmospheres that are several thousand parts per million.” Glacier Bay glaciers disappeared long before any increase in CO2 Happer (6:20 in): “The glaciers in Alaska’s Glacier Bay are all gone. They disappeared in the 1800s.” Happer: “In fact, that was one of the most famous trips of John Muir. Muir, the founder of the Sierra Club, was visiting Glacier Bay in 1879, and he pointed out all the glaciers were gone.

073f3552,"EXCLUSIVE: Third of cases won by terrorists, murderers and lags EXCLUSIVE by TOM NEWTON DUNN, Political Editor 17th August 2015, 11:01 pm Updated: 5th April 2016, 8:00 pm A THIRD of those who have won against Britain at the European Court of Human Rights are terrorists, prisoners or criminals, figures show. Among claimants the court found in favour of since 1975 are murderers, terrorists in Iraq and IRA gunmen. Its recent controversial judgments include refusing a Home Office deportation order for Islamic hate preacher Abu Qatada and insisting prisoners must have the vote. The figures showing that the 297 victories against the UK included 94 prisoners, terrorists or criminals are revealed in a glossy dossier produced by ECHR-supporting pressure group RightsInfo. It is a response to criticisms of the Strasbourg court by Tory ministers and The Sun. Commons Justice Committee chairman Bob Neill MP said: “This is well beyond what any sensible person would say is real human rights. “It’s mission creep, law made by judges who are not judges and many from countries with questionable human rights and very little judicial experience. “Political pressure groups take advantage of that naivety, which costs the British taxpayer considerable sums.” It costs £286million a year to fund the euro judges’ governing body, the Council of Europe and £23million of that comes from British taxes. Since 1959, the UK has won only 41 per cent of 513 ECHR cases. RightsInfo’s Adam Wagner said: “People accused of crimes or convicted of offences have human rights too, so it isn’t surprising that they have featured in 40 years of cases.” The fanatic Hate preacher Abu Qatada Reuters 3 ABU Qatada won the right to stay in Britain rather than be deported to his homeland Jordan after ECHR judges said there was a risk evidence obtained by torture could be used against him in a terror trial. In that case Qatada, described as Osama Bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe, would not get a fair trial. The Strasbourg court’s 2012 decision overturned a ruling by UK law lords. Qatada had been convicted in Jordan in 1999 in his absence of a conspiracy to carry out bombings. He was finally returned in 2013 after Jordan agreed torture evidence would not be used. PRISONER John Hirst first won the right for convicted criminals to vote following a European court ruling in 2005. Hirst had previously lost his claim at the High Court in 2001 but took the case to Europe and won. No UK Government has legislated on the issue despite four rulings in Hirst’s favour by the Strasbourg-based court. Hirst who served 25 years for the unprovoked manslaughter of his landlady, said: “You don’t lose your status in civil society just because you’re in prison — you are still a member of the public.” The IRA men Ulster Unionist MP Ken Maginnis 3 TEN IRA men killed by soldiers and the Royal Ulster Constabulary had their human rights violated, the ECHR ruled in 2001. Its judges said the authorities failed to conduct proper inquiries into the deaths. The UK Government was ordered to pay each of the IRA men’s families £10,000. Tory and Ulster Unionist MPs said the ruling was a disgrace and an insult to those who tried to keep the peace. Unionist Ken Maginnis said: “It now seems common practice as far as the European Courts are concerned to pander to militant Irish republicanism.”",European Court of Killers’ Rights,other,
3a0ddacc,"Last year was warmer by 0.04 Celsius, but it was also an El Niño year. By now you’ve seen the headline: 2016 was the hottest year on record. The news has been paired with predictions of civilization’s imminent demise. But a closer look at the evidence reveals that the political heat is overwrought—and there’s still no reason to re-engineer the global economy to mitigate small climate fluctuations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced this week that last year was the warmest in the agency’s 137-year series, and that 2016 broke the previous record for the third consecutive year. This sounds alarming, until you read that 2016 edged out 2015 by a mere 0.04 degrees Celsius. That’s a fraction of the margin of error. Atmospheric data from satellites detected similarly small warming over previous years. In other words, no one really knows if last year was a record. Here’s what we do know: 2015 and 2016 were major years for El Niño, a Pacific trade winds phenomenon known to produce temperature spikes. The Cato Institute’s Patrick Michaels has detailed in these pages how in 1998, another big El Niño year, average surface temperatures increased about a quarter-degree Fahrenheit and then dropped in the following years. That is similar to the increase in 2015—and by the end of 2016 temperatures were falling back toward 2014 levels. Even NOAA admits El Niño’s role. The underreported news here is that the warming is not nearly as great as the climate-change computer models have predicted. As climatologist Judith Curry testified to Congress in 2014, U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change simulations forecast surface temperatures to increase on average 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade in the early 21st century. The warming over the first 15 years was closer to 0.05 degrees Celsius. The models also can’t explain why more than 40% of the temperature increase since 1900 happened between 1910 and 1945, which accounts for only 10% of the increase in carbon emissions. These nuances are important because phrases such as “hottest year ever” are waved around as a pretext for political action that usually involves giving more control over the economy to governments. This is inevitably sold as urgently required to save the planet.",Keeping Cool About Hot Temperatures,other,

9f89b2ba,"The nosediving security situation in the country is increasingly putting President Muhammadu Buhari under pressure as prominent Nigerians, among whom are governors, former political office holders, clerics and Nobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, have started to speak out in condemnation of his alleged inaction. The past two weeks have particularly been traumatic for the country, with killings, abductions and attacks on communities and security agencies, especially as killing of police officers continues unabated. Within the period, bandits operating in Kaduna State invaded a private institution in the State, Greenfield University in Chikun Local Government Area, abducted more than 20 students and killed a staff during the attack. In a gruesome move, the bandits, who asked for N800 million ransom, have killed five of the students to show that they meant business. During the period also, scores of innocent Nigerians were killed in Zamfara State as Boko Haram attempted to take over Geidam in Yobe State and Mainok in Borno State, with the Nigerian military fighting desperately to retake them, albeit at a cost, as some men and officers were lost during the battle. Not done, bandits also attacked and abducted students of the Federal University of Agriculture, Markurdi, the Benue State capital, early in the week. Nothing has been heard about the fate of the students. This is apart from a revelation from the Governor of the State, Samuel Ortom that about 70 residents of the state have been killed in two weeks. The situation in Niger State is fast becoming hopeless, as two LGAs, Munya and Shiroro, have practically become bandits’ killing fields. This was before a shocking revelation by the state governor, Abubakar Sani Bello that Boko Haram insurgents have infiltrated the state, hoisting their flag in Kaure in Munya LGA, an indication that they have declared a caliphate in the area. Also down South, the situation in the South-East geopolitical zone is increasing calling for concerns, as no day passes without reports of attacks on the police formations and personnel. What makes the South-East situation more alarming is that the operation of ‘gunmen’ in the zone have mainly focused on security agents, in what reminds Nigerians about the formative days of the Boko Haram insurgency. This has no doubt raised comcerns in several circles of an evolving insurgency in Igboland, a situation many believe Nigeria may not be able to cope with, especially with the current insurgency in North-East and banditry in the North-West and North Central. Realising that the security situation in the country was practically spiralling out of control, prominent Nigerians decided to speak out, putting further pressure on the Buhari administration, which many Nigerians said has proven unable to proffer solution to the hydra headed security challenges in the country. In a rather frustrated outburst, Nasir el-Rufai, Governor of Kaduna State, who has constantly shown his disgust for the bandits operating in his state, pointedly declared that what the bandits and other criminal elements terrorising the country deserve is deaths. He said, “kill them all”. According to him, no one staying in the forests is innocent and what they deserve is death, opening a floodgate of intervention, angry outbursts and advice from prominent Nigerians. Respected Nobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, shortly after the killing of three of the abducted students of Greenfield University, pointedly told President Buhari to swallow his pride and seek for help! “Seek Help. Stop Improvising with Human Lives. Youth – that is, the future – should not serve as ritual offering on the altar of a failing State”, he said in a statement on Saturday. According to Soyinka, Nigeria is at war but the government continues to pretend that “these are mere birth-pangs of a glorious entity”. He however, said the current situation in the country suggests death throes, adding, “Vultures and undertakers hover patiently but with full confidence.” “The dogs of war stopped merely baying years ago. Again and again, they have sunk their fangs into the jugular of this nation. The plague called COVID has met its match on the earth of some nation space once known as Nigeria”, Soyinka painted a scary picture of the Nigerian situation. The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), perhaps to show that it is a party with a soul, admitted, albeit for the first time that insecurity is real in the country. Before admitting what other Nigerians have always known in a statement by its National Secretary, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, the APC had always beaten its chest that the Buhari administration has improved security in the country tremendously since coming into office in 2015. They also claimed that the security situation in the country had improved from what it used to be under the Goodluck Jonathan administration that ended on May 29, 2015. However, the party said: “The issue of insecurity in the country has found expression in terrorist and criminal activities of Boko Haram, bandits, kidnappers, rustlers and recently the highly condemnable attacks on security formations in some states. “These are current realities and the APC will not playing politics with matters of life and our collective wellbeing as a nation.” For many Nigerians, the admittance by the ruling party that all is not well with the country, may after all spur the government of the nation into action. This is because of the belief that the party and the country has always lived in denial of the actual situation in the country. Majority of Nigerians who watched the viral video of Niger State Governor, Abubakar Sani Bello talking about the situation in his state cut a pitiable sight of a man who is frustrated, not just for his inability to secure his people but also knowing that a greater evil, Boko Haram has taken residence right in his backyard. The Governor, in the video, while he went visiting about 3000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) taking refugee at a school in Minna, the state capital, said that Boko Haram insurgents are already in the state. He said: “I am confirming that there are Boko Haram elements in Niger State, around Kaure. “I just heard that they’ve already hoisted their flag in Kaure, which means they’ve taken over the territory and this is what I have been engaging the FG with, and unfortunately it has now gotten to this stage that if care is not taken, not even Abuja is safe. “They’ve taken over the territory, they’ve installed their flag. I am confirming that now. They’ve taken over the wives of people by force. “Boko Haram elements are trying to use these areas as their home just like they did in Sambisa.” In what seems like a double speak, Governor Bello said: “I have not lost hope from the federal government but I am not waiting for anyone anymore.” DAILY POST recalls that Niger State has had history with the Boko Haram insurgency, as the state was at a time used as a launching pad for attempted incursions into Abuja in the hey days of the group. Joining his voice to calls by the Buhari administration to seek for help in tackling the declining security situation in the country, the Immediate-past Senate President, Bukola Saraki, on Tuesday, said the President needs help and he must seek for one. Saraki, who said it was obvious that Buhari was already overwhelmed, said the situation “cannot continue” and “cannot become Nigeria’s new normal”. He said: “It is obvious that President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress government need help. They have been overwhelmed by the situation and they sure need assistance from all. Thus, I urge Mr. President to seek help wherever it can be given. This matter has gone beyond what the government can handle alone. The President should know that calling for help in our present situation is not a sign of weakness.” According to Saraki, President Buhari needs to bring together all former Presidents and heads of state, serving and former chief justices, serving and former presiding officers of the National Assembly, serving and former heads of security agencies, traditional rulers with relevant experience, leaders of the private sector, development partners, friends of Nigeria in the international community and all others who can help in finding solutions to the problem at hand. “The meeting must hold expeditiously and must be followed by immediate actions. I know there are many people who believe that the fact that this suggestion is coming from a source outside government is a good reason for the President to ignore it. I think the attitude this time around must be different. This is definitely not a time for partisanship or for people to play politics with the lives of the citizenry and the future of the country. “I appeal to Mr. President to take the bull by the horn. He should act to stem the tide of this violence threatening to tear the country apart,” he added. Following in the footsteps of Saraki, his former deputy at the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, also on Tuesday, called on the Federal Government to seek foreign help to fight insecurity in the country. Ekweremadu made the call while contributing to a motion moved during plenary by Senator Sani Musa on the activities of bandits and Boko Haram terrorists in Shiroro and Rafi Local Government Areas of Niger State. According to Senator Ekweremadu, any government that fails to protect its citizens has lost its legitimacy, therefore, the Federal Government should not be ashamed to seek foreign support, while also calling for a shutdown of Niger to enable security agencies to deal with the problem. On his part, a former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar warned that there is looming darkness over the country, if the attacks on schools and abduction of students continue. Calling for a 24-hour arms guard in schools, Atiku opined that if the current situation persists, school enrollment will further decline. He said in a statement: “The abduction of yet an unspecific number of undergraduates of the Federal University of Agriculture, Makurdi, Benue State, is one abduction too many. It marks both an unacceptable escalation and an expansion of this menace, and we must not only ensure that the abducted youths are rescued, but even more importantly, we must put in measures to prevent future reoccurrences. “This must not be allowed to become our new normal. It is time for us as a nation to face the reality that we have an emergency on our hands. A catastrophe that must be decisively dealt with before it snowballs into an existential crisis. “We must stop treating these acts of criminality with kid gloves. Enough is enough! There must be safety of lives and property in our citadels of learning, because without it, there would be loss of confidence in the sector, which will result in low enrolment rates in a country that is amongst the highest statistically for out-of-school children. “I renew the call I made on Monday, March 15, 2021, for a state of emergency to be declared on the education sector, and for 24 hour armed guards to be posted at all schools in the affected states. “Yes, it is an expensive venture. Nevertheless, we must accept that whatever we invest in preserving the lives of Nigerian youths is worth the price, as nothing is, or can be more valuable to us than our youths, who will take up the baton after we are gone.” To put the icing on the cake, the usually blunt Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, on Tuesday accused President Muhammadu Buhari of working for Fulanis to take over Nigeria. The Governor said: “What is happening now, to me, is very clear; Mr President is just working for these Fulanis to take over the whole country. “His body language is what is being played out. The body language, the action and inaction of Mr President shows that he is only the President of Fulani people; I have known this. “We are becoming a Banana Republic. If we have a President who gave the security agencies order to shoot at sight whosoever is having AK-47 and the Minister of Defence came out to say that they cannot shoot at sight. So who is the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces?” According to Ortom, the people of Benue are being overstretched and running out of patience due to the incessant attacks on their communities. “Mr President must rise up. He is the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and over the 250 nationalities that are in this country; Mr President is their President, we all voted him. “He has taken oath of office to secure the country and provide security for lives and property; this is unacceptable, this cannot continue,” he said.",No help to buy – the flagship government policy that's just misleading,other,

9888a504,"In January, freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) claimed the world ""is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change."" But according to new data from NASA, one of the previously fastest shrinking glaciers in the world is growing again, calling into question the narrative that rapid climate change — i.e., global warming — poses a significant threat to the existence of the human race, let alone the entire planet. What are the details? For the last 20 years, the Jakobshavn Glacier in Greenland was one of the fastest shrinking ice sheets in the world, losing on average 1.8 miles of ice annually while thinning 130 feet per year, according to The Associated Press. But in 2016 something changed: The glacier began growing again, at about the same rate it was previously retreating, researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said in a newly published Nature Geoscience journal article. ""At first we didn't believe it. We had pretty much assumed that Jakobshavn would just keep going on as it had over the last 20 years,"" Ala Khazendar, the study's lead author, said, according to USA Today. More from the AP: A natural cyclical cooling of North Atlantic waters likely caused the glacier to reverse course, said study lead author Ala Khazendar, a NASA glaciologist on the Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) project. Khazendar and colleagues say this coincides with a flip of the North Atlantic Oscillation — a natural and temporary cooling and warming of parts of the ocean that is like a distant cousin to El Nino in the Pacific. The water in Disko Bay, where Jakobshavn hits the ocean, is about 3.6 degrees cooler than a few years ago, study authors said. In fact, the study said the waters in the region have cooled to temperatures not seen in more than 30 years. What does this mean for the future? While the development seems positive on the surface, it could spell bad news for the overall direction of the climate. NASA climate scientist Josh Willis, who participated in the study, noted that while the glacier's growth is positive, the study proves that glaciers are more sensitive to ocean temperature changes than previously thought, which could mean disaster in the future if the oceans experience sudden warming. ""All this is an indicator of how sensitive glaciers are to ocean temperatures,"" Khazendar explained to National Geographic. Meanwhile, University of Washington ice scientist Ian Joughin compared NASA's latest findings to that of the stock market. ""[The glacier's growth is] to a large extent, a temporary blip. Downturns do occur in the stock market, but overall the long-term trajectory is up.

964e13e1,"Iran Parliamentarians have moved a bill in order to protect the rights of children which includes a clause that lets a man marry his own adopted daughter considering the fact that she is 13 years old. However, activists of the country have expressed alarm that the bill sanctioned by parliament, gives an opportunity for the caretaker of a family to marry his or her adopted child if a court orders it is in the best interests of the individual child. Credits: Care2.com Iran’s Guardian Council, a body of clerics and jurists which reviews all parliamentary bills before the constitution and the Islamic law, has yet to give its final verdict on the controversial legislation. To the shock of rights campaigners, girls in the Islamic republic can marry as young as 13 years old if they seek permission from their father. On the other hand, boys can marry only after the age of 15. In Iran, a girl under the age of 13 can still marry but needs a judge’s permission. As of now, however, marrying stepchildren is prohibited under any circumstances. 42,000 children aged between 10 and 14 got married in the year 2010, as per the Iranian news website Tabnak. At least 75 children under the age of 10 were married in Tehran alone. Shadi Sadr who is a human rights lawyer with the London-based group Justice for Iran, told the Guardian website that she feared the council would feel safe and secure to put its stamp of acceptance on the bill while Iran’s moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, grabs the attention of the press during his UN visit to New York. “This bill is legalising paedophilia,” she alerted. “It’s not part of the Iranian culture to marry your adopted child. Obviously, incest exists in Iran more or less as it happens in other countries across the world, but this bill is legalising paedophilia and is endangering our children and normalising this crime in our culture.” She added: “You should not be able to marry your adopted children, full stop. If a father marries his adopted daughter who is a minor and has sex, that’s rape.” As per Sadr, Iran officials tried to play down the sexual part of such marriages, adding that it is in the bill to fix the issue of hijab [head scarf] complications when a child is adopted. An adopted daughter is likely to wear the hijab in front of her dad, and a mother should wear it only in front of her adopted son if he is old enough, Sadr said. “With this bill, you can be a paedophile and get your bait in the pretext of adopting children,” Sadr said. Some experts reckon that the new bill is opposed to Islamic beliefs and would not pass the Guardian Council. However, an initial draft of the bill, which totally banned marriage with adopted children, was not sanctioned by the council and it is feared that MPs introduced the condition for marriage only to satisfy the jurists and clergymen. This is the reason why Sadr fears it can pass the council this time. The bill drew huge backlash in Iran with the reformist newspaper, Shargh, posting an article warning about its consequences. “How can someone be looking after you and at the same time be your husband?” the article asked. Shiva Dolatabadi who is the head of Iran’s society for protecting children’s rights gave a warning that the bill implies that the parliament is legalising incest. “You cannot open a way in which the role of a father or a mother can be mixed with that of a spouse,” she said, according to Shargh. “Children can’t be safe in such a family.” Though the bill was passed in 2013 as per media report, the news is getting unnecessary attention on social media in 2019.

cd9cd5e8,"MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin oversaw a test Wednesday of a new hypersonic glide vehicle, declaring that the weapon is impossible to intercept and will ensure Russia’s security for decades to come. Speaking to Russia’s top military brass after watching the live feed of the launch of the Avangard vehicle from the Defense Ministry’s control room, Putin said the successful test was a “great success” and an “excellent New Year’s gift to the nation.” The test comes amid bitter tensions in Russia-U.S. relations, which have sunk to their lowest level since the Cold War times over the conflict in Ukraine, the war in Syria and the allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Putin's hopes for repairing ties with Washington under President Donald Trump have fizzled amid investigations into allegations of Trump's campaign ties with Russia, and tensions have escalated as the U.S. administration slapped Russia with new waves of sanctions. The Avangard was among the array of new nuclear weapons that Putin presented in March, saying that Russia had to develop them in response to the development of the U.S. missile defense system that could erode Russia’s nuclear deterrent.

c79c81bd,"Chinese scientists believe the deadly coronavirus may have started life in a research facility just 300 yards from the Wuhan fish market. A new bombshell paper from the Beijing-sponsored South China University of Technology says that the Wuhan Center for Disease Control WHCDC could have spawned the contagion in Hubei province. 'The possible origins of 2019-nCoV coronavirus,' penned by scholars Botao Xiao and Lei Xiao claims the WHCDC kept disease-ridden animals in laboratories, including 605 bats. It also mentions that bats - which are linked to coronavirus - once attacked a researcher and 'blood of bat was on his skin.' Workers in protective gear carry a bag containing a giant salamander that was reported to have escaped from the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan in central China's Hubei Province in January The report says: 'Genome sequences from patients were 96% or 89% identical to the Bat CoV ZC45 coronavirus originally found in Rhinolophus affinis intermediate horseshoe bat.' It describes how the only native bats are found around 600 miles away from the Wuhan seafood market and that the probability of bats flying from Yunnan and Zhejiang provinces was minimal. In addition there is little to suggest the local populace eat the bats as evidenced by testimonies of 31 residents and 28 visitors. Instead the authors point to research being carried out withing a few hundred yards at the WHCDC. One of the researchers at the WHCDC described quarantining himself for two weeks after a bat's blood got on his skin, according to the report. That same man also quarantined himself after a bat urinated on him. 'The WHCDC was also adjacent to the Union Hospital Figure 1, bottom where the first group of doctors were infected during this epidemic.' The report says. And he also mentions discovering a live tick from a bat - parasites known for their ability to pass infections through a host animal's blood. 'The WHCDC was also adjacent to the Union Hospital Figure 1, bottom where the first group of doctors were infected during this epidemic.' The report says. 'It is plausible that the virus leaked around and some of them contaminated the initial patients in this epidemic, though solid proofs are needed in future study.' And as well as the WHCDC, the report suggests that the Wuhan Institute of Virology could also have leaked the virus, as has previously been reported by MailOnline. 'This laboratory reported that the Chinese horseshoe bats were natural reservoirs for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS-CoV which caused the 2002-3 pandemic,' the report says. members of staff of the Wuhan Hygiene Emergency Response Team drive their vehicle as they leave the closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city of Wuhan, in Hubei on January 11 The seafood market after it was locked off by police at the beginning of January 'The principle investigator participated in a project which generated a chimeric virus using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, and reported the potential for human emergence 10. A direct speculation was that SARS-CoV or its derivative might leak from the laboratory.' The report concludes that 'the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan.' It comes as the outbreak has infected more than 69,000 people globally, with 1,665 deaths in China - most of these in the central province of Hubei.","Woman forced to watch ‘Roots’ to ‘understand her racism,’ Cedar Rapids police say",other,
b84773e5,"Funding to help vulnerable children in England has been cut by nearly £2bn over the last five years, say charities. Early help by local authorities has been a casualty of government spending cuts, say the Children's Society and National Children's Bureau NCB. They say failure to intervene early means a greater cost to taxpayers later and will damage young lives. The government said it had increased early intervention funding. Early intervention funding - previously called the early intervention grant - enables local authorities to step in and help a child or young person who is vulnerable or at risk. The help includes advice on teenage pregnancy or drugs and alcohol, and help from children's centres and early years services. In a report - Cuts that cost: Trends in funding for early intervention services - research suggests that government funding for a range of early help services in England fell from £3.2bn in 2010 to £1.4bn in 2015. The charities say there are early indications, from a Freedom of Information request by the publication Children & Young People Now, that reductions in spending are set to continue for children's centres and services in 2015-16. A fund set up for the most vulnerable families in society, the Troubled Families programme, is expected to increase or remain stable. Preventing crises Experts in social work and child protection have suggested a potential link between the rise of child protection cases and the reduction in spending on early intervention services. Levels of demand on the child protection and care systems can provide some indication of the effectiveness of services that work to support families struggling to care for their children and prevent them reaching crisis point, says the report. Small child left aloneimage copyrightThinkstock image captionEarly intervention can turn around a child's life, says the report Matthew Reed, chief executive of the Children's Society, said: Early intervention and help for children of all ages improves their lives, stops damage, and prevents more costly remedial solutions in the subsequent few years. That's why we are calling on government to prioritise funding for early intervention and help for teenagers and children to make sure councils can maintain these essential services as we enter another period of austerity. If we keep cutting early help now it will cost us all dearly in the long run. A government spokesman said: Ensuring every child, regardless of their background, is given the opportunity to fulfil their potential is at the heart of this government's drive to provide real social justice. We have invested more than £2bn in early intervention services, including 15 hours of free childcare for the most disadvantaged two-year-olds and enough funding to retain a national network of children's centres, which are helping a record number of parents. We have given councils the freedom to use their funds on those services most needed by their communities. The £448m Troubled Families programme has turned around the lives of 117,000 of the most complex families, working with up to 400,000 more families from this year, backed with a further £200m investment.","Chris King Statement on 800 Percent Increase in Health Insurance Premiums for Low-Income Seniors Under Trumpcare  Orlando, Florida",other,
3963580,"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has yet again been caught exaggerating ‘global warming’ by fiddling with the raw temperature data. This time, that data concerns the recent record-breaking cold across the northeastern U.S. which NOAA is trying to erase from history. If you believe NOAA’s charts, there was nothing particularly unusual about this winter’s cold weather which caused sharks to freeze in the ocean and iguanas to drop out of trees. Here is NOAA’s January 2018 chart for Northeast U.S. – an area which includes New England along with NY, PA, NJ, DE and MD. You’d never guess from it that those regions had just experienced record-breaking cold, would you? That’s because, as Paul Homewood has discovered, NOAA has been cooking the books. Yet again – presumably for reasons more to do with ideology than meteorology – NOAA has adjusted past temperatures to look colder than they were and recent temperatures to look warmer than they were. We’re not talking fractions of a degree, here. The adjustments amount to a whopping 3.1 degrees F. This takes us well beyond the regions of error margins or innocent mistakes and deep into the realm of fiction and political propaganda. Homewood first smelt a rat when he examined the New York data sets. He was particularly puzzled at NOAA’s treatment of the especially cold winter that ravaged New York in 2013/14, which he describes here: The cold weather really began on Jan 2nd, when an Arctic front descended across much of the country, and extended well into March. The NWS wrote at the end of the winter: The winter of 2013-14 finished as one of the coldest winters in recent memory for New York State. Snowfall across Western and North Central New York was above normal for many areas, and in some locations well above normal. This winter comes on the heels of two previous mild winters, making the cold and snow this winter feel that much harsher. Temperatures this winter finished below normal every month, and the January through March timeframe finished at least 4 degrees below normal for the two primary climate stations of Western New York (Buffalo and Rochester)….. Relentless cold continued through the month of January across the region. So why, he wondered, did NOAA have this marked down as only the 30th coldest winter (since 1895) on its New York State charts, with a mean temperature of 16.9F? Homewood compared the local records for January 1943 and January 2014 – months which, according to NOAA’s charts, had very similar average temperatures. What he found was that NOAA’s charts were deeply inaccurate. The 2014 local temperatures had been adjusted upwards by NOAA and the 1943 local temperatures downwards. He concludes: On average the mean temperatures in Jan 2014 were 2.7F less than in 1943. Yet, according to NOAA, the difference was only 0.9F. Somehow, NOAA has adjusted past temperatures down, relatively, by 1.8F. Now, Homewood has given the same treatment to the most recent Big Freeze – the winter of 2017/2018. Yet again, he has found that NOAA’s arbitrary adjustments tell a lie. They claim that January 2018 was warmer in the New York region than January 1943, when the raw data from local stations tells us this just isn’t true. So at the three sites of Ithaca, Auburn and Geneva, we find that January 2018 was colder than January 1943 by 1.0, 1.7 and 1.3F respectively. Yet NOAA say that the division was 2.1F warmer last month. NOAA’s figure makes last month at least 3.1F warmer in comparison with 1943 than the actual station data warrants. He concludes: Clearly NOAA’s highly homogenised and adjusted version of the Central Lakes temperature record bears no resemblance at all the the actual station data. And if this one division is so badly in error, what confidence can there be that the rest of the US is any better? Well indeed. The key point here is that while NOAA frequently makes these adjustments to the raw data, it has never offered a convincing explanation as to why they are necessary. Nor yet, how exactly their adjusted data provides a more accurate version of the truth than the original data. One excuse NOAA’s apologists make is that weather stations are subject to changing environmental conditions. For example, when the station sited at Syracuse in 1929 was located at what was originally just a sparse aerodrome. Since then, however, as Homewood notes, it has grown into a large international airport with two runways servicing two million passengers a year. Its weather station readings therefore will certainly have been corrupted by the Urban Heat Island effect: that is, its temperature readings will have been artificially elevated by the warmth from the surrounding development and aircraft engines. So you’d think, wouldn’t you, that to compensate for this NOAA would adjust the recent temperatures downwards. Instead, for no obvious reasons, it has adjusted them upwards. This is a scandal. NOAA’s climate gatekeepers are political activists not honest scientists and the U.S. taxpayer has no business funding their propaganda.

A monthly analysis of forecasts prepared for Chancellor Philip Hammond showed that dozens of independent experts believe national output will continue growing this year. On average, they expect growth to continue at exactly the same rate as forecast before the EU referendum. Contrary to what economists and big banks like Goldman Sachs said, Brexit has heralded a new wave of growth as Britain prepares to unshackle itself from Brussels Craig Mackinlay The verdict was a major reversal following earlier expectations that the country’s decision to leave the EU would deliver a massive shock to the economy. Instead, the data suggests that the historic vote had no significant impact on growth at all. The u-turn was being seen last night as yet another devastating blow to the “Project Fear” scaremongering campaign run by the defeated and embittered supporters of Britain’s EU membership. GETTY Forecasts for Chancellor Philip Hammond showed that national output will continue growing this year GETTY Craig Mackinlay said in just three months 'Project Fear had descended to Project Farce' And it came amid growing expectations in the City that the Government is preparing for a “hard Brexit” that will mean quitting the EU single market and imposing full border controls. Tory MP Craig Mackinlay, who backed the Leave campaign, said: “In just three months Project Fear has descended into Project Farce. “Contrary to what economists and big banks like Goldman Sachs said, Brexit has heralded a new wave of growth as Britain prepares to unshackle itself from Brussels. “With new global free trade deals on the horizon the British economy has never looked so buoyant.” Brexit aftershocks: Who's next to leave the EU?

Miles Celic, the chief executive of financial services lobbying organisation TheCityUK, told a fringe meeting at the Labour Party conference in Liverpool that leaving the EU would open up British trade to the world.

c5a4ee2d,"If you needed any more proof that the migrant caravans at our Southern border are NOT what they appear to be, now these invaders are making a new demand. Now these “migrants” are saying “give us $50,000 each to return home, or else we’ll bust down your border,” as Fox News reports: Two groups of Central American migrants marched to the U.S. Consulate in Tijuana on Tuesday with a list of demands, with one group delivering an ultimatum to the Trump administration: either let them in the U.S. or pay them $50,000 each to go home, a report said. Among other demands were that deportations be halted and that asylum seekers be processed faster and in greater numbers, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. The first group of caravan members, that included about 100 migrants, arrived at the consulate around 11 a.m. Alfonso Guerreo Ulloa, an organizer from Honduras, said the $50,000 figure was chosen as a group. “It may seem like a lot of money to you,” Ulloa told the paper. “But it is a small sum compared to everything the United States has stolen from Honduras.” Now the solution is clear. Protect our border with deadly force, force these folks back home without a penny. Under no circumstances should these invaders be let in. A letter from the second group of about 50 migrants arrived at the consulate around 1:20 p.m. asking the U.S. to speed up the asylum process and to admit up to 300 asylum seekers each day at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in San Diego. Currently, around 40 to 100 are admitted. “In the meantime, families, women and children who have fled our countries continue to suffer and the civil society of Tijuana continue to be forced to confront this humanitarian crisis, a refugee crisis caused in great part by decades of U.S. intervention in Central America,” the letter states. Of the roughly 6,000 migrants who’ve traveled from Central America to Tijuana, around 700 have returned home, 300 have been deported and 2,500 have applied for humanitarian visas in Mexico, according to Xochtil Castillo, a caravan member who met with Mexican officials Tuesday.

Some snapshots: In just the past few months, record-setting heat waves in Pakistan and India each killed more than 1,000 people. In Washington state’s Olympic National Park, the rainforest caught fire for the first time in living memory. London reached 98 degrees Fahrenheit during the hottest July day ever recorded in the U.K.; The Guardian briefly had to pause its live blog of the heat wave because its computer servers overheated. In California, suffering from its worst drought in a millennium, a 50-acre brush fire swelled seventyfold in a matter of hours, jumping across the I-15 freeway during rush-hour traffic. Then, a few days later, the region was pounded by intense, virtually unheard-of summer rains. Puerto Rico is under its strictest water rationing in history as a monster El Niño forms in the tropical Pacific Ocean, shifting weather patterns worldwide. On July 20th, James Hansen, the former NASA climatologist who brought climate change to the public’s attention in the summer of 1988, issued a bombshell: He and a team of climate scientists had identified a newly important feedback mechanism off the coast of Antarctica that suggests mean sea levels could rise 10 times faster than previously predicted: 10 feet by 2065. The authors included this chilling warning: If emissions aren’t cut, “We conclude that multi-meter sea-level rise would become practically unavoidable. Social disruption and economic consequences of such large sea-level rise could be devastating. It is not difficult to imagine that conflicts arising from forced migrations and economic collapse might make the planet ungovernable, threatening the fabric of civilization.” Eric Rignot, a climate scientist at NASA and the University of California-Irvine and a co-author on Hansen’s study, said their new research doesn’t necessarily change the worst-case scenario on sea-level rise, it just makes it much more pressing to think about and discuss, especially among world leaders. In particular, says Rignot, the new research shows a two-degree Celsius rise in global temperature — the previously agreed upon “safe” level of climate change — “would be a catastrophe for sea-level rise.” Hansen’s new study also shows how complicated and unpredictable climate change can be. Even as global ocean temperatures rise to their highest levels in recorded history, some parts of the ocean, near where ice is melting exceptionally fast, are actually cooling, slowing ocean circulation currents and sending weather patterns into a frenzy. Sure enough, a persistently cold patch of ocean is starting to show up just south of Greenland, exactly where previous experimental predictions of a sudden surge of freshwater from melting ice expected it to be. Michael Mann, another prominent climate scientist, recently said of the unexpectedly sudden Atlantic slowdown, “This is yet another example of where observations suggest that climate model predictions may be too conservative when it comes to the pace at which certain aspects of climate change are proceeding.” Since storm systems and jet streams in the United States and Europe partially draw their energy from the difference in ocean temperatures, the implication of one patch of ocean cooling while the rest of the ocean warms is profound. Storms will get stronger, and sea-level rise will accelerate. Scientists like Hansen only expect extreme weather to get worse in the years to come, though Mann said it was still “unclear” whether recent severe winters on the East Coast are connected to the phenomenon. And yet, these aren’t even the most disturbing changes happening to the Earth’s biosphere that climate scientists are discovering this year. For that, you have to look not at the rising sea levels but to what is actually happening within the oceans themselves. Water temperatures this year in the North Pacific have never been this high for this long over such a large area — and it is already having a profound effect on marine life. Related: Apocalypse Soon: 9 Terrifying Signs of Environmental Doom Eighty-year-old Roger Thomas runs whale-watching trips out of San Francisco. On an excursion earlier this year, Thomas spotted 25 humpbacks and three blue whales. During a survey on July 4th, federal officials spotted 115 whales in a single hour near the Farallon Islands — enough to issue a boating warning. Humpbacks are occasionally seen offshore in California, but rarely so close to the coast or in such numbers. Why are they coming so close to shore? Exceptionally warm water has concentrated the krill and anchovies they feed on into a narrow band of relatively cool coastal water. The whales are having a heyday. “It’s unbelievable,” Thomas told a local paper. “Whales are all over the place.” Last fall, in northern Alaska, in the same part of the Arctic where Shell is planning to drill for oil, federal scientists discovered 35,000 walruses congregating on a single beach. It was the largest-ever documented “haul out” of walruses, and a sign that sea ice, their favored habitat, is becoming harder and harder to find. Marine life is moving north, adapting in real time to the warming ocean. Great white sharks have been sighted breeding near Monterey Bay, California, the farthest north that’s ever been known to occur. A blue marlin was caught last summer near Catalina Island — 1,000 miles north of its typical range. Across California, there have been sightings of non-native animals moving north, such as Mexican red crabs. No species may be as uniquely endangered as the one most associated with the Pacific Northwest, the salmon. Every two weeks, Bill Peterson, an oceanographer and senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Oregon, takes to the sea to collect data he uses to forecast the return of salmon. What he’s been seeing this year is deeply troubling. Salmon are crucial to their coastal ecosystem like perhaps few other species on the planet. A significant portion of the nitrogen in West Coast forests has been traced back to salmon, which can travel hundreds of miles upstream to lay their eggs. The largest trees on Earth simply wouldn’t exist without salmon. But their situation is precarious. This year, officials in California are bringing salmon downstream in convoys of trucks, because river levels are too low and the temperatures too warm for them to have a reasonable chance of surviving. One species, the winter-run Chinook salmon, is at a particularly increased risk of decline in the next few years, should the warm water persist offshore. “You talk to fishermen, and they all say: ‘We’ve never seen anything like this before,’ ” says Peterson. “So when you have no experience with something like this, it gets like, ‘What the hell’s going on?’ “ Atmospheric scientists increasingly believe that the exceptionally warm waters over the past months are the early indications of a phase shift in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a cyclical warming of the North Pacific that happens a few times each century. Positive phases of the PDO have been known to last for 15 to 20 years, during which global warming can increase at double the rate as during negative phases of the PDO. It also makes big El Niños, like this year’s, more likely. The nature of PDO phase shifts is unpredictable — climate scientists simply haven’t yet figured out precisely what’s behind them and why they happen when they do. It’s not a permanent change — the ocean’s temperature will likely drop from these record highs, at least temporarily, some time over the next few years — but the impact on marine species will be lasting, and scientists have pointed to the PDO as a global-warming preview. “The climate [change] models predict this gentle, slow increase in temperature,” says Peterson, “but the main problem we’ve had for the last few years is the variability is so high. As scientists, we can’t keep up with it, and neither can the animals.” Peterson likens it to a boxer getting pummeled round after round: “At some point, you knock them down, and the fight is over.” Attendant with this weird wildlife behavior is a stunning drop in the number of plankton — the basis of the ocean’s food chain. In July, another major study concluded that acidifying oceans are likely to have a “quite traumatic” impact on plankton diversity, with some species dying out while others flourish. As the oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, it’s converted into carbonic acid — and the pH of seawater declines. According to lead author Stephanie Dutkiewicz of MIT, that trend means “the whole food chain is going to be different.” The Hansen study may have gotten more attention, but the Dutkiewicz study, and others like it, could have even more dire implications for our future. The rapid changes Dutkiewicz and her colleagues are observing have shocked some of their fellow scientists into thinking that yes, actually, we’re heading toward the worst-case scenario. Unlike a prediction of massive sea-level rise just decades away, the warming and acidifying oceans represent a problem that seems to have kick-started a mass extinction on the same time scale. Jacquelyn Gill is a paleoecologist at the University of Maine. She knows a lot about extinction, and her work is more relevant than ever. Essentially, she’s trying to save the species that are alive right now by learning more about what killed off the ones that aren’t. The ancient data she studies shows “really compelling evidence that there can be events of abrupt climate change that can happen well within human life spans. We’re talking less than a decade.” For the past year or two, a persistent change in winds over the North Pacific has given rise to what meteorologists and oceanographers are calling “the blob” — a highly anomalous patch of warm water between Hawaii, Alaska and Baja California that’s thrown the marine ecosystem into a tailspin. Amid warmer temperatures, plankton numbers have plummeted, and the myriad species that depend on them have migrated or seen their own numbers dwindle. Significant northward surges of warm water have happened before, even frequently. El Niño, for example, does this on a predictable basis. But what’s happening this year appears to be something new. Some climate scientists think that the wind shift is linked to the rapid decline in Arctic sea ice over the past few years, which separate research has shown makes weather patterns more likely to get stuck. A similar shift in the behavior of the jet stream has also contributed to the California drought and severe polar vortex winters in the Northeast over the past two years. An amplified jet-stream pattern has produced an unusual doldrum off the West Coast that’s persisted for most of the past 18 months. Daniel Swain, a Stanford University meteorologist, has called it the “Ridiculously Resilient Ridge” — weather patterns just aren’t supposed to last this long. What’s increasingly uncontroversial among scientists is that in many ecosystems, the impacts of the current off-the-charts temperatures in the North Pacific will linger for years, or longer. The largest ocean on Earth, the Pacific is exhibiting cyclical variability to greater extremes than other ocean basins. While the North Pacific is currently the most dramatic area of change in the world’s oceans, it’s not alone: Globally, 2014 was a record-setting year for ocean temperatures, and 2015 is on pace to beat it soundly, boosted by the El Niño in the Pacific. Six percent of the world’s reefs could disappear before the end of the decade, perhaps permanently, thanks to warming waters. Since warmer oceans expand in volume, it’s also leading to a surge in sea-level rise. One recent study showed a slowdown in Atlantic Ocean currents, perhaps linked to glacial melt from Greenland, that caused a four-inch rise in sea levels along the Northeast coast in just two years, from 2009 to 2010. To be sure, it seems like this sudden and unpredicted surge was only temporary, but scientists who studied the surge estimated it to be a 1-in-850-year event, and it’s been blamed on accelerated beach erosion “almost as significant as some hurricane events.” Possibly worse than rising ocean temperatures is the acidification of the waters. Acidification has a direct effect on mollusks and other marine animals with hard outer bodies: A striking study last year showed that, along the West Coast, the shells of tiny snails are already dissolving, with as-yet-unknown consequences on the ecosystem. One of the study’s authors, Nina Bednaršek, told Science magazine that the snails’ shells, pitted by the acidifying ocean, resembled “cauliflower” or “sandpaper.” A similarly striking study by more than a dozen of the world’s top ocean scientists this July said that the current pace of increasing carbon emissions would force an “effectively irreversible” change on ocean ecosystems during this century. In as little as a decade, the study suggested, chemical changes will rise significantly above background levels in nearly half of the world’s oceans. “I used to think it was kind of hard to make things in the ocean go extinct,” James Barry of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California told the Seattle Times in 2013. “But this change we’re seeing is happening so fast it’s almost instantaneous.” Thanks to the pressure we’re putting on the planet’s ecosystem — warming, acidification and good old-fashioned pollution — the oceans are set up for several decades of rapid change. Here’s what could happen next. The combination of excessive nutrients from agricultural runoff, abnormal wind patterns and the warming oceans is already creating seasonal dead zones in coastal regions when algae blooms suck up most of the available oxygen. The appearance of low-oxygen regions has doubled in frequency every 10 years since 1960 and should continue to grow over the coming decades at an even greater rate. So far, dead zones have remained mostly close to the coasts, but in the 21st century, deep-ocean dead zones could become common. These low-oxygen regions could gradually expand in size — potentially thousands of miles across — which would force fish, whales, pretty much everything upward. If this were to occur, large sections of the temperate deep oceans would suffer should the oxygen-free layer grow so pronounced that it stratifies, pushing surface ocean warming into overdrive and hindering upwelling of cooler, nutrient-rich deeper water. Enhanced evaporation from the warmer oceans will create heavier downpours, perhaps destabilizing the root systems of forests, and accelerated runoff will pour more excess nutrients into coastal areas, further enhancing dead zones. In the past year, downpours have broken records in Long Island, Phoenix, Detroit, Baltimore, Houston and Pensacola, Florida. Evidence for the above scenario comes in large part from our best understanding of what happened 250 million years ago, during the “Great Dying,” when more than 90 percent of all oceanic species perished after a pulse of carbon dioxide and methane from land-based sources began a period of profound climate change. The conditions that triggered “Great Dying” took hundreds of thousands of years to develop. But humans have been emitting carbon dioxide at a much quicker rate, so the current mass extinction only took 100 years or so to kick-start. With all these stressors working against it, a hypoxic feedback loop could wind up destroying some of the oceans’ most species-rich ecosystems within our lifetime. A recent study by Sarah Moffitt of the University of California-Davis said it could take the ocean thousands of years to recover. “Looking forward for my kid, people in the future are not going to have the same ocean that I have today,” Moffitt said. As you might expect, having tickets to the front row of a global environmental catastrophe is taking an increasingly emotional toll on scientists, and in some cases pushing them toward advocacy. Of the two dozen or so scientists I interviewed for this piece, virtually all drifted into apocalyptic language at some point. For Simone Alin, an oceanographer focusing on ocean acidification at NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle, the changes she’s seeing hit close to home. The Puget Sound is a natural laboratory for the coming decades of rapid change because its waters are naturally more acidified than most of the world’s marine ecosystems. The local oyster industry here is already seeing serious impacts from acidifying waters and is going to great lengths to avoid a total collapse. Alin calls oysters, which are non-native, the canary in the coal mine for the Puget Sound: “A canary is also not native to a coal mine, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a good indicator of change.” Though she works on fundamental oceanic changes every day, the Dutkiewicz study on the impending large-scale changes to plankton caught her off-guard: “This was alarming to me because if the basis of the food web changes, then . . . everything could change, right?” Alin’s frank discussion of the looming oceanic apocalypse is perhaps a product of studying unfathomable change every day. But four years ago, the birth of her twins “heightened the whole issue,” she says. “I was worried enough about these problems before having kids that I maybe wondered whether it was a good idea. Now, it just makes me feel crushed.” Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist and evangelical Christian, moved from Canada to Texas with her husband, a pastor, precisely because of its vulnerability to climate change. There, she engages with the evangelical community on science — almost as a missionary would. But she’s already planning her exit strategy: “If we continue on our current pathway, Canada will be home for us long term. But the majority of people don’t have an exit strategy. . . . So that’s who I’m here trying to help.” James Hansen, the dean of climate scientists, retired from NASA in 2013 to become a climate activist. But for all the gloom of the report he just put his name to, Hansen is actually somewhat hopeful. That’s because he knows that climate change has a straightforward solution: End fossil-fuel use as quickly as possible. If tomorrow, the leaders of the United States and China would agree to a sufficiently strong, coordinated carbon tax that’s also applied to imports, the rest of the world would have no choice but to sign up. This idea has already been pitched to Congress several times, with tepid bipartisan support. Even though a carbon tax is probably a long shot, for Hansen, even the slim possibility that bold action like this might happen is enough for him to devote the rest of his life to working to achieve it. On a conference call with reporters in July, Hansen said a potential joint U.S.-China carbon tax is more important than whatever happens at the United Nations climate talks in Paris. One group Hansen is helping is Our Children’s Trust, a legal advocacy organization that’s filed a number of novel challenges on behalf of minors under the idea that climate change is a violation of intergenerational equity — children, the group argues, are lawfully entitled to inherit a healthy planet. A separate challenge to U.S. law is being brought by a former EPA scientist arguing that carbon dioxide isn’t just a pollutant (which, under the Clean Air Act, can dissipate on its own), it’s also a toxic substance. In general, these substances have exceptionally long life spans in the environment, cause an unreasonable risk, and therefore require remediation. In this case, remediation may involve planting vast numbers of trees or restoring wetlands to bury excess carbon underground. Even if these novel challenges succeed, it will take years before a bend in the curve is noticeable. But maybe that’s enough. When all feels lost, saving a few species will feel like a triumph.

People who are infected with this were diagnosed to have Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS). Experts said that this could also be transmitted from human to human. Based on previous cases, the transmission can hapoen from an infected animals or people through blood, respiratory tract and wounds.The expert who has been handling this cases said that the person who was infected three years ago, passed away and had affected 16 more people. Because of this, all the medical staffs and family members of the patient’s family must take an extra precaution about the infection. He also told everyone to avoid jungles and bushes. On the other hand, ticks don’t fly so it wouldn’t spread that fast. Actually, they rapidly breed in summer but there is still no medicine or vaccine for this. The expert is only considering this as an epidemic in the province of China where patients were diagnosed with this sickness.","A report in the British Medical Journal illustrates how a woman has beaten blood cancer with the help of turmeric. In 2007, 67-year-old Dieneke Ferguson was diagnosed with myeloma and she progressed to stage three within 15 months. Three failed rounds of chemotherapy and four failed stem cell transplants later, doctors told her she had very little hope. She told the U.K.’s Daily Mail: “I have been on all sorts of toxic drugs and the side-effects were terrifying.” She once lost her memory for three days, and two vertebrae in her spine collapsed and had to be injected with a type of concrete for stability. Four years after her initial diagnosis, she took matters into her own hands and started taking a daily dose of curcumin, the key component of turmeric. She took eight grams every evening on an empty stomach. Since then, her cancer has stabilized and her blood counts have returned to normal. She has also enjoyed a good quality of life. When she told her oncologist she was taking turmeric, she reports that he was very interested after seeing what a big difference it made. Myeloma is the second most common type of blood cancer, and it begins in plasma cells in the bone marrow. When these cells become abnormal and begin to multiply, it becomes myeloma and causes severe pain, nerve damage, fatigue and bone damage. Treatment is generally geared toward controlling its symptoms because there is no cure, and people typically don’t live beyond five years of being diagnosed. The BMJ report says that Ferguson’s results suggest that turmeric could be used to help myeloma patients in the future, adding: “The fact that our patient, who had advanced stage disease and was effectively salvaged while exclusively on curcumin, suggests a potential antimyeloma effect of curcumin.” No other possible explanation for her recovery The report’s co-author, Jamie Cavenagh, said that there is no other possible explanation for her remarkable recovery beyond the curcumin. She continues to take the tablets to this day. The scientists are recommending further evaluation in clinical trials to pursue the possibility of using it as an official treatment. This could prove difficult, however, because doctors cannot prescribe it until it has been tested in wide-scale trials that cost millions. Natural compounds cannot be patented, so finding an investor would be extremely difficult. Turmeric benefits a wide range of ailments Turmeric is a perennial herb that contains the natural antioxidant polyphenol curcumin, which also has analgesic properties. It has been shown to inhibit the growth of myelomaand several other types of tumor cells. Some of the other illnesses that can benefit from curcumin include infections, dementia, depression and heart disease. A 2016 review in the Journal of Medicinal Food highlighted its potential for arthritis treatment, and doctors have also applauded its anti-inflammatory effects. A recent study found that it can help destroy neuroblastoma tumor cells, showing promise as a way to treat the most common type of cancer in infants. Another study is expected to be published soon showing its positive effects on bowel cancer. Although Ferguson said she took turmeric on an empty stomach, it is usually recommended that people take it with a fat or oil to help boost its absorption because it is a fat-soluble compound. Many people enjoy turmeric with yogurt or warm milk. In addition, studies have shown that taking it with black pepper boosts absorption significantly; many supplements also contain a small amount of black pepper for this reason. It’s wonderful to hear that people are successfully treating problems that doctors cannot conquer using nothing more than what nature has provided us. Not everyone will have the same success that Ferguson did, but the fact that natural solutions can help people turn around “hopeless” situations deserves further exploration, profit possibilities or not.",other,
80ce6667,"Global Hot Air: Here's a United Nations climate report that environmentalists probably don't want anybody to read. It says that even if every country abides by the grand promises they made last year in Paris to reduce greenhouse gases, the planet would still be ""doomed."" X When President Obama hitched America to the Paris accords in 2016, he declared that it was ""the moment that we finally decided to save our planet."" And when Trump pulled out of the deal this year, he was berated by legions of environmentalists for killing it. But it turns out that the Paris accord was little more than a sham that will do nothing to ""save the planet."" According to the latest annual UN report on the ""emissions gap,"" the Paris agreement will provide only a third of the cuts in greenhouse gas that environmentalists claim is needed to prevent catastrophic warming. If every country involved in those accords abides by their pledges between now and 2030 — which is a dubious proposition — temperatures will still rise by 3 degrees Celsius by 2100. The goal of the Paris agreement was to keep the global temperature increase to under 2 degrees. Eric Solheim, head of the U.N. Environment Program, which produces the annual report, said this week that ""One year after the Paris Agreement entered into force, we still find ourselves in a situation where we are not doing nearly enough to save hundreds of millions of people from a miserable future. Governments, the private sector and civil society must bridge this catastrophic climate gap."" The report says unless global greenhouse gas emissions peak before 2020, the CO2 levels will be way above the goal set for 2030, which, it goes on, will make it ""extremely unlikely that the goal of holding global warming to well below 2 degrees C can still be reached."" Not to worry. The UN claims that closing this gap will be easy enough, if nations set their collective minds to it. But this is a fantasy. The list of what would need to be done by 2020 — a little over two years from now — includes: Boosting renewable energy's share to 30%. Pushing electric cars to 15% of new car sales, up from less than 1% today. Doubling mass transit use. Cutting air travel CO2 emissions by 20%. And coming up with $1 trillion for ""climate action."" Oh, and coal-fired power plants would have to be phased out worldwide, starting now. According to the report, ""phasing out coal consumption … is an indispensable condition for achieving international climate change targets."" That means putting a halt to any new coal plants while starting to phase out the ones currently in use. Good luck with that. There are currently 273 gigawatts of coal capacity under construction around the world, and another 570 gigawatts in the pipeline, the UN says. That would represent a 42% increase in global energy production from coal. Does anyone really think developing countries who need coal as a cheap source of fuel to grow their economies will suddenly call it quits? So, does this mean the planet is doomed? Hardly. As we have noted in this space many times, all those forecasts of global catastrophe are based on computer models that have been unreliable predictors of warming. And all of the horror stories assume the worst. What the report does make clear, however, is that all the posturing by government leaders in Paris was just that. Posturing. None of these countries intended to take the drastic and economically catastrophic steps environmentalist claim are needed to prevent a climate change doomsday. As such, Trump was right to stop pretending. Whether you believe in climate change or not, the Paris climate accord amounted to nothing, or pretty close to it. Even the UN admits that now.

57eba0b9,"According to NOAA’s own historical data, of the 50 U.S. state all-time record high temperatures, 23 were set during the 1930s, while 36 occurred prior to 1960 — climate change proponents are feeding us a fairy tale, and I’m sick of it… The maniacal sociopaths of the world may have won control of the narrative, but they seemingly have little sway over the will of the people. You need only browse the comment section below any “climate change” article or social media post to see the wave of folks resoundingly rejecting the scam-of-a-world-view assembled before them (one of the few positives of SM). The man-made global warming rejection is likely down to two things: the first being that the so called “scientific consensus” has been failing for far too long — you can’t start warning people in the 1980s that we have 10 years left to save the planet, only to keep repeating that prophecy for the next 4 decades. This is probably the reason our youth have become the new target — kids don’t have this history of failure to draw-upon when browsing the bullet points of the latest IPCC report -for example- meaning they’re far easier to manipulate. The second reason is likely the availability of climate information these days–namely historical data. Thanks to the internet, researching past climate catastrophes and comparing them to what’s happening today is a simple task. I’m talking about raw historical data, such as the number of deaths caused by a certain natural disaster, or the year and decade of the highest U.S. state temperature records: The raw data ALWAYS speaks for itself — out of the 50 U.S. state record high temperatures, 23 were set during the 1930s, while 36 occurred prior to 1960. But the powers that be have constructed a rather tenacious, loud, and bullish narrative–as on top of the world burning to a crisp, the story also warns that droughts and floods are becoming more extreme. Comfortably crushing that assertion, however, is another NOAA nugget named the Palmer Drought Index — a century+ dataset plotting the portion of the continental U.S. that is either very wet or very dry. What the index reveals is that there is no significant trend of increasing drought or flood: An uptick in hurricanes is another li(n)e we’re fed, it’s actually listed as one of the main results of human-caused global warming. But again, there is no dataset out there that supports either an increase or an intensification of severe storms. In fact, quite the opposite is true, with 9 of the 13 strongest hurricanes to make U.S. landfall occurring prior to 1965. NOAA data shows both the number of hurricanes and the number of “strong” hurricanes making U.S. landfall declining since 1900. NOAA data also reveals that the number of strong tornadoes has been declining since the 1970s. When folks are permitted to look at climate data prior to 1980, natural cycles ALWAYS reveal themselves. There are ups & there are downs, and there are ups & downs within the ups & downs — and not a single scientist on the planet fully understands the mechanisms involved, no matter what you’re told. Saying that, however, sensible and tested “guesswork” is the basis of science. Recognizing the climate works in cycles means certain things can be predicted — the Grand Solar Minimum is one such cycle. Warmth is good for life on Earth, for biodiversity — the peaks of past human civilizations have ALWAYS coincided with Grand Solar Maximums (Minoans & Romans, for example), while their downfalls have ALWAYS been marked by Minimums and the coinciding temperature drops low solar activity brings. We humans should only ever be concerned with the COLD. If only man-made global warming was real… but as with ALL OTHER fairy tales to have ever done the rounds, these fabricated worries are put in place to control you, to have you lose sleep over something you can’t quite understand, and to have you pay, in one way or another, for your sins… Social Media channels are restricting Electroverse’s reach — be sure to subscribe to receive new post notifications by email (the box is located in the sidebar >>> or scroll down if on mobile).

58b372a7,"Bois State University told The Daily Wire Thursday that despite Wilson identifying himself as a student and an associate professor at the school, he is “not a current student nor employee of the university.” Original story: A Black Lives Matter activist in Boise, Idaho, has been arrested in connection to a vandalized statue of former President Abraham Lincoln. Terry Joe Wilson, 37, was arrested late Tuesday night after a warrant was issued for his arrest last week, The Idaho Statesman reported. Wilson has identified himself online as an associate professor at Boise State University and has been described by the press as the Boise Black Lives Matter chapter spokesman. Both physical and electronic evidence were reportedly used to identify suspects in the vandalism incident, which occurred in February. “[T]he bronze statue of Lincoln in Julia Davis Park — known as ‘Seated Lincoln’ — vandalized with feces, paint and signs,” The Idaho Statesman reported. “Parks and recreation staff were able to clean the statue, which was not permanently damaged.” The suspect fled from officers when he was first approached for his arrest, the Boise Police Department said. When he was tracked down, Wilson was found in possession of a firearm, marijuana, and drug paraphernalia. “Officers chased after Wilson and were able to stop him and take him into custody, at which time Wilson was found to be in possession of a firearm, marijuana and drug paraphernalia,” said a press release from the department. “Wilson was taken to the hospital and was medically cleared before being booked into the Ada County Jail.” “Wilson was charged with several misdemeanor counts, including injuring monuments, ornaments and public improvements, resisting and obstructing officers, possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia,” The Idaho Statesman reported. An account for Wilson describes himself as an associate professor at Boise State University.On Wilson’s Instagram page, one captioned photo from November railing against “fascist Donald Tump and neoliberal Joe Biden” identifies himself as “a student & faculty” at the university. The post, which also includes support for Black Lives Matter, reads as follows: Like the fascist @realdonaldtrump, the neoliberal @joebiden wants to increase police funding despite decades of research to support the position that police do not prevent crime. In-fact policing perpetuates crime & criminality with the support of the courts and corrections.

The outlines had red smears over where the hearts would be.” The report added: “Terry Wilson II, the spokesperson for the Boise chapter, said in a phone call the demonstration at Clegg’s home was because she was one of the four council members who voted to approve Mayor Lauren McLean’s 2021 budget. The 2021 budget allocates more money for the Boise Police Department, even though the overall budget decreased from 2020. … Wilson said the chapter wanted to hold Clegg accountable for her vote, which he called ‘bad policy.'” More arrests in connection to the vandalism incident are expected to be forthcoming.","Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein arrested and accused of sex trafficking minors, sources say",other,

According to the reports, the girl was taken to the hospital after she complained about stomach pains, couldn’t eat, and had been constipated for five days.

According to EBC Dongsen News, the patient reluctantly admitted she had drank a bubble tea five days earlier; however, the doctor who treated her said it would have taken a lot more boba to get to this point. The doctor prescribed laxatives for the girl to get the undigested pearls out of her system. As EBC Dongsen News reports, the director of Zhuji People’s Hospital’s emergency department said that boba, being made of tapioca starch, are already difficult to digest, but some makers also use thickeners and preservatives, the significant consumption of which may lead to gastrointestinal problems.

One senior Labour figure – a veteran of Tony Blair's Downing Street administration with strong links to Washington – claimed to The Mail on Sunday that Ms Markle, 39, was networking among senior Democrats with a view to building a campaign and fundraising teams for a tilt at the US Presidency. Last night, a source close to the Duchess of Sussex declined to comment, but the couple have made little secret of their political beliefs. One senior Labour figure claimed that Meghan Markle (pictured last year), 39, was networking among senior Democrats with a view to building a campaign and fundraising teams for a tilt at the US Presidency During the US election last year they levelled a thinly veiled attack on Donald Trump by urging voters to 'reject hate speech', which a spokesperson for the couple described as 'a call for decency'. Trump himself declared that he was 'not a fan' of Meghan, 39. A source said: 'The Blairite, internationalist and Democratic party networks are buzzing with talk about Meghan's political ambitions and potential backers.' Last year, a friend of the Duchess told Vanity Fair magazine that one of the reasons she did not give up her American citizenship when she married into the Royal Family was to allow her to keep open the option of entering Washington politics. US constitutional experts responded that she would have to renounce her title if she wanted to hold public office in the States, because it would cut across the US oath of allegiance. Buckingham Palace tried to distance the Royal Family from the remarks made during the US election by issuing a statement saying that 'the Duke is not a working member of the Royal Family' and describing his comments as 'made in a personal capacity'. The source added that the presumption was that the Duchess was eyeing 2024, when President Joe Biden will be 82 and deciding whether he wants to run for a second term.

9f10a8a9,"It was an accurate and judicious answer, so naturally it sent climate alarmists into paroxysms of condemnation. The Washington Post slammed Pruitt as a “denier” driven by “unreason.” Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii called Pruitt’s views “extreme” and “irresponsible” — proof of his unfitness to head the EPA. Gina McCarthy, who ran the agency under President Obama, bewailed the danger global warming poses “to all of us who call Earth home,” and said she couldn’t “imagine what additional information [Pruitt] might want from scientists” in order to understand that. Replied Pruitt: “No. I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact. So no — I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. But we don’t know that yet. We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis.” ‘Do you believe,” CNBC’s Joe Kernen asked Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency’s new director, in an interview last Thursday, “that it’s been proven that CO2 is the primary control knob for climate?” Yet for all the hyperventilating, Pruitt’s answer to the question he was asked — whether carbon dioxide is the climate’s “primary control knob” — was entirely sound. “We don’t know that yet,” he said. We don’t. CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases. By contrast, carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere: about 400 ppm (parts per million), or 0.04 percent. Moreover, its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm. Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red. A second coat of paint has much less of an effect, while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all. Advertisement There is a popular theory that atmospheric CO2 amplifies the creation of water vapor, thereby increasing warming through a “positive feedback loop.” But that theory so far is mostly speculative; climate projections using models based on it have consistently failed, nearly always predicting far more warming than has occurred. It should go without saying that if scientists cannot yet make accurate predictions about future climate change, then their understanding of climate science remains highly incomplete. Advertisement Earth’s climate system is unfathomably complex. It is affected by innumerable interacting variables, atmospheric CO2 levels being just one. The more variables there are in any system or train of events, the lower the probability of all of them coming to pass. Your odds of correctly guessing the outcome of a flipped coin are 1 in 2, but your odds of guessing correctly twice in a row are only 1 in 4 — i.e., ½ x ½ Extending your winning streak to a third guess is even less probable: just 1 in 8. Apply that approach to climate change, and it becomes clear why the best response to the alarmists’ frantic predictions is a healthy skepticism. The list of variables that shape climate includes cloud formation, topography, altitude, proximity to the equator, plate tectonics, sunspot cycles, volcanic activity, expansion or contraction of sea ice, conversion of land to agriculture, deforestation, reforestation, direction of winds, soil quality, El Niño and La Niña ocean cycles, prevalence of aerosols (airborne soot, dust, and salt) — and, of course, atmospheric greenhouse gases, both natural and manmade. A comprehensive list would run to hundreds, if not thousands, of elements, none of which scientists would claim to understand with absolute precision. Advertisement But for the sake of argument, say there are merely 15 variables involved in predicting global climate change, and assume that climatologists have mastered each one to a near-perfect accuracy of 95 percent. What are the odds that a climate model built on a system that simple would be reliable? Less than 50/50. (Multiplying .95 by itself 15 times yields 46.3 percent.) Is it any surprise that climate-change predictions in the real world — where the complexities are exponentially greater and the exactitude of knowledge much less — have such a poor track record? Pruitt got it right: Measuring human impacts on climate is indeed “very challenging.” The science is far from settled. That is why calls to radically reduce carbon emissions are so irresponsible — and why dire warnings of what will happen if we don’t are little better than reckless fearmongering.",A 62% Top Tax Rate?,other,
c9c7a951,"Climate crisis and logging is leading to shift from canopy rainforest to open grassland. Climate crisis and logging is leading to shift from canopy rainforest to open grassland. Much of the Amazon could be on the verge of losing its distinct nature and switching from a closed canopy rainforest to an open savannah with far fewer trees as a result of the climate crisis, researchers have warned. Rainforests are highly sensitive to changes in rainfall and moisture levels, and fires and prolonged droughts can result in areas losing trees and shifting to a savannah-like mix of woodland and grassland. In the Amazon, such changes were known to be possible but thought to be many decades away. New research shows that this tipping point could be much closer than previously thought. As much as 40% of the existing Amazon rainforest is now at a point where it could exist as a savannah instead of as rainforest, according to a study published in the journal Nature Communications. Any shift from rainforest to savannah would still take decades to take full effect, but once under way the process is hard to reverse. Rainforests support a vastly greater range of species than savannah and play a much greater role in absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Parts of the Amazon are receiving much less rain than they used to because of the changing climate. Rainfall in about 40% of the forest is now at a level where the rainforest could be expected to exist as savannah instead, according to the study, led by the Stockholm Resilience Centre, based on computer models and data analysis.
Last year, Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, was warned that the continued destruction of the Amazon by fire and loggers would bring the region closer to a tipping point where rainforest could turn to savannah. This year’s fires in the Amazon are the worst in a decade, with a 60% increase in fire hotspots compared with last year. Arie Staal, lead author of the study, said the ecology of rainforests meant that although they effectively produce their own self-sustaining rainfall in the right climate, they are also prone to drying out in the wrong conditions. “As forests grow and spread across a region, this affects rainfall,” he explained. “Forests create their own rain because leaves give off water vapour and this falls as rain further downwind. Rainfall means fewer fires leading to even more forests.” But if large areas of rainforest are lost, rainfall levels in the region decline accordingly. This reduced level of “atmospheric moisture recycling” was simulated in the computer models used in the study. “Drier conditions make it harder for the forest to recover and increase the flammability of the ecosystem,” Staal told the Guardian. Once rainforest has crossed the threshold and converted to an open savannah-type mix of wood and grassland, it is unlikely to revert naturally to its former state. “It is harder to return from the ‘trap’ caused by the feedback mechanism in which the open, grassy ecosystem is more flammable, and the fires, in turn, keep the ecosystem open,” he said.

Source: Staal et al, Nature Communications, Obbe Tuinenburg The team of researchers ran computer simulations of where forests might be expected to exist across the earth’s tropical regions, given certain climatic conditions, and looked at the minimum and maximum areas of likely forest cover. They also looked at what was likely to happen if greenhouse gas emissions kept rising, and found that the ability of forests to grow back once trees were lost would be much reduced. Ingo Fetzer of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, co-author of the paper, said: “We understand now that rainforests on all continents are very sensitive to global change and can rapidly lose their ability to adapt. Once gone, their recovery will take many decades to return to their original state. And given that rainforests host the majority of all global species, all this will be forever lost.”",Zakharova Says New Salisbury Claims Aim to Distract Public From the Incident,other,
4b28c12a,"(CNN) The stakes were high when Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren met at Warren's apartment in Washington, DC, one evening in December 2018 . The longtime friends knew that they could soon be running against each other for president. The two agreed that if they ultimately faced each other as presidential candidates, they should remain civil and avoid attacking one another, so as not to hurt the progressive movement. They also discussed how to best take on President Donald Trump, and Warren laid out two main reasons she believed she would be a strong candidate: She could make a robust argument about the economy and earn broad support from female voters. Sanders responded that he did not believe a woman could win. The description of that meeting is based on the accounts of four people: two people Warren spoke with directly soon after the encounter, and two people familiar with the meeting. After publication of this story, Warren herself backed up this account of the meeting, saying in part in a statement Monday, ""I thought a woman could win; he disagreed."" That evening in 2018, Sanders expressed frustration at what he saw as a growing focus among Democrats on identity politics, according to one of the people familiar with the conversation. Warren told Sanders she disagreed with his assessment that a woman could not win, three of the four sources said. Sanders denied the characterization of the meeting in a statement to CNN. ""It is ludicrous to believe that at the same meeting where Elizabeth Warren told me she was going to run for president, I would tell her that a woman couldn't win,"" Sanders said. ""It's sad that, three weeks before the Iowa caucus and a year after that private conversation, staff who weren't in the room are lying about what happened. What I did say that night was that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could. Do I believe a woman can win in 2020? Of course! After all, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 3 million votes in 2016."" Warren's communications director Kristen Orthman declined to comment. These previously unreported details from the two senators' private meeting shed new light on the careful efforts that Warren and Sanders appear to have made to manage their friendship and political rivalry even before the 2020 race was officially underway. From the start, even as both candidates were determined to capture the Democratic nomination, they were also keenly sensitive to the risk that their rivalry could divide the progressive movement. The conversation also illustrates the skepticism among not only American voters but also senior Democratic officials that the country is ready to elect a woman as president, several years after one clinched a major political party's nomination for president for the first time. Many Democrats believe sexism played a role in Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 general election, and voters say they are torn about whether to try again to put a woman in the White House in 2020. The revelation that Sanders expressed skepticism that Warren could win the presidency because she is a woman is particularly noteworthy now, given that Warren is the lone female candidate at the top of the Democratic field. And notably, their meeting in December 2018 came just weeks after a record number of women had been elected to the House of Representatives, helping to deliver the majority to the Democrats. Democrats have been intensely debating questions of identity and representation in recent years, and the party's historically diverse field of White House candidates this cycle has featured multiple women. Sanders himself weighed in shortly after the 2016 election, saying that ""one of the struggles that you're going to be seeing in the Democratic Party is whether we go beyond identity politics."" ""I think it's a step forward in America if you have an African American CEO of some major corporation. But you know what, if that guy is going to be shipping jobs out of this country, and exploiting his workers, it doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot whether he's black or white or Latino,"" he said at an appearance in Boston to promote his book, according to WBUR ""Name your favorite woman president"" Warren has grown increasingly vocal over the past few months on the role of sexism and gender inequality in politics, including experiences the Massachusetts Democrat said she has endured in the years that she has been in public office. On the campaign trail, Warren tells voters the story of how some male colleagues have advised her to ""smile more"" and being discouraged from running for Senate in 2012 because she was a woman. ""Over and over, we are told that women are not allowed to be angry. It makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet,"" Warren wrote in a campaign email in November, with the subject line: ""I am angry and I own it."" Three weeks ahead of the Iowa caucuses, Warren is now the only woman polling in the double-digits nationally. A new CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll showed Warren in a four-way race in Iowa, along with Sanders, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden. In that survey, Sanders and Warren performed nearly equally well as the top choice among female likely Democratic caucusgoers, while Sanders and Buttigieg were the top choice among men. Last month, Warren said in Las Vegas that she had ""lived enough of my life with men, and it's mostly been men, telling me to sit down and be quiet."" Days later, she acknowledged that this was a dynamic she had experienced in the current campaign. Warren's rivals have also grappled with the issue of sexism in politics. Biden recently said on the campaign trail that Clinton had confronted ""unfair"" sexist attacks in the last election, and added: ""That's not going to happen with me."" Sen. Amy Klobuchar said recently that female candidates with as little political experience as Buttigieg would not have qualified for the presidential debate. ""Women are held to a higher standard,"" the Minnesota Democrat said. ""Otherwise we could play a game called 'Name Your Favorite Woman President,' which we can't do because it has all been men."" A fraying non-aggression pact The New York Times first reported over a year ago that Warren and Sanders met in Washington in December 2018. That initial report said that neither senator sought each other's support, and that they did not try to dissuade one another from running in the 2020 election. If Warren and Sanders agreed on a non-aggression pact of sorts that night, that agreement has become increasingly frayed. Over the last year, Sanders aides and advisers have taken to social media to criticize Warren on numerous issues, including ""Medicare for All,"" student loan debt cancelation and the ""wealth tax."" Some of his allies have also implicitly and explicitly gone after Warren on the broader question of who has the rightful claim to the progressive mantle in 2020. ""People have to decide do they want originals or do they want copies,"" Nina Turner, Sanders' campaign co-chair, told CNN over the summer. ""He's the original."" Politico reported over the weekend on the Sanders campaign's talking points instructing volunteers to say that Warren's supporters are ""highly-educated, more affluent people who are going to show up and vote Democratic no matter what"" and that ""she's bringing no new bases into the Democratic Party."" Campaigning in Marshalltown, Iowa, Warren told reporters that she was ""disappointed to hear that Bernie is sending his volunteers out to trash me."" ""Bernie knows me, and has known me for a long time,"" Warren said. ""He knows who I am, where I come from, what I have worked on and fought for, and the coalition and grassroots movement we're trying to build."" Sanders himself appeared to distance himself from the memo, saying on Sunday that his campaign has ""hundreds of employees"" and that ""people sometimes say things that they shouldn't."" ""I have never said a negative word about Elizabeth Warren, who is a friend of mine,"" Sanders said.

Liberty Counsel — a law firm focused on religious freedom — caught wind of a Nebraska elementary school principal who banned a long list of Christmas-related items, among them candy canes because the ""J"" shape stands ""for Jesus."" Liberty Counsel — a law firm focused on religious freedom — caught wind of a Nebraska elementary school principal who banned a long list of Christmas-related items. Special: What kinds of items, you ask? Liberty Counsel provided a memo from principal Jennifer Sinclair that spelled out in detail all the verboten paraphernalia at Manchester Elementary School in Omaha: Santas or Christmas items (clip art) on worksheets Christmas trees in classrooms Elf on the Shelf — that's Christmas-related Singing Christmas carols Playing Christmas music Sending a Scholastic book that is a Christmas book — that's Christmas-related Making a Christmas ornament as a gift —This assumes that the family has a Christmas tree which assumes they celebrate Christmas. I challenge the thought of, ""Well they can just hang it somewhere else."" Candy Cane — that's Christmas-related. Historically, the shape is a ""J"" for Jesus. The red is for the blood of Christ, and the white is a symbol of his resurrection. This would also include different colored candy canes.

Howard Santa Claus School workshop on Oct. 17, 2008, in Midland, Michigan. What was the principal's reasoning? Sinclair — who's in her first year as Manchester's principal — noted in the memo that she ""come[s] from a place that Christmas and the like are not allowed in schools"" and that ""as a public school"" Manchester Elementary will be seek to be ""inclusive and culturally sensitive to all of our students."" ""I have unknowingly awoken a 'sleeping giant' with many of you,"" she added. ""I apologize for the stress that 'Christmas/holiday/ Grinch/Santa/tree' emails and conversations have caused you.""

""Please reflect on what you've already copied, prepped and posted,"" Sinclair concluded. ""I'm hopeful we can avoid the discomfort of me directly questioning something you've copied, posted and had your kids do. That makes me uncomfortable, and I know it doesn't feel good."" She signed the memo, ""The (Unintentional) Grinch who stole Christmas (from Manchester)."" What happened next? Liberty Counsel sent a demand letter to the superintendent of Elkhorn Public Schools about the Christmas ban, urging it to ""immediately overrule and specifically disavow the sweeping directive banning Christmas holiday items, and require Principal Sinclair to undertake review of District policy and the law."" How did the district respond? Believe it or not, the district's response to Liberty Counsel said it had ""investigated this matter and determined that Principal Sinclair's memorandum did not comply with Board Policy"" and that Manchester staffers were advised that ""certain Christmas symbols"" are permissible. What did Liberty Counsel have to say? ""We are pleased that Elkhorn Public Schools promptly reversed Principal Jennifer Sinclair's unconstitutional directive, and required compliance with the Constitution,"" Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, said in a statement. ""The First Amendment does not require elimination of Christmas. Nothing prohibits public schools from teaching objectively about Christmas or other holidays with religious significance, from displaying religious and secular Christmas symbols side-by-side or singing sacred and secular Christmas songs together. The First Amendment prohibits censorship based on religious viewpoint. This outrageous three-page memo by Principal Sinclair was not based on ignorance of the law but hatred toward Christianity and Christmas. Principal Sinclair should issue an apology to her teachers and staff."" UPDATE, 1:28 p.m. Dec. 6: A school district spokesperson told TheBlaze that Sinclair issued an apology. The spokesperson also noted the district's statement on the matter: ""Elkhorn Public Schools District administration promptly addressed the issue at Manchester Elementary School regarding the memo that was sent by the principal to Manchester elementary staff. The memo does not reflect the policy of Elkhorn Public Schools regarding holiday symbols in the school. The District has since clarified expectations and provided further direction to staff in alignment with District policy. This issue was limited to Manchester Elementary School and did not arise at any other schools within the District.""",Principal banned candy canes because 'J' shape stands 'for Jesus.'

7d021245,"The phone number to report Iowa caucus results was posted on a fringe internet message board on Monday night along with encouragement to “clog the lines,” an indication that jammed phone lines that left some caucus managers on hold for hours may have in part been due to prank calls. An Iowa Democratic Party official said the influx of calls to the reporting hotline included “supporters of President Trump who called to express their displeasure with the Democratic Party.” The party official’s comments were first reported late Wednesday by Bloomberg News. Users on a politics-focused section of the fringe 4chan message board repeatedly posted the phone number for the Iowa Democratic Party, which was found by a simple Google search, both as screenshots and in plain text, alongside instructions. ""They have to call in the results now. Very long hold times being reported. Phone line being clogged,"" one user posted at about 11 p.m. ET on Monday, three hours after the caucuses began. ""Uh oh how unfortunate it would be for a bunch of mischief makers to start clogging the lines,"" responded another anonymous user, sarcastically. Some users chimed in, posting alleged wait times on hold, imploring others to “clog the lines [and] make the call lads.” Rob Sand, state auditor of Iowa, said he took results calls on Monday night as a volunteer and received an influx of calls that appeared to have been generated by a post on the internet. “A lot of calls came in at a certain point where it was clear somebody had published the hotline number somewhere,” Sand said. He cautioned that he could not speak for other people who were taking calls and said he did not get any calls that said they were from Trump supporters. He added that the system prevented people from reporting fake results. He also said he was able to identify fake calls quickly. “If I picked up the phone and it was clear after the first handful of words that someone was not calling to report the results, I just hung up,” Sand said. Mandy McClure, communications director for the Iowa Democratic Party, confirmed that the hotline received “an unusually high volume of inbound phone calls to its caucus hotline, including supporters of President Trump.” “The unexplained, and at times hostile, calls contributed to the delay in the Iowa Democratic Party’s collection of results, but in no way affected the integrity of information gathered or the accuracy of data sets reported,” McClure said in a statement. The telephone reporting problems added to other issues, notably a smartphone app that did not work for some people and that also had a coding problem that prevented results from being reported properly, pushing more caucus volunteers to the phone lines. Iowa Democratic Party officials said that party staff members and volunteers flagged and subsequently blocked repeat callers who appeared to be reaching out in an attempt to interfere with their reporting duties. These included callers who would hang up immediately after being connected and callers who expressed support for Trump and displeasure with the Democratic Party. It’s unclear how many prank calls the party received or how much they contributed to wait times. Some calls came from Iowans looking to confirm details of their evening’s caucus, party officials said. The party has not responded to requests for information on how many individuals were manning the phone lines on Monday night. The Trump campaign denied any affiliation with people clogging phone lines on Monday night. “We don’t know anything about this, but perhaps Democrats should consider using an app that works,"" communications director Tim Murtaugh said. ""It's laughable that they would try to blame Trump for their own incompetence."" Several officials at caucuses attended by NBC News reporters struggled with lengthy hold times that made it impossible for them to report results. 4chan, which hosts an anonymous and often extremist politics board called /pol/ whose users have largely supported Trump since 2015, is known for extensive online political trolling and targeted harassment campaigns. On debate nights, 4chan users often direct one another to swarm and manipulate specific online polls on other websites with repeat votes, a practice known as “brigading” in online communities. The polls would then be used by politicians and partisan websites to claim shocking upsets. Users on 4chan are anonymous, and usernames are randomly generated with each new thread. Some users on 4chan pushed back against users claiming to spam phone lines on Monday night. One user said he didn’t want other trolls “making us the scapegoat for the DNC.” “I can’t wait for the news headlines saying nefarious trolls ruined the caucus,” another added. Two precinct chairs said they were unaware of any interference with the hotline and doubted it made much of an impact. “I wouldn’t blame the Republicans,” said Tom Courtney, co-chair of the Des Moines County Democratic Party and a precinct chair. “I’d love to blame the Republicans and the Trumpers, but I don’t know.” Mike Carberry, chair for a precinct in Iowa City, also said he doubted prank calls were the primary reason for long wait times. “I’m sure that they got some calls, but those could be sorted through relatively quickly,” he said. Another hotline staffer who asked to remain anonymous said they were aware of the prank calls but that they were not the main reason that results were delayed. “It was definitely a problem,” the staffer said. “But it was definitely not the reason that results were a mess.”",Clog the lines': Internet trolls deliberately disrupted the Iowa caucuses hotline for reporting results,other,
905519d3,"Diabetes prescriptions are costing the NHS in England more than £1 billion a year, according to figures from NHS Digital. The total cost of the prescriptions has risen significantly - by more than £422 million - in the last 10 years. Almost one in 20 prescriptions written by GPs are now for diabetes treatment. The biggest increases are seen in treatments for type 2 diabetes, which affects around 90% of diabetes patients. Robin Hewings, head of policy at the charity Diabetes UK, said the figures reflect a dramatic rise in the incidence of diabetes. The number of people diagnosed with diabetes has doubled in the last 20 years, and it is responsible for 26,000 early deaths per year alongside serious complications such as blindness, amputation or stroke. This data shows that diabetes prescribing costs £1bn, but it is estimated that the total cost to the NHS is over £10bn a year, so the real price we have to pay for diabetes is not medications, but the devastating and expensive complications. Mr Hewings pointed out that drug costs have not risen significantly during this period, and that the increase in prescribing costs is largely a result of the rise in prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes signs 'detectable years earlier' 'Postcode lottery' for diabetes monitors Diabetes 'info prescription' plan Presentational grey line The rise in diabetes There are now over three million people in England with a diagnosis of diabetes. The number has doubled over the last two decades and there are nearly 100,000 diagnoses per year. 92% of recorded diagnoses of diabetes relate to type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes, unlike type 1, is closely linked to lifestyle factors and is preventable through lifestyle change. Almost seven out of 10 men are overweight or obese 66.8% and almost six out of 10 women are overweight or obese 57.8% in England. Source: NHS England Presentational grey line Type 2 diabetes is caused by the body not producing enough insulin, or by the body's cells not reacting to the insulin that is present, resulting in high blood sugar. It may be controlled by diet, or by antidiabetic drugs or insulin, or both. Type 2 is caused by a variety of factors, some of which are out of people's control, but more than 80 percent is caused by obesity or being overweight. In overweight and obese people, type 2 diabetes can be prevented and reversed by losing weight. The NHS England figures also include the cost of devices used by people with diabetes to monitor their condition. Nearly £477 million was spent on antidiabetic drugs in 2017-18. Over the same year, around £350 million was spent on insulin, and £181 million on diagnostic and monitoring devices. Professor Jonathan Valabhji, national clinical director for diabetes and obesity at NHS England, said: Thanks to better diagnosis and treatment, the NHS is caring for more people than ever before with diabetes, and this new data highlights the urgent need to prevent type 2 diabetes from developing in the first place. The NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme has now reached over a quarter of a million people at high risk of type 2 diabetes.","Renationalising railways supported by almost two thirds of Britons, exclusive poll reveals",other,
168e5898,"Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide has helped raise global food production and reduce poverty. National polls show that climate change is low on the list of voters’ priorities. For good reason: In the U.S., and for much of the world, the most dangerous environmental pollutants have been cleaned up. U.S. emissions of particulates, metals and varied gases—all of these: ozone, lead, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and sulfur—fell almost 70% between 1970 and 2014. Further reductions will come from improved technologies such as catalytic removal of oxides of nitrogen and more-efficient sulfur scrubbers. This is a boon to human health. But a myth persists that is both unscientific and immoral to perpetuate: that the beneficial gas carbon dioxide ranks among hazardous pollutants. It does not. Unlike genuine pollutants, carbon dioxide (CO2) is an odorless, colorless gas. Every human being exhales about two pounds of CO2 a day, along with a similar amount of water vapor. CO2 is nontoxic to people and animals and is a vital nutrient to plants. It is also a greenhouse gas which helps maintain earth at a habitable temperature. Fear of excessive warming from more CO2 in the atmosphere, including that released from human activity, has caused some people to advocate substantial and expensive reductions in CO2 emissions. But observations, such as those on our CO2 Coalition website, show that increased CO2 levels over the next century will cause modest and beneficial warming—perhaps as much as one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit)—and that this will be an even larger benefit to agriculture than it is now. The costs of emissions regulations, which will be paid by everyone, will be punishingly high and will provide no benefits to most people anywhere in the world.",NHS fails thousands of new mothers with post-natal depression,other,
87a297a2,"The NHS Long Term Plan, published today, will save almost half a million more lives with practical action on major killer conditions and investment in world class, cutting edge treatments including genomic tests for every child with cancer.  The blueprint to make the NHS fit for the future will use the latest technology, such as digital GP consultations for all those who want them, coupled with early detection and a renewed focus on prevention to stop an estimated 85,000 premature deaths each year.  Measures outlined by NHS leaders today will help prevent 150,000 heart attacks, strokes and dementia cases while more than three million people will benefit from new and improved stroke, respiratory and cardiac services over the next decade.  Patients will benefit from services ranging from improved neonatal care for new parents and babies to life-changing stroke therapy and integrated support to keep older people out of hospital, living longer and more independent lives.  The NHS Long Term Plan is also the first time in the NHS’ 70 year history when there will be a new guarantee that investment in primary, community and mental health care will grow faster than the growing overall NHS budget. This will fund a £4.5 billion new service model for the 21st century across England, where health bodies come together to provide better, joined up care in partnership with local government.  The commitment to tackle major physical conditions comes alongside the biggest ever investment in mental health services rising to at least £2.3 billion a year by 2023/24. Building on significant expansion in recent years, the long term plan will see around two million more people who suffer anxiety, depression or other problems receive help over the next decade including new dads as well as mums, and 24 hour access to crisis care via NHS 111.  The NHS Long Term Plan will also:  Open a digital ‘front door’ to the health service, allowing patients to be able to access health care at the touch of a button  Provide genetic testing for a quarter of people with dangerously high inherited cholesterol, reaching around 30,000 people  Give mental health help to 345,000 more children and young people through the expansion of community based services, including in schools  Use cutting edge scans and technology, including the potential use of artificial intelligence, to help provide the best stroke care in Europe with over 100,000 more people each year accessing new, better services  Invest in earlier detection and better treatment of respiratory conditions to prevent 80,000 hospital admissions and smart inhalers will be piloted so patients can easily monitor their condition, regardless of where they are  Ensure every hospital with a major A&E department has ‘same day emergency care’ in place so that patients can be treated and discharged with the right package of support, without needing an overnight stay.  NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said: “The NHS has been marking its 70th anniversary, and the national debate has rightly centred on three big truths. There’s been pride in our health service’s enduring success, and in the shared social commitment it represents. There’s been concern – about funding, staffing, increasing inequalities and pressures from a growing and ageing population. And there’s also been legitimate optimism – about the possibilities for continuing medical advance and better outcomes of care.  “In looking ahead to the Health Service’s 80th birthday, this NHS Long Term Plan acts on all three of these realities. It keeps all that’s good about our health service and its place in our national life. It tackles head-on the pressures our staff face. And it sets a practical, costed, phased route map for the NHS’s priorities for care quality and outcomes improvement for the decade ahead.”  Seventy years after the NHS was founded, the health service will expand care for patients and their families at every stage of life, supporting people to start well, live well and age well.  The NHS will be the first health service in the world to offer whole genome sequencing for children with cancer and young people who have a rare genetic disorder, in addition to adults suffering from certain rare conditions or specific cancers.  The new, individually tailored treatments will be introduced alongside cutting edge testing services that will mean three quarters of cancer patients are diagnosed early, when the condition is easier to treat, up from half at present, saving 55,000 lives a year.  Around 23,000 premature deaths and 50,000 hospital admissions will be prevented over the next decade by putting over 100,000 patients with heart problems through a healthy living and exercise programme every year.  Children and young people’s health will be a priority with the introduction of a new transformation programme to oversee delivery of commitments for the next ten years, from bringing mental and physical care together to services for 0-25 years so that care is timely and continuous.  A renewed focus on prevention including action to help people live healthier lives will stop thousands of people developing life threatening or limiting conditions, including the expansion of the Diabetes Prevention Programme.  And as more people live longer, care will increasingly be delivered in people’s homes or somewhere convenient, freeing up space in hospitals for those who need it most.  Ian Dalton, chief executive of NHS Improvement, said: “At the heart of the NHS are hard-working staff who pull out all the stops to care for patients every day. It is thanks to their dedication that the NHS is admired around the world and that it has taken great strides over the last seven decades.  “We need to build on these achievements and make the best use of the new investment to fundamentally reset how the NHS is run so that our growing and ageing population can get the right care at the right time and in the right place.  “This means breaking down organisational barriers to take a more holistic approach to how care is delivered and paid for, embracing new and existing forms of technology, recruiting and retaining the right number of staff, and shifting the focus away from hospitals to prevention and care in the community.  “Developed by those working within the NHS, the long term plan sets out an exciting roadmap for how we will do this together for the benefit of patients.”  Professor Carrie MacEwen, chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges said: “It’s good to have a plan which sets a clear direction for the NHS and tackles many of the issues the Academy has long been saying need to be addressed if we are to improve patient care. Our challenge now is to make sure it’s properly implemented and in this regard we, that is everyone who works in the NHS and patients who use the service, must all play our part if we are to make it a success.”  Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation said: “This plan is a welcome and significant step in the fight against heart and circulatory diseases, which promises to save thousands of lives in the coming years.  “The plan’s strong focus on improving prevention and detection of heart and circulatory diseases and their risk factors has the potential to make a huge difference, ensuring that deaths rates fall further in the future. In addition, better care and support for people living with heart failure will significantly improve quality of life for many.  “It’s now essential that work gets underway on making this transformational plan a reality.”  Paul Farmer, chief executive of Mind, said: “We are really pleased to see that mental health is such a key focus in the NHS long term plan and we welcome the £2.3bn set aside for mental health services. This is the kind of sustained investment we need to see to put mental health on an equal footing with physical health and, if delivered, this plan will make a difference to the lives of thousands of people with mental health problems.  “Everyone now needs to work together to develop the workforce needed and to deliver these plans and to ensure the money reaches the frontline. Local decision makers need to develop their own plans and the proof of delivery will be in the experiences of people trying to access the services they need.”  Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan, said:  “It’s been a privilege to work with NHSE shaping the cancer section of the long term plan. I’m delighted that cancer has continued to remain a high priority. One in two people will get a cancer diagnosis during their lifetime and the plan lays out important milestones around improving survival and ensuring high quality personalised care for every patient. I look forward to continuing to work with the NHS to meet these milestones and to improve cancer care for patients now and in the future.”",NHS Long Term Plan to tackle major killer conditions and save up to half a million lives,other,
5225b538,"Hospitals have axed 15,000 beds in just six years, leaving wards at ‘breaking point’, a shock report reveals today.  The dramatic reduction – equivalent to closing 24 hospitals – amounts to a 10 per cent fall in NHS beds at a time when the health service is under unprecedented pressure.  There are now just 129,458 hospital beds available for patients at night, down from 144,455 in 2010/11.  Critics say patients’ safety is at risk and blame the cuts on an NHS obsession with shifting care out of hospitals and ‘closer to home’.  The dramatic reduction – equivalent to closing 24 hospitals – amounts to a 10 per cent fall in NHS beds at a time when the health service is under unprecedented pressure  Health officials say patients recover more quickly if they are looked after in their own homes by GPs, district nurses and carers, but many surgeries and councils do not have the resources to care for people who would previously have stayed longer in hospital.  At the same time, demand for beds is soaring due to the pressures of a social care crisis, immigration and an ageing population, with many more patients succumbing to long-term illnesses and frailty.  New figures today will suggest the problem is likely to get worse. Regulator NHS Improvement will warn that despite being given a £1.8 billion cash injection from the Government last year, hospitals are on course for a £1 billion deficit by the end of this year.  The figures will spark a fresh debate about whether the NHS is contributing to its problems by squandering precious resources.  One report yesterday said hospitals had blown £2 billion by overpaying for items such as toilet roll, blinds and wet wipes, with items that could have been sent in one hospital’s internal mail being sent by Royal Mail instead.  The British Medical Association BMA warned that the loss of 15,000 beds ‘risked patient safety’ because nothing had been done to improve the level of care at home.  The lack of beds means hospitals are having to cancel operations at the last minute – including cancer and heart surgery – or send patients home before they have properly recovered.  Hospitals have axed 15,000 beds in just six years, leaving wards at ‘breaking point’, a shock report reveals today  The BMA report also highlights how the NHS has fewer beds per head than nearly every country in Europe  The BMA report also highlights how the NHS has fewer beds per head than nearly every country in Europe. The UK has an average of 2.4 beds per 1,000 population, compared to Germany 8, Austria 7.5 and France 6.  And it raises concerns over occupancy rates on wards. Hospitals are not meant to be more than 85 per cent occupied, but the report highlights figures showing that nine out of ten exceeded this over the winter. Several hospitals are 99 or even 100 per cent occupied with patients at much higher risk of infections and neglect.  Last week an inquest heard that grandmother Mary Muldowney, 57, from Crawley, West Sussex, died from a brain haemorrhage after three hospitals refused to admit her because they had no beds.  Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the BMA’s council, said: ‘These figures paint an even bleaker picture of an NHS that is at breaking point.  Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the BMA’s council, said: ‘These figures paint an even bleaker picture of an NHS that is at breaking point'  ‘High bed occupancy is a symptom of wider pressure and demand on an overstretched and underfunded system. It causes delays in admissions, operations being cancelled and patients being unfairly and sometimes repeatedly let down.  'The delays that vulnerable patients are facing, particularly those with mental health issues, have almost become the norm and this is unacceptable.’  The bed shortage is being exacerbated by the bed-blocking crisis, caused by the problems in the social care sector. With a shortage of home help and places at residential care homes, elderly and vulnerable patients are staying in hospital longer than they should.  Former health minister, Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb, said: ‘The situation is getting intolerable, with more cancelled operations, longer delays and those with mental health issues being systematically let down. The Government is failing to properly fund the NHS and patients are paying the price.’  Today’s figures cover all hospital beds, including those on general and maternity wards, as well as in mental health and learning disability centres. An average hospital has 634 beds, so a loss of 15,000 beds is equivalent to almost 24 hospitals.  Fiona Johnson, of the Nuffield Trust think-tank, said: ‘The extremely high level of bed occupancy in England’s hospitals creates pressure-cooker conditions for the NHS.  ‘The drive to achieve efficiencies by reducing bed numbers has become counterproductive, as there is no slack in the system to accommodate surges in demand and as a result procedures and operations get delayed.’  Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ‘The shameful reality is this overcrowding puts patients at risk and blows apart ministers’ claims to be prioritising safety.’  FAMILY DOCTORS ARE OFFERING FIVE-MINUTE APPOINTMENTS Family doctors are offering patients urgent appointments lasting only five minutes in a bid to meet soaring demand. A snapshot survey found several surgeries offering the same-day slots for anyone who thinks they need to be seen immediately. This includes parents worried about sick children or patients with chest pain or breathing difficulties. GP appointments in England usually last ten minutes and are already among the shortest in Europe. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, of the British Medical Association, said: ‘Five minutes is woefully too short. 'Nine out of ten GPs say they cannot manage in ten-minute appointments.’ Advertisement  An NHS England spokesman said: ‘Modern treatment advances such as minimally invasive surgery, fast-acting anaesthetics and medicines taken at home mean that the length of time patients spend in hospital has been falling in all Western countries.  ‘The NHS is highly efficient overall, but there are still meaningful differences in discharge practices and community support across England.’  The Department of Health said: Our hospitals are busier than ever but thanks to the hard work of staff, our performances are still among the best in the world. We have backed the NHS’s own plan for the future with an extra £10 billion by 2020.’","NHS cuts 15,000 beds in six years",other,
1c068671,"Pressure on the government to help struggling Britons has intensified after a leading thinktank warned that falling living standards for the poor threatened the biggest rise in inequality since Margaret Thatcher was prime minister.  The Resolution Foundation said Theresa May would need to make good on her pledge to support “just about managing” households as it released a report showing that rising inflation and an end to recent strong jobs growth would hit the least well-off hardest.  Its warnings chime with other forecasts for a squeeze on family budgets on the back of sluggish wage growth, welfare cuts, rising global oil prices and the pound’s sharp fall since the Brexit vote. The drop in sterling has made imports more expensive and there are already signs that is being passed on to consumers, with inflation hitting its highest level for more than two years in December.  The Resolution Foundation’s study found that the current parliament would be the worst for living standards for the poorest half of households since comparable records began in the mid-1960s and the worst since the early years of Thatcher’s 1979-90 premiership for inequality.  Since its sharp increase in the early 1980s – a period of high unemployment, factory closures and a cut in the top rate of tax from 83% to 60% – inequality has broadly remained flat.  But the Resolution Foundation forecast that between 2015 and the next general election in 2020 incomes for the poorest half of households will fall by 2%.  That compares with a rise of 4% during the last parliament and 1% between 2005 and 2010 – the five-year period that included the deepest recession since the 1930s.    Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said: “Britain has enjoyed a welcome mini-boom in living standards in recent years. But that boom is slowing rapidly as inflation rises, productivity flatlines and employment growth slows.  “The squeeze in the wake of the financial crisis tended to hit richer households the most. But this time around it’s low- and middle-income families with kids who are set to be worst affected.  “This could leave Britain with the worst of both worlds on living standards – the weak income growth of the last parliament and rising inequality from the time Margaret Thatcher was in Downing Street.  “The prime minister’s focus on supporting just managing families is absolutely right if we are to avoid the next few years being like the 1980s without the feelgood factor.”  The prediction that inequality is set to start rising again is based on the thinktank’s forecast that while incomes will fall for the poorer half of households they will rise by about 5% for the richest fifth over the next four years.  The foundation blames the upcoming living standards squeeze on a combination of stagnating pay, rising inflation and the rollout of more than £12bn of welfare cuts. It emphasised that the pound’s weakness since the Brexit vote and other economic factors such as flat productivity growth were only part of the picture. The unequal nature of the squeeze would be the result of government policy on tax and benefits.    “The vote to leave the European Union does not, thus far, appear to have impacted on the macroeconomy or employment, but it has hastened the end of ultra-low inflation and increased how far it is likely to rise in the next few years,” the report said.  “But, in some ways regardless of the average level of household income growth, Britain is also actively choosing to increase inequality. Despite welcome policies such as the national living wage, the plans the new prime minister has inherited are likely to ensure that the proceeds of growth are shared unequally and many families made worse off.”    The thinktank sees inequality rising to record highs by 2020 on three different measures: the 90:10 income ratio, which is the income of a household 90% up the income distribution scale, divided by that of a household only 10% of the way up; on the 80:20 ratio, calculated in a similar way from those 80% up the distribution and those 20% up; and on the Palma ratio, the income share of the top 10% divided by the income share of the bottom 40%.  “All forecast measures show large increases in inequality over the next four years, with all reaching record highs by 2020-21. This is a starkly different pattern from the trend of the past 20 years, over which time inequality has been broadly flat or even declining,” the report said.    Underscoring the challenge for May’s government as it seeks to redress deep regional imbalances in the UK, the Resolution Foundation also highlighted persistent inequalities between south-east England and the rest of the country.  Incomes in the vast majority of the country were more than 10% lower than in most wealthy region, south-east England, its analysis found. North-east England and the West Midlands had the lowest levels of income, both 20% lower than in the south-east.  On the capital, the report added: “Contrary perhaps to received wisdom London is not the region with the highest income, and once housing costs are taken into account, incomes in the region are roughly 10% lower than in the south-east.”  A spokesperson for the Treasury said: “Living standards reached their highest ever level in 2015, and are forecast to be higher still by the end of the parliament.    “Millions of people are taking home more of what they earn thanks to the government’s actions to reduce income tax bills and introduce the national living wage. We are helping households with the cost of living by increasing the supply of affordable housing, banning letting agents’ fees, and freezing fuel duty, and our investment to boost productivity will raise living standards in the long run.”  John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the Resolution Foundation was damning: “Labour called on the government at the autumn statement to end the unfair cuts to in work benefits, while they were going ahead with tax giveaways to a wealthy minority, but Philip Hammond chose to carry on with the work of his predecessor.  “It is becoming clearer by the day that working families will be forced to pay for a Tory Brexit that favours the rich and not the rest of us, as our country faces its biggest rise in inequality since Margaret Thatcher.”","UK faces return to inequality of Thatcher years, says report",other,
2574e017,"  Doc calls for a return to negotiations By DR JONATHAN STANLEY 12th January 2016, 12:01 am Updated: 6th April 2016, 9:54 am  TODAY my colleagues are going out on strike.  It is unprecedented, threatens patients’ dignity and safety — and it is unnecessary.  For me, it’s also illegal. That’s why today, I’m calling — along with think tank the Bow Group — for the British Medical Association BMA to call off its strikes and return to negotiations to bag the settlement we all need.  Savvy tactics from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt led to the Government going in too hard in talks none of us can walk away from.  That’s why a ballot was held.  But even back in November there was no reason why the BMA couldn’t have gone to mediators Acas first before upping the ante.  No one can honestly say that doctors, or the conditions on offer, are the same as what they were when the ballot was called. For me, the strike mandate ended when Acas talks started.  READ MORE:  Corbyn’s mob in doc strike as Momentum sends lefties to join picket line  Strike by junior doctors could drag on ‘for months’, says union boss  Moet medics: High life of docs’ leaders who are heading up NHS strike  Just days before the current talks broke down we all saw BMA reps briefing the media about how badly the whole thing was going.  Union bigwigs close to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn turned up the heat and the talks, naturally, collapsed.  With little chance of Labour returning to power any time soon we are now seeing Corbyn’s “new kind of politics” — a return to direct action to undermine the Government come what may.  His friends inside my union are leveraging the trust and goodwill we’ve spent years building and are weaponising my colleagues and our patients.  There has been no attention given to the victims of recent floods, who have lost so much and had operations cancelled.  With these strikes going ahead it is nonsense to say we can diagnose and treat cancers on time or that we can continue to see those suffering with mental health problems.  And it is nonsense to say the whole profession is behind the strikes — so many grades weren’t even balloted.  There are many different voices saying how many patients may die from understaffing over weekends and over these strikes.  The research I’ve worked on with the Bow Group suggests that more than two hundred lives could be lost just over the three days of industrial action this month.  There is our human side to this debate too. Thousands of us have worked hard to get into medicine.  We see so many patients suffer from their illnesses and are privileged to be there to help them as best we can.  I’ve worked as a doctor since 2005. I see the devastation when an operation is delayed, the anguish when a cancer is picked up late.  Paying me any more or working me any less will never blunt what I see.  Fair wages are fair, and I support the BMA in arguing for them.  Talks collapse ... Dr Stanley blames Corbyn's 'new type of politics' for breakdown  Reuters 1  We all want fair pay through negotiation. But there are many aspects of safety the current talks haven’t even touched upon.  For example, changing our rotas so senior doctors can stay on two weeks more in August — when newly qualified doctors start — would help the new doctors begin their careers in a safer and more supportive environment.  I’m sick of hearing how my colleagues will leave the country if they don’t get all that they want, that they’ll somehow be forced on to a plane to the Great Barrier Reef.  No one is forcing anyone to do anything and we have a debt to repay.  Doctors are one in eight of all NHS staff but we get three-fifths of the training budget.  That’s great, of course, because we really do need the best training to treat you. But why can’t clawbacks be written into our contracts so that if we leave as consultants for warmer climes we must pay back our training?  It takes £400,000 to train a GP — and for surgeons and cardiologists it’s even more.  Two thousand senior doctors leaving the UK would cost us a billion. More than twice that number applied to work abroad just last year.  But with competition for training and for medical school so high, I have to admit we’ve been too easy on those wishing to walk off with the loot.  In fact, if we did close this loophole maybe Jeremy Hunt would have more money to spend on nurses, medicines and, yes, on increasing our pay too.  I have seen emails and briefings from BMA negotiators attacking the Government, calling Hunt a liar, calling for other unions and left-wing groups to join pickets.  I won’t breach confidentiality by publishing these documents, you’ll have to take my word for it.  These briefings are not in my name, and they don’t represent the views of most junior doctors I know.  They make it clear to me there are elements of the BMA that wanted a strike from the moment they got their ballot and have no intention of returning to talks.  Where does that leave the public?  Strikes, I fear, will increase in number and severity.  Maybe, in time for May’s local elections, Corbyn will ride to the rescue and save the day from the strikes he prompted. He may even reward some of his Labour friends inside the profession, but the end result will be a conspiracy against the public and the patients.  I support the BMA, I have been a member for ten years. It does vital work for doctors and, ultimately, serves all of our interests.  But it has allowed a few members with a radical left-wing agenda very different to the union’s own to hijack it.  I will lose friends in calling out this failure to avoid strikes where possible.  I remember my early days of training at Sheffield Medical School and its motto shines through: “The art is long and life is short.”  The standing, trust and legacy of the medical profession is bigger than this showdown — and it has to be. There is a difference between being a professional and an employee. This is an employee dispute, but we are professionals crucial to the life of the nation.  We need to start acting like it.  — Dr Jonathan Stanley is a junior doctor and a member of the Royal College of Surgeons.

f0737897,"Our NHS is safer in Europe: #NHSsaferIN  14 Jun 2016, by Frances O'Grady in Public services  Today I’m proud to be joining NHS staff and supporters at a rally at Congress House. We’re coming together to say don’t risk a leave vote – Don’t risk our NHS. And there’s a lot to concern us, whether we work in the NHS or rely on it for our families’ health care.  To start with, there’s the potential loss of so many talented NHS staff from the EU. That could unleash a staffing crisis in the NHS.  Where on earth would our NHS be without all the staff who are so dedicated to it: The doctors, nurses and support staff? The NHS staffing roster includes 50,000 staff from the European Economic Area – including 9,000 doctors, 18,000 nurses and midwives, and over 2,000 other health professionals.  These are people who fill crucial skills gaps, and use their incredible knowledge and expertise to help save British lives.  Of course the government should be investing more in training opportunities for locals. Our government’s NHS bursary cuts have been the worst thing possible in dealing with a growing training crisis.  But migrants don’t clog the NHS up – they prop it up.  Yes, our NHS is at breaking point. Staff are over-worked and services are stretched. But that’s not because of decent, hard-working migrants who pay their way. Migrants are often younger people, less likely to need health services than the average UK citizen but still paying UK taxes to support them.  The NHS is in a staffing crisis because the government has imposed another five-year spending freeze. The Tories’ pay cap has created recruitment and retention problems throughout the service, which means more and more taxpayers money is wasted on agencies and management consultants, increasing our deep reliance on EU healthcare staff.  Across the NHS, staff are demoralized – fed up with too little funding to help the patients they care so deeply about, too many top down reorganisations and not enough ministerial respect. And fed up that their dedication is being taken for granted.  The EU’s Working Time Directive means we have rules that protect staff wellbeing, and don’t needlessly risk patient safety. We already have dedicated health staff putting in long hours, but many Brexit leaders want to overturn their rights to refuse excessive working hours and push them to work even longer.  And of course funding for the NHS depends on Britain’s economy doing well. Pretty much everyone agrees leaving the EU will hit the economy even brexiteers admit it would hurt in the short term, and that will put our crisis hit NHS even deeper in trouble.  Based on IFS analysis, if we leave the EU, the public purse is likely to lose enough money each year to fund the whole of NHS England for 3 months.  Of course not all the public spending cuts would fall on the NHS. But it could still be as much as £10 billion a year by the end of the decade. Equivalent to every hospital trust in England cutting 1,000 nurses and 155 doctors.  But the thing that gets me about the discussion of the NHS in this referendum campaign is the hypocrisy. Because when did the leading lights of Brexit ever give a toss about the NHS?  Does anyone really believe that Boris Johnson cares about the NHS? That’s the same Boris Johnson who is on record saying he doesn’t believe in a free NHS; and that if people paid for services, they’d value them more.  Or Michael Gove who co-authored a book saying the NHS is “no longer relevant in the 21st century”? Or Iain Duncan Smith, who has said he’d prefer a social insurance system? Or even Nigel Farage, who believes that within the next ten years the NHS should be replaced by private health insurance?  I don’t believe they support the NHS as we know and love it, any more than I believe they oppose the EU/US TTIP trade deal. If we came out of the EU, these men would sign us up to their own secret trade deals like a shot. We wouldn’t even know about the deals; let alone have the chance to change them.  But perhaps the Leave campaign’s most shameful fib of all is the claim that leaving the EU would mean more money for the NHS. Frankly, I was gobsmacked when I first saw the Leave campaign’s battle bus slogan.  As the Tory MP and former GP Sarah Wollaston said last week, when she defected from leave to remain: “it simply isn’t true”. Even if we trusted them to do the right thing with the cash, the sums simply don’t add up. They’ve been repeatedly slammed for it by the UK’s statistics watchdog.  The leave campaign are fond of saying we remainers are negative. To be honest when faced with a change that could cause such damage it’s hard not to be. But there are also positive reasons to vote Remain for our NHS.  Being in the EU helps make our NHS better. It means a common set of professional standards across the EU. And when you’re away for work or on holiday, British citizens get the right to free healthcare in other member states.  It also means significant funding for research and development into health. Just last year, the UK received £232 million of EU money – incidentally the largest slice of funding received by any EU member state. That included vital money for research at Great Ormond Street children’s hospital, University Hospital Birmingham and NHS Blood and Transplant services. It keeps the NHS at the forefront of healthcare worldwide.  So we have a choice to make. To build our NHS – or risk it. To back our NHS – or privatise it. And to celebrate and cherish NHS staff – or demonise and divide them. A vote to Leave isn’t just a big gamble with jobs, wages and rights, it’s also a big gamble with our NHS.  The NHS was built by and for working people. It is about solidarity, collaboration and co-operation. And it is too special, too precious, to entrust to the privatising Tories and UKIP, who are pushing Brexit as a way towards a deregulated, low-tax and low-services UK.  The NHS needs to be safeguarded if it’s going to be able to care for our children and grandchildren. I’ll be voting remain to do that.",Our NHS is safer in Europe: #NHSsaferIN,other,
f2a01c39,"Rises in National Insurance Contributions NICS for self-employed workers have been criticised as penalising entrepreneurs.  Chancellor Philip Hammond announced in the Budget that the rate for Class 4 NICS would rise from 9% to 10% in April 2018, and to 11% in 2019.  That compares to 12% currently paid by employees.  The difference in National Insurance Contributions is no longer justified, Mr Hammond said.  Self-employed people have traditionally paid lower NICS than employees, as they receive fewer state benefits.  But the chancellor said the self-employed now had equal access to the new state pension. He also said that the government would consult on parental benefits, some of which self-employed people cannot claim.  The chancellor said all self-employed people who earned less than £16,250 would be better off.  Around half of the 4.8 million workers registered as self-employed earn less than £13,000, according to the think tank the Resolution Foundation.  As a result it said most such workers - such as low-paid hairdressers - will be better off by 2019/20. line Winners and Losers hairdresserimage copyrightGetty Images      A self-employed hairdresser - with average earnings of £12,700 - will be £70 better off       A self-employed taxi driver - with average earnings of £17,300 - will be £20 worse off      A self-employed management consultant - with average earnings of £51,100 - will be £620 worse off.  source: Resolution Foundation line  But the rise, which will cost those affected an average of 60p a week, was criticised by entrepreneurs.  Increasing National Insurance rates for the self-employed could be a further step by the government to penalise those who are taking risks and starting a business, said Lucy-Rose Walker, the chief executive of Entrepreneurial Spark.  Others said it was unfair that the self-employed would have to pay more, when they do not receive the same level of state benefits.  Self-employees are subject to a lower national insurance contribution because they do not receive the same entitlements and benefits as their employed counterparts - such as holiday and sick leave, said Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of tax at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants.

Matthew Taylor, head of the Royal Society of Arts, is due to produce a report on how the self-employed are taxed later this year.

62b8396b,"Pupils in most secondary schools are being taught by staff not trained in the subject they are teaching, according to a new report.  A survey of 885 schools by the Association of School and College Leaders, which represents secondary school heads, reveals 73 per cent were having to put teachers not trained in the subject they were teaching in front of classes. In addition, 84 per cent said that teacher shortages were having a detrimental effect on the education they were providing.  The subject areas worst hit by what has been described by ASCL president Allan Foulds as a “national crisis” are maths where 78 per of schools are having to make do with staff not trained in the subject, science 75 per cent and English 57 per cent.  Other problem areas are languages with 33 per cent of schools using non-specialist teachers, geography 25 per cent and history 14 per cent. In all, 89 per cent said they were experiencing difficulties in recruiting teachers.  Last month, the National Audit Office revealed that the Department for Education has failed to meet its recruitment targets for trainee teachers for the past four years. The Chief Inspector of Schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, also warned last week of a “brain drain” as teachers opt for jobs in satellite schools abroad, set up by many of the country’s leading independent schools.  The survey coincides with the ASCL’s annual conference this weekend, at which the Education Secretary, Nicky Morgan, is expected to be put under pressure to take action on teacher shortages.  “Teacher shortages leave schools with no option other than to use stop-gap solutions,” said Malcolm Trobe, ASCL general secretary. “Supply staff and non-specialists often do a good job in difficult circumstances, but it is no substitute for having permanent teachers who are experts in their subjects.”  Please enter your email address Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP Thanks for signing up to the News newsletter {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Under the Universal Support regime, officials will take personal charge of each case to ensure they get treatment, mental health counselling and other support.  Iain Duncan Smith said it costs the taxpayer £10.1billion a year to support people addicted to drugs file photo  Once people have found a job, they will remain under the care of the jobcentre until they are doing sufficient hours to leave the accompanying Universal Credit benefits regime altogether.  The work and pensions secretary said the aim was to find jobs for people who had been ‘parked’ on a life on benefits by the last government.  Mr Duncan Smith added: ‘Too often in the past, people with complex barriers such as addiction, indebtedness or homelessness were written off to a life on benefits.  'Through Universal Support we are putting an end to this, and offering wraparound support for those that need it.  ‘These problems are the root causes of poverty – and if not tackled mean that the cycle of disadvantage will continue into the next generation.’  He pointed to a devastating report by the Lankelly Chase Foundation which found the wider cost to the taxpayer of supporting people with the most severe problems was £10.1 billion a year.  Mr Duncan Smith, pictured, has faced fierce criticism from the Church for his welfare reforms  There are 586,000 people categorised as having at least one serious problem – such as addiction to drink or drugs or homelessness.  Officials said the aim was to reduce the cost of social breakdown by addressing all the ‘barriers’ they face to getting on in life and finding a job.  One said: ‘This is not about cutting benefits – it is about reducing the need.’  Mr Duncan Smith revealed that, for the first time, the Department of Health had acknowledged that having a job improved a person’s health and well-being.  The new policy will allow people who claim mental health problems are preventing them from finding work to access more support.  In about 60 per cent of cases, the problem they have is anxiety or depression.  Help will also be available for people who have problems with housing, childcare, debt and a history of offending.  Mr Duncan Smith has faced fierce criticism from the Church and critics on the Left for his welfare reforms, which they claimed would create ‘unacceptable’ suffering.  But, following a raft of changes to the benefits system designed to incentivise work, the number of children growing up in homes in which nobody has a job has plummeted by 478,000.  The overall number of households where no one was in work fell to the lowest on record in 2015 – almost 700,000 fewer than in 2010.","Addicts and alcoholics cost us £10billion a year, says Duncan Smith",other,
7b9e930d,"The use of cocaine in Britain has doubled in seven years, as one in 50 Londoners currently snorts the drug daily.  An analysis of Britain's waste water, carried out by forensic scientists at King's College London, has also proved that the purity of the class A drug has gone up, hitting a record high.  Tests of the drug in sewage show Londoners are taking almost 200,000 doses of cocaine every day, which amounts to about £700,000.  The research found that one in 50 Londoners currently takes the drug on a daily basis  Concentrations in waste water are 900 milligrams per 1,000 of the population per day, which rose from 392 milligrams per 1,000 in 2011.  The average cocaine dose through smoking or snorting is 40 milligrams, meaning that, in a population of nine million people, one in 50 is taking the class A drug on a daily basis.  The research also found out that the use of cocaine in London is almost as high during weekdays as it is at the weekend.  The use of cocaine in London is almost as high during the week as it is at the weekend  Last year, the Global Drug Survey reported that the British capital is one of cities in the world where cocaine can be delivered faster than pizza, thanks to the use of smartphones and encrypted messaging services.  London, Bristol, Barcelona, Antwerp, Zurich and Amsterdam are considered the top cities in Europe for the use of cocaine.  A study carried out by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in 2015 found that London was the city with the highest concentration of cocaine in its sewage in Europe.  Cocaine purity is soaring thanks to the increased supply and production in Latin America  Traces of the drug have been found in fish and shrimps in Suffolk.  A study published last summer found that endangered eels could become 'hyperactive' because of the presence of drugs in Britain's waters.  Biologists at the University of Naples Federico II also found that the the drugs accumulate in the animals' brains, muscles, gills and skin.  Dr Leon Barron, who led the latest analysis at King's College London, said the purity of cocaine has also risen through the increased supply and production in Latin America.  Recent research by the National Crime Agency confirmed cocaine purity is at 'historically high levels'.  Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan Police commissioner, said cocaine users often fuel gang violence and knife crime.  Pure cocaine is sold for about £100 per gram on the street.  Cocaine seizures have trebled in five hears, from 42.8 tons in 2013-14 to 122.9 tons in 2017-18, The Telegraph reported.  Dr Barron said treating sewage can remove most of the cocaine from waste water before it is recycled into rivers.",Britain's cocaine use doubles in last seven years as one in 50 Londoners snorts the drug daily,other,

The British Infrastructure Group BIG, headed by Conservative MP Grant Shapps, urged new prime minister Theresa May to show her mettle by ending the speculation.  Its report entitled Gate Now Closing , which was published on Sunday July 24, calls for an urgent and immediate decision on hub airport expansion.  The report does not state where group thinks a new runway should be built, but it argues that the indecision is having a deleterious effect on Britain's businesses, the economy and jobs.  'Problem of capacity... causing substantial damage'  The problem of capacity at the current hub, Heathrow, is causing substantial damage to the industry as a whole, the report says.  It erodes confidence in the Government's stated ambition of growing the economy and our international trade.  The evidence has been gathered by the Airports Commission.

d8c5eecd,"Teachers who leave the profession for other jobs are taking substantial pay cuts, a new study published tonight reveals.  The research by the NFER National Foundation for Educational Research looked at teachers who left for different occupations over the past 14 years and found that, on average, their pay dropped by 10 per cent, compared with those who stayed in teaching.  It reveals that some teachers – who left to become teaching assistants or who took up a job in the public sector – saw a drop in their wages of up to 30 per cent.  Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said she knew of a teacher who had become a bus driver because they felt “anything was preferable to the lack of quality of life” that came with teaching.  “The fact that teachers are taking lower paid jobs reflects the desperation that many teachers feel, she said. The relentless nature of the workload and pressure is leading to teachers just walking. They can see no way they can remain in teaching and so they lose professional status and money.”  But the NFER analysis, of the government Labour Force Survey LFS data, can only indicate how the teachers' pay has changed in the short term as the LFS only follows up individuals for one year.  The Should I Stay or Should I Go? report concludes: “The short-term pay benefits from a career move may be limited by the need to prove value to new employers and develop skills for a different career. The prospect of higher pay in the longer-term may still have been a motivation for some teachers who left teaching.”  The report added that it is “possible that career-changers from other professions experience a similar fall in wages and this phenomenon is not likely to be unique to teaching.”  According to the research, more than half 51 per cent of teachers who leave teaching take up jobs in the education sector excluding those who leave to retire.  Carole Willis, NFER chief executive, said: “Recruiting and retaining good quality teachers is a key issue facing the education system over the next five to 10 years. Understanding the types of jobs former teachers are going into and their underlying motivations is crucial for formulating an appropriate policy response.”  The NFER analysed a sample of 6,896 teachers, including 936 who left teaching and 774 who joined teaching, over a 14-year period 2001-2015.

Young children do not play a significant role in spreading the virus and are significantly less likely to become infected than adults, according to a review of existing research into Covid-19 and children by the Royal College of Paediatricians and Child Health RCPCH said.  It worked with other research teams to examine the correlation in studies of transmission from children to adults after public health officials in Switzerland said today under-10s could finally hug their grandparents again as they pose no risk to them.  The review, by the Don't Forget the Bubbles paediatric research project, stated: Notably, the China/WHO joint commission could not recall episodes during contact tracing where transmission occurred from a child to an adult.  Image: REUTERS  But the review also urged caution as it is still unknown whether children have passed on the virus, particularly given large numbers of asymptomatic cases.  A nine-year-old British boy who contracted coronavirus in a French Alps did not pass it on, despite having contact with more than 170 people at three schools. This case was studied as part of the research.  Dr Alasdair Munro, the clinical research fellow in paediatric infectious diseases who led the research, said: Covid-19 appears to affect children less often, and with less severity, including frequent asymptomatic or sub-clinical infection.  There is evidence of critical illness, but it is rare.  The role of children in transmission is unclear, but it seems likely they do not play a significant role.  Professor Russell Viner, the president of the RCPCH, said: From around the world, we are not seeing evidence that children are involved in spreading or transmitting the virus, but we do not have enough evidence.  Prof Viner added that it was too soon to say children could hug their grandparents, particularly as the over-70s are the most vulnerable.  Note: Children are not believed to play a significant role in the spread of coronavirus.

d17185d3,"Like what?  Helen Harwatt is a researcher trained in environmental nutrition, a field focused on developing food systems that balance human health and sustainability. She’s interested in policy, but realistic about how much progress can be expected under the aforementioned leadership. So she and colleagues have done research on maximizing the impacts of individuals. As with so many things in life and health, that tends to come down to food.  Recently Harwatt and a team of scientists from Oregon State University, Bard College, and Loma Linda University calculated just what would happen if every American made one dietary change: substituting beans for beef. They found that if everyone were willing and able to do that—hypothetically—the U.S. could still come close to meeting its 2020 greenhouse-gas emission goals, pledged by President Barack Obama in 2009.  That is, even if nothing about our energy infrastructure or transportation system changed—and even if people kept eating chicken and pork and eggs and cheese—this one dietary change could achieve somewhere between 46 and 74 percent of the reductions needed to meet the target.  “I think there’s genuinely a lack of awareness about how much impact this sort of change can have,” Harwatt told me. There have been analyses in the past about the environmental impacts of veganism and vegetarianism, but this study is novel for the idea that a person’s dedication to the cause doesn’t have to be complete in order to matter. A relatively small, single-food substitution could be the most powerful change a person makes in terms of their lifetime environmental impact—more so than downsizing one’s car, or being vigilant about turning off light bulbs, and certainly more than quitting showering.  Read: The economic case for worldwide vegetarianism  To understand why the climate impact of beef alone is so large, note that the image at the top of this story is a sea of soybeans in a silo in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest. The beans belong to a feed lot that holds 38,000 cattle, the growth and fattening of which means dispensing 900 metric tons of feed every day. Which is to say that these beans will be eaten by cows, and the cows will convert the beans to meat, and the humans will eat the meat. In the process, the cows will emit much greenhouse gas, and they will consume far more calories in beans than they will yield in meat, meaning far more clearcutting of forests to farm cattle feed than would be necessary if the beans above were simply eaten by people.  This inefficient process happens on a massive scale. Brazil, the world’s largest exporter of red meat, holds around 212 million cattle. (In June, the U.S. temporarily suspended imports of beef from Brazil due to abscesses, collections of pus, in the meat.) According to the United Nations, 33 percent of arable land on Earth is used to grow feed for livestock. Even more, 26 percent of the ice-free terrestrial surface of Earth is used for grazing livestock. In all, almost a third of the land on Earth is used to produce meat and animal products.",If Everyone Ate Beans Instead of Beef,other,
3a90d9c8,"The dramatic melting of Arctic ice is already driving extreme weather that affects hundreds of millions of people across North America, Europe and Asia, leading climate scientists have told the Guardian.
Severe “snowmageddon” winters are now strongly linked to soaring polar temperatures, say researchers, with deadly summer heatwaves and torrential floods also probably linked. The scientists now fear the Arctic meltdown has kickstarted abrupt changes in the planet’s swirling atmosphere, bringing extreme weather in heavily populated areas to the boil. The northern ice cap has been shrinking since the 1970s, with global warming driving the loss of about three-quarters of its volume so far. But the recent heat in the Arctic has shocked scientists, with temperatures 33C above average in parts of the Russian Arctic and 20C higher in some other places. In November, ice levels hit a record low, and we are now in “uncharted territory”, said Prof Jennifer Francis, an Arctic climate expert at Rutgers University in the US, who first became interested in the region when she sailed through it on a round-the-world trip in the 1980s. “These rapid changes in the Arctic are affecting weather patterns where you live right now,” she said. “In the past you have had natural variations like El Niño, but they have never happened before in combination with this very warm Arctic, so it is a whole new ball game. “It is inconceivable that this ridiculously warm Arctic would not have an impact on weather patterns in the middle latitudes further south, where so many people live. “It’s safe to say [the hot Arctic] is going to have a big impact, but it’s hard to say exactly how big right now. But we are going to have a lot of very interesting weather – we’re not going to get around that one.” The area covered by Arctic sea ice at least four years old has decreased from 718,000 sq miles in September 1984 to 42,000 sq miles in September 2016. Older ice tends to be less vulnerable to melting. The age of the ice is indicated by shades ranging from blue-gray for the youngest ice to white for the oldest. Credits: Nasa The chain of events that links the melting Arctic with weather to the south begins with rising global temperatures causing more sea ice to melt. Unlike on the Antarctic continent, melting ice here exposes dark ocean beneath, which absorbs more sunlight than ice and warms further. This feedback loop is why the Arctic is heating up much faster than the rest of the planet.
This in turn narrows the temperature difference between the Arctic and lower latitudes, which is crucial because it is the temperature gradient between them that drives the jet stream wind, which streaks around the pole at up to 250mph and about 8km above the surface. The jet stream forms a boundary between the cold north and the warmer south, but the lower temperature difference means the winds are now weaker. This means the jet stream meanders more, with big loops bringing warm air to the frozen north and cold air into warmer southern climes. Furthermore, researchers say, the changes mean the loops can remain stuck over regions for weeks, rather than being blown westwards as in the past. This “blocking” effect means extreme events can unfold.
“There have been recent studies showing very plausible physical mechanisms of how rapid warming in the Arctic can influence weather in the mid latitudes, both in summer and winter,” said Dim Coumou at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. Coumou is a former offshore industry geophysicist who has studied the link between extreme weather events and global warming since 2010. “A couple of years ago this was the main criticism on any such links, that the physics was not well understood,” he said. “But the big question [now] is, how important are these mechanisms?” The other main influence on the jet stream is sea surface temperature in the tropics, which waxes and wanes with El Niño, while solar cycles and even volcanic eruptions have smaller effects. The clearest connection so far between the melting Arctic and weather is for extreme winter conditions, such as the intense winters that hit parts of North America and northern Europe in 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2013-14, causing record snowfalls and billions of dollars of damage. In those years, the jet stream deviated deeply southwards over those regions, pulling down savagely cold air. Prof Adam Scaife, a climate modelling expert at the UK’s Met Office, said the evidence for a link to shrinking Arctic ice was now good: “The consensus points towards that being a real effect.” While downswings of the jet stream can bring freezing winters, the accompanying upswings have been linked to worsening the drought in California. “These northward jet stream swings are of course the reason California is having such a terrible drought,” said Francis. This effect was in fact predicted back in 2004, with those researchers now saying: “Reality is moving faster than we thought or hoped it would.”
But the winter extremes can also swing the other way and bring mild but torrential weather, as seen in the past two winters in the UK, leading to severe flooding, said Prof Edward Hanna, at the University of Sheffield in the UK.
150 years of global warming in a minute-long symphony Guardian He pointed to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a cyclic variation in air pressure that may be affected by the fast melting of Arctic ice. The variability of the NOA has doubled in the last century, he said: “Within the last decade, there have been wild swings in the NAO values in December.” The connection between the vanishing Arctic ice and extreme summer weather in the northern hemisphere is probable, according to scientists, but not yet as certain as the winter link. Blocking patterns caused by slow-moving meanders of the jet stream have been firmly linked to some devastating events, including the 2010 summer floods in Pakistan, which killed 2,000 people and affected 20 million, and also the searing heatwave in Russia in the same year, which killed 50,000 people and wiped out $15bn (£12bn) of crops. Villagers stand outside their homes during flash floods on the outskirts of Peshawar, Pakistan, April 2016
“We also see such summer events more often in recent years,” said Coumou. Blocking events have also been linked to summer deluges in the UK, leading to disastrous flooding in 2007 and 2012 which caused billions of pounds in damage.
The year 2012 was also an extreme year for Greenland, with record melting across its entire surface flushing water into the ocean and accelerating sea level rise. The hot loop of air that sat on Greenland that year may also be linked to one of the biggest weather disasters of recent years: Hurricane Sandy, which killed 233 people and cost $75bn in damages. Scientists suspect that the blocking event over Greenland, potentially linked to the record low Arctic ice that summer, prevented the hurricane veering north-east out into the Atlantic like most storms. Instead, blocked by the high pressure, Sandy swung left over the most populated area of the east coast of the US. Damage caused by Hurricane Sandy in Rodanthe, North Carolina, October 2012
Another consequence of the fast melting Arctic raises the possibility that there may be even worse extreme weather to come, according to a few scientists: titanic Atlantic superstorms and hurricanes barreling across Europe.
The melting of Greenland ice is pouring about 250bn tonnes a year of fresh water, which is less dense than salty sea water, into the ocean. As a result, the water mass sinks less and the current that drags warm water up the Atlantic is weakened – scientists have already found that the current is at its weakest for a millennium. This means a region of the north Atlantic is becoming relatively cool and this exaggerates the contrast with tropical waters to the south, which is the driver for storms. In the worst case scenario, said the renowned climate scientist Prof James Hansen, this “will drive superstorms, stronger than any in modern times – all hell will break loose in the north Atlantic and neighbouring lands”.
Hansen– who was one of the first scientists to alert the world to the dangers of climate change in 1988 and has been arrested more than once outside the White House while protesting against fossil fuel developments – pointed to the historical record as a precedent: 118,000 years ago a superstorm tossed 1,000-tonne mega boulders on to the shores of the Bahamas.
“I would certainly not call such [superstorm] scenarios ridiculous,” said Coumou. “But it is speculative – we don’t have the hard evidence.”
But even with what is known so far, there is cause for concern that the complex interactions are turning the slow burn of global temperature rise into sudden weather disasters.
“The worrying aspect is that such dynamical changes can occur more abruptly than simple background warming of the climate,” said Coumou. “Dynamical changes can change more rapidly and can therefore lead to surprises and I think there are many such possibilities in the system.” A polar bear swims in Svalbard. The fjords there would usually be partially covered with sea ice, but last winter most of the archipelago was surrounded by open water. 
Amid the gloomy prospects, there is some cause for hope however. “A large fraction of the US public still doesn’t believe that it is humans that are affecting the climate system,” said Francis. “But one of the silver linings of this pretty dark cloud is that the Arctic is such an obvious and conspicuous change, that anybody can see them happening. There is no ambiguity whatsoever.”

The taskforce has reviewed mental health care and has set out its vision for preventative, holistic mental health care and making sure that care is always available for people experiencing a crisis.  The recommendations to be delivered by 2021 include:  an end to the practice of sending people out of their local area for acute inpatient care  providing mental health care to 70,000 more children and young people  supporting 30,000 more new and expectant mothers through maternal mental health services  new funding to ensure all acute hospitals have mental health services in emergency departments for people of all ages  increasing access to talking therapies to reach 25% of those who need this support  a commitment to reducing suicides by 10%  Responding to the report, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said:  We have made monumental strides in the way we treat mental illness in this country — but we must go even further. Our shared vision of a 7 day mental health service means people will get the care they need, when they need it, and will help prevent mental illness in the first place.  One in 4 people will experience a mental health problem and the cost of mental ill health to the economy, the NHS and society as a whole is £105 billion a year.  This announcement will accelerate the progress that has already been made, including:  increasing the money put into mental health every year since 2010, giving the NHS a record £11.7 billion last year  introducing the first ever access and waiting time standards for mental health, meaning people will get the care they need when they need it  investing £1.4 billion to transform young people’s mental health services  Alistair Burt, minister for mental health, said:",New investment in mental health services,other,

,"A shocking new study that was conducted by researchers at Canada’s University of Ottawa Heart Institute found that one out of every thousand(1/1000) mRNA Covid-19 vaccinations causes heart inflammation(myopericarditis) to develop rapidly in otherwise healthy individuals.  The study looked at over 32,000 individuals who had received either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines and monitored them for heart-related conditions between June 1, 2021, and July 31, 2021.  32 of the study subjects were admitted into the hospital with heart and chest-related symptoms.  “There were 15,997 doses of Moderna vaccine, and 16,382 doses of Pfizer vaccine administered over the study period, for a total of 32,379 doses. Note that these numbers represent a mixture of first and second doses. TRENDING: ""I Went There for You My Son"" - J6 Political Prisoner Chris Quaglin Was Brutally Beaten in Jail and Denied Celiac-Safe Food - Here Is His Heartfelt Letter to His Son on His First Birthday -- Please Donate Therefore, if our cohort captured all cases in the Ottawa area, then the incidence of myocarditis would be 0.1% of all vaccine doses (32 cases/32,379 doses x 100), or 10 cases of myocarditis for every 10,000 doses of vaccine.”  Researchers found that the symptoms show up extremely quickly after vaccination, usually after the patient’s second dose. On average, people who were affected developed the condition after just 1.5 days.  They also found that men are at a much greater risk than women – only 2 women experienced heart inflammation.  “32 patients were identified over the period of interest. Eighteen patients were diagnosed with myocarditis; 12 with myopericarditis; and 2 with pericarditis alone. The median age was 33 years (18-65 years). The sex ratio was 2 females to 29 males. In 5 cases, symptoms developed after only a single dose of mRNA vaccine. In 27 patients, symptoms developed after their second dose of. Median time between vaccine dose and symptoms was 1.5 days (1-26 days).”  People who took the Moderna jab were 3x more likely to develop symptoms than those who took the Pfizer shot.  To date, this has been the largest case study that has looked at the correlation between Covid mRNA vaccines and myocarditis symptoms within a month of vaccination.  If the results are true, it would actually be more of a risk for anyone under 65 to receive the shot than it would be to contract the virus and recover, especially depending on how young they are. Myocarditis and pericarditis both come with an extremely poor prognosis and end up killing over 50% within 3-10 years of their diagnosis.  According to the most recent data, Americans under 65 have about a 1 in 1863 (Population – 273,820,000 / Total Covid deaths – 146,991) or .00054 chance of dying from Covid-19 or .054%. If you lower the age to 50 and under, the chance that Covid is fatal drops precipitously to .00017 or 1 in 5841 or .o17%.  In other words, the chances that covid will kill you if you are under 50 are almost 6x lower than the chances you will develop a debilitating (and often fatal in the long run) heart condition.  Even more shocking – people under 40 who take the jab are almost 13.5 times more likely to develop some form of myocarditis or pericarditis than to be killed by Covid. Keep in mind the median age from this study was 33.  Meanwhile, Joe Biden and the tyrannical health regime double down on their goal to get “every American” vaccinated by cramming down a new dictatorial federal mandate with a third experimental ‘booster’ jab being prepared for a massive rollout.  The Covid-19 vaccine has been so ‘effective’ in ‘protecting’ people that the masses will now be pressured into taking another dose as new outbreaks of the virus have forced a new wave of authoritarian restrictions.  Every single American has known for months where to go and how to get a vaccine if they wanted one. In fact, over 181 million eligible citizens have been fully vaccinated in the US – If the virus was as deadly as they are making it out to be, they wouldn’t have to mandate people to take the vaccine; and on the other end, if the vaccines provided the protection they’re supposed to provide, the vaccinated wouldn’t be calling people killers because they are refusing to ‘protect others.’  Besides, according to available data, a third of the entire US population had contracted Covid BY THE END OF 2020. Natural immunity has always proven to be superior to vaccines.  A recent study that was conducted in Israel on 800,000 individuals confirms that is especially the case with the rushed mRNA Covid vaccines.  They found that individuals who had received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were 13x more likely to contract Covid-19 than those who had natural immunity – Fully vaccinated people were also found to be at a “GREATER RISK OF HOSPITALIZATION.”  If 1/3rd of Americans had already contracted the virus – before it had even been known for a full year – then why would “everyone” be forced to take the experimental vaccine?

,"When it comes to actions taken to address the Covid-19 threat, hindsight is still very much underway. For your consideration: a story and outcome you probably aren't hearing much about anywhere else. It takes place in the heart of Amish country.  Lancaster County, Pennsylvania: thousands of families lead lives largely separate from modern America.  The Amish are a Christian group that emphasizes the virtuous over the superficial. They don’t usually drive, use electricity, or have TVs. And during the Covid-19 outbreak, they became subjects in a massive social and medical experiment.  Sharyl: So, it's safe to say there was a whole different approach here in this community when coronavirus broke out than many other places?  Calvin Lapp: Absolutely.  Calvin Lapp is Amish Mennonite.  Lapp: There’s three things the Amish don't like. And that's government— they won't get involved in the government, they don't like the public education system— they won't send their children to education, and they also don't like the health system. They rip us off. Those are three things that we feel like we're fighting against all the time. Well, those three things are all part of what Covid is.  After a short shutdown last year, the Amish chose a unique path that led to Covid-19 tearing through at warp speed. It began with an important religious holiday in May.  Lapp: When they take communion, they dump their wine into a cup and they take turns to drink out of that cup. So, you go the whole way down the line, and everybody drinks out of that cup, if one person has coronavirus, the rest of church is going to get coronavirus. The first time they went back to church, everybody got coronavirus.  Lapp says they weren’t denying coronavirus, they were facing it head on.  Lapp: It’s a worse thing to quit working than dying. Working is more important than dying. But to shut down and say that we can't go to church, we can't get together with family, we can't see our old people in the hospital, we got to quit working? It's going completely against everything that we believe. You're changing our culture completely to try to act like they wanted us to act the last year, and we're not going to do it.  Steve Nolt is a scholar on Amish and Mennonite culture, and Mennonite himself. He’s studying Amish news publications to analyze community-wide trends.  Sharyl: So, are you saying, as of about May of 2020, things kind of went back to normal in the Amish community?  Steve Nolt: For the most part, yeah, by the middle of May, it's sort of like back to a typical behavior again.  That also meant avoiding hospitals.  Nolt: I know of some cases in which Amish people refused to go to the hospital, even when they were very sick because if they went there, they wouldn't be able to have visitors. And it was more important to be sick, even very sick at home and have the ability to have some people around you than to go to the hospital and be isolated.  Then, last March, remarkable news. The Lancaster County Amish were reported to be the first community to achieve “herd immunity,” meaning a large part of a population had been infected with Covid-19 and became immune.  Some outsiders are skeptical, and solid proof is hard to come by.  Nolt: Even those who believed that they had Covid tended not to get tested. Their approach tended to be, “I'm sick. I know I'm sick. I don't have to have someone else telling me I'm sick.” Or a concern that if they got a positive test, they would then be asked to really dramatically limit what they were doing in a way that might be uncomfortable for them. So, we don't have that testing number.  Lapp: We didn't want the numbers to go up, because then they would shut things more. What's the advantage of getting a test?  One thing’s clear: there's no evidence of any more deaths among the Amish than in places that shut down tight— some claim there were fewer here. That’s without masking, staying at home, or another important measure.  Sharyl: Did most of the community, at least the adults, get the Covid-19 vaccine?  Nolt: Again, we don't have data on that, but I think it's pretty clear that in percentage terms, relatively few did.  Lapp: Oh, we're glad all the English people got their Covid vaccines. That's great. Because now we don't have to wear a mask, we can do what we want. So good for you. Thank you. We appreciate it. Us? No, we're not getting vaccines. Of course not. We all got the Covid, so why would you get a vaccine?  By staying open, the Amish here have one tangible 2020 accomplishment few others can claim.  Lapp: We have this joke: when everybody else started walking, we started running. We made more money in the last year than we ever did. It was our best year ever.  Did the Amish really find a magic formula? They say yes. And they don’t care who doubts it.  Lapp: Yeah, all the Amish know we got herd immunity. Of course we got herd immunity! The whole church gets coronavirus. We know we got coronavirus. We think we’re smarter than everybody. We shouldn’t be bragging, but we think we did the right thing.  Sharyl (on-camera): Nolt, the scholar, is publishing a paper on the Amish social response to government mandates and Covid-19.",Amish Covid,other,257142174031913257178169900421852852669
,"According to a new study of tech companies that made pledges to support the black lives matter movement, those companies actually employed fewer black employees on average than companies that didn’t take any public stance. That comes despite the supporting companies making a combined $4.6 billion in financial commitments to the cause.  As Bloomberg reports:  A new study of diversity in the technology industry found companies that made statements of solidarity had 20% fewer Black employees on average than those that didn’t. The finding highlights a gap between what companies say about social issues and what they do in their own workplaces, said Stephanie Lampkin, the founder and chief executive officer of Blendoor, which conducted the study.  Obviously no company should be hiring specifically because one belongs to a particular demographic over skill, but it is amusing an amusing juxtaposition nonetheless.  Corporations pretending to take political stances for the purpose of promoting a public image of themselves is nothing new. We saw this when companies like Apple, Nike, and Coca-Cola all came out with their “principled stands against injustice” in opposing common sense voter integrity laws in George – as they were lobbying against a bill that would bar U.S. companies from relying on forced Uighur labor in China.  This is nothing new either. Decades ago, in response to businesses capitalizing off of climate change hysteria there was even a term coined to describe the practice of companies deceptively marketing themselves as “green” and “environmentally friendly” solely to boost business: greenwashing.  Woke capitalism is on the rise, and it won’t go away until everyone wakes up to the blatantly obvious fact that it’s just a marketing campaign.

,"Listen 0:00 BOSPUB-1.mp3  Earlier this month, 47 democrats in the house of representatives defied a house veto threat by backing a GOP bill to ramp up screening requirements for Syrian and Iraqi refugees. Congressman Stephen Lynch was among them. He joined Jim Braude and Margery Eagan on Boston Public Radio to discuss the reasoning behind his vote and other congressional matters.  Questions are paraphrased, and responses are edited where noted [...].  MARGERY: Let’s start with the vote on the Syrian refugees. Why were you with those 47 other democrats?  It’s a very simple bill, I know that it’s got subsumed within a larger discussion about immigration policy, but basically, the bill we voted on was a very short bill—four pages in length, basically, and it said that the director of national security shall review the vetting process as being conducted by both the FBI and the department of homeland security. Because of the disastrous results we’ve had so far with the screening process, especially the department of homeland security, I think it was a very good idea to have another set of eyeballs looking at that process.  Back in August, we did an investigation—the inspector General did—of the Department of Homeland Security, and they had 72 individuals that were on the terrorist watch list that were actually working at the Department of Homeland Security. The director had to resign because of that. Then we went further and did and eight-airport investigation. We had staffers go into eight different airports to test the department of homeland security screening process at major airports. They had a 95 percent failure rate. We had folks—this was a testing exercise, so we had folks going in there with guns on their ankles, and other weapons on their persons, and there was a 95 percent failure rate.  I have very low confidence based on empirical data that we’ve got on the Department of Homeland Security. I think we desperately need another set of eyeballs looking at the vetting process. That’s vetting that’s being done at major airports where we have a stationary person coming through a facility, and we’re failing 95 percent of the time. I have even lower confidence that they can conduct the vetting process in places like Jordan, or Belize or on the Syrian border, or in Cairo, or Beirut in any better fashion, especially given the huge volume of applicants we’ve had seeking refugee status.  JIM: Even if you’re right that the system needs strengthening, the most likely way that a terrorist would come into this country is not through an 18-24 month-long process, but through this Visa program that allows 20 million people from 38 countries to come here every single year with absolutely no prior approval at all.  We had Democratic and Republican proposals on this bill, and there wasn’t a dime’s worth of difference between the two of them. It became a sort of a proxy battle over immigration. You had a bunch of Republican governors who were using it politically, and saying, “we’re going to stop refugees from coming into our state, which is baloney because they have no ability—zero ability—under the constitution to actually prevent refugees from coming into their state. You also had other people on the far left saying that this would stop every person from coming into the United States. In both cases, if they only took the time to read the bill, they would see that it did not do either. The democratic proposal also requires a multi-layered vetting process of refugees.  The reason the refugee issue came up and not the Visa waiver program is because in the Paris example, you had somebody go into the stream of legitimate refugees and then perpetrate acts of violence upon the civilians in Paris. That’s why that example came to the forefront.  I agree with you—I think the Visa waiver program, where you’ve got 20 million people coming in, versus the [refugees] coming in, 10,000? perhaps? At the end of the day, obviously the Visa waiver program is the one that we should be looking at.  JIM: Governor Charlie Baker was one of those governors who hesitated about refugees coming to Massachusetts—he didn’t sign the letter that Republican governors sent to the president, but he did state that he wanted a pause on the whole refugee thing. Was he grandstanding in your opinion?  I don’t think he was. If you listen to his press conference, when he addressed it, I thought his remarks were very thoughtful, and I thought his remarks were very measured, compared to what you heard from some of the red state governors that were doing a lot of the chest bumping and that sort of thing. Governor Baker was asking for more information, which I think was totally appropriate.  MARGERY: You just mentioned the TSA’s terrible record. You mentioned having low confidence in the Department of Homeland Security… is it every man for himself every time you get in an airplane?  I think that they… The resources are being spent, I think there are a bunch of different weaknesses in our system, I think we have very low-paid TSA and DHS workers, I think there’s a huge turnover there, when you talk to the people at the airport who are actually working there. When Bush created this system, I think it was 700,000 employees, he basically stripped away their right to join a union. They’re trying to use low-wage employees there, I heard from a TSA employee last week who was leaving, and he said there’s just no room for advancement there, they’re just stuck. I think morale is part of it, and the whole screening process is being revisited now after the inspector general’s report.  MARGERY: If Homeland Security is so inept, but we depend on them, should we be much more scared than we are? Should the focus be to better train DHS employees?  Absolutely...we had a hearing three weeks ago where the new TSA director said that they’re going back to the drawing board, and beginning again in terms of what their approach is. That’s a good thing. It’s a little bit late in coming, but I think because of what happened in Paris and what happened in Egypt with the airliner, what happened in Beirut… We’re redoubling our efforts, but obviously the system that was initially put in place was inadequate.

,"In an attempt to reduce violent crime, San Francisco, California, will launch a program that will pay people $300 a month if they don’t shoot someone.  Fox News reported that the program, called Dream Keeper Fellowship, “will pay 10 individuals who are at high risk of being on either end of a shooting $300 each month to not be involved in such crimes.” This means that people at high risk of being shot also qualify for the program, though it’s unclear how the determination is made. The program will launch in October.  Sheryl Davis, executive director of the Human Rights Commission, told Newsweek that the program is not “transactional,” as it may seem.  “It’s not necessarily as cut and dry as folks may think. It’s not as transactional as, ‘Here’s a few dollars so that you don’t do something bad,’ but it really is about how you help us improve public safety in the neighborhood,” she told the outlet.  From Newsweek:  Participants will be paired with life coaches from the city’s Street Violence Intervention Program and will be considered “community ambassadors” who work to prevent violence. They will work on their professional, personal, and community development and will be thought of as “partners” in engaging community members and decreasing violence.  Davis said the program will attempt to find the “root causes” of violence, which she said in “so many ways are economic.”  This sentiment was echoed by San Francisco Mayor London Breed.  “In many cases, sadly, the common denominator is that these folks do not have any sort of income. And so part of what we’re trying to do is make sure that money is not a barrier to turning your life around,” Breed said, according to The Telegraph.  Participants in the program can earn even more money by getting a job, going to school, or even mediating situations that may lead to violence. In other words, the program will pay people to do things they should be doing anyway. What happens if and when that money stops? Will the people continue to work or follow the law? Will they need to be paid this way forever?  Newsweek reported that the program in San Francisco is based on a similar one in Richmond, California, which the American Journal of Public Health said helped reduce gun homicide by 55%. That claim is so odd that even left-wing Mother Jones questioned whether paying people not to shoot others actually reduced crime or whether the city just got lucky.  The Washington Examiner’s David Freddoso noted that a similar program was also tried in Sacramento, “where its promoters boast that ‘only’ 44% of participants were subsequently arrested on new charges — well, as long as you don’t count about one-third of the participants who dropped out or were arrested in its first six months.”  Activist and Reverend Eugene Rivers, another critic of the program, told Fox News that the program was a “gimmick.”  “You do not get young people to turn from crime by generating gimmicks. This is a policy gimmick,” he said. “It’s a bad idea, it’s not a new idea and for many people it’ll be Christmas in September or October.”  The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky stated Friday that Russian forces are firing at “military installations” leaving analysts speculating that term could include US-installed and operated bio-labs.  According to US government documents, the US has multiple biolabs in Ukraine. In typical Pentagon fashion, these biolabs are marketed as “defense.“  Russia has been warning the US for months to stop operating dangerous biolabs on their doorstep. Mainstream media won’t touch the topic now, but they did cover the news in the past.  Four months ago, Russia and China asked the UN for the US to be “checked and limited” in biological capabilities.  Russia and China blamed the US for the Covid-19 outbreak and were fearful that the US had more bioweapons to be unleashed on the world.  How does this relate to Ukraine?  Putin has admitted he is engaged in a “special military operation” to demilitarize Ukraine. Mainstream analysts fail to understand the possible scope of this statement.

,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!  Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said Thursday it was ""absolutely the government's business"" to know which Americans haven't been vaccinated yet against the coronavirus.  Responding to GOP criticisms of the Biden administration's planned ""door-to-door"" campaign to encourage unvaccinated Americans to inoculate themselves, Becerra told CNN the government has had to ""spend trillions of dollars to try to keep Americans alive during this pandemic.""  ""So it is absolutely the government's business, it is taxpayers' business, if we have to continue to spend money to try to keep people from contracting COVID and helping reopen the economy,"" he said.  FAUCI'S ‘GET OVER THIS POLITICAL STATEMENT’ COMMENT ON VACCINES GETS PANNED  Becerra said people didn't have to answer the door but he hoped they would so officials could dispel rumors about the vaccine, which has proven to be highly effective in driving down cases, hospitalizations and deaths. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 56% of the adult population has been ""fully vaccinated"" and 67% has gotten at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine.  States that tend to vote Republican have reported lower vaccination rates, and polls show Republican voters are far more likely than Democrats to say they will not or likely will not get the vaccine. The issue has become part of a larger debate over public health measures colliding with Americans' personal freedoms.  Citing concerns over the ""Delta variant"" of the virus, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said this week the door-to-door push is designed to inform people in less vaccinated pockets of the country about where to get the shot and address their concerns about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, she said, adding that it's not up to the federal government to mandate vaccines.  WHITE HOUSE DEFENDS DOOR-TO-DOOR VACCINATION PUSH AMID BACKLASH  Asked by anchor Brianna Keilar if the administration was considering more aggressive measures to get more people vaccinated, Becerra hedged, saying he wanted people to have ""as much freedom and choice as possible.""  ""We want to give people the sense that they have the freedom to choose. But we hope they choose to live,"" Becerra said. ""We hope people make the right choices. We want them to have the right information, but we are America.

,"President Biden appeared to forget the name of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday night while unveiling a key nuclear submarine pact — calling him “pal” and “that fella Down Under.”  The 78-year-old commander-in-chief — notorious for his flubs — was flanked by Morrison and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on giant screens as they unveiled the new AUKUS military alliance.  “Thank you, Boris, and I want to thank, er … that fella Down Under,” Biden said after a pause while turning toward the screen with Morrison, who’d already spoken.  “Thank you very much, pal. Appreciate it, Mr. Prime Minister,” he said, getting a thumbs up from Morrison, whom he called one of America’s “closest allies.”  While Biden did eventually address “Prime Minister Morrison” during his pre-written speech, the latest apparent flub was picked up by Australian media — and quickly lit up Twitter.  “‘The fella down under’ has a name. How embarrassing,” a Brit named Dom M replied to Biden’s tweeted link of the press conference video.  Biden did eventually address Prime Minister Morrison by his actual name. TOLGA AKMEN/AFP via Getty Images  “Just a public speaking tip – if you’re going to mention someone by name WRITE IT DOWN,” someone named Meegan also tweeted Biden.  “HOW DID YOU NOT REMEMBER THE PRIME MINISTERS NAME. ‘That fella down under…thank you pal’ was honestly so embarrassing.”  “I don’t understand how Americans vote for him,” an Australian named Adam tweeted, noting how Biden always seems “very forgetful.”    Some Aussies who are not fans of their prime minister, however, seemed to revel in the apparent slip-up, saying it made their day.  “Cut him some slack.

,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!  San Francisco is rolling out a pilot program that will pay high-risk individuals to not shoot anyone as gun crimes tick up in the city.  ""These small investments can transform the lives of individuals, but they can also transform communities,"" Sheryl Davis, executive director of the Human Rights Commission, told Newsweek .  The Dream Keeper Fellowship will pay 10 individuals who are at high risk of being on either end of a shooting $300 each month to not be involved in such crimes.  CALIFORNIA LOOKING INTO PAYING DRUG ADDICTS TO STAY SOBER  The fellowship is being rolled out by the Human Rights Commission and Office of Economic and Workforce Development and is funded through the Dream Keeper Initiative, which is San Francisco’s program that works to redirect funding into the Black community. It will launch in October.  ""It's not necessarily as cut and dry as folks may think. It's not as transactional as, 'Here's a few dollars so that you don't do something bad,' but it really is about how you help us improve public safety in the neighborhood,"" Davis added.  Participants of the program will be paired with life coaches from the city's Street Violence Intervention Program and will serve as ""community ambassadors."" Participants are also eligible to receive an additional $200 per month through ways such as, working, going to school or being a mediator in potentially violent situations.  Payments are made in the form of gift cards and will be monitored, the San Francisco Examiner reported.  ""As you become better, your community benefits from that,"" Davis said.  Mayor London Breed previously spoke approvingly of the idea as one that could cut down on violence in the city.  ""My desire is to get to them, not to just make an arrest, but to get to them and to try and figure out if they would be willing to work with us on something that is an alternative,"" Breed said at a Violence Prevention Summit hosted by the Human Rights Commission in August. ""We can’t just put them in a program without making sure that they have money, without making sure that they have something to take care of themselves.""  Shootings have spiked in the city this year, with 119 recorded gun crime victims in the first half of the year, which is double the number during the same timeframe in 2020.  The program follows a similar one in Richmond, California, which was dubbed ""cash for criminals"" by the media after gun crimes increased. A 2019 study credited the program with helping reduce gun homicides in the city by 55%.  Critics of the program have pointed out that similar initiatives haven't been very successful, with the Washington Examiner's David Freddoso saying in a Wednesday op-ed, ""It was also tried in Sacramento, where its promoters boast that ‘only’ 44% of participants were subsequently arrested on new charges — well, as long as you don't count about one-third of the participants who dropped out or were arrested in its first six months.

,"Dr. Vladimir Zelenko became a hero for his early use of hydroxychloroquine to fight COVID. Sadly, his efforts were halted by a Democrat governor. But Dr. Zelenko didn’t stop. He kept working — and found an over-the-counter way to help people. TRENDING: ""For the First Time We Were All Able to Sing the Star-Spangled Banner Together, We Sang it Loud and Proud"" - Exclusive: Patriots Speak Out from the Inside of DC ""GITMO"" - One Year After January 6 Watch: Here is Dr. Zelenko talk about “the bullet and gun” approach for understanding zinc ionophores (transcript of highlights is below): Dr Zelenko: The Gun & The Bullet, Breaking Down The Protocol And Immune Support Here is a transcript of highlights from the video: Dr. Zelenko: “Zinc is the bullet – it kills the virus. The only problem is the bullet doesn’t get to the place where it needs to be. The virus is inside the cell. The enzyme is inside the cell. And the zinc on its own cannot get into the cell. You have a bullet without a gun – useless. Now, it turns out there’s a class of medications called ‘zinc ionophores’ or a class of substances called ‘zinc ionophores’ — what they do — is they open up a channel, a door, which allows zinc to go from outside the cell to inside the cell. There are four of them that are readily available – two of them are prescription and two of them are over-the-counter. The two prescription ones everyone has heard of: Hydroxycholorquine and Ivermection. They’re the guns that shoot the bullet. The bullet then gets into the cell and stops the virus enzyme from helping the virus replicate. So you have a gun and bullet. Only the synergy of the two creates a functioning unit. S in april of last year, Cuomo issued an executive order that was directly targeting me and my patients – because I was the only one in the state doing it. Where pharmacies would not dispense hydroxychloroquine to patients. So all of a sudden, I had a gun and a bullet approach, but…he took away the zinc delivery system — at least he took away access to my patients. So I was forced by necessity to innovate. I did more research, and on the NIH servers of all places, I found papers saying a substance called quercetin is a zinc delivery system, as well. It’s a zinc ionophore. To be honest, I’d never heard of quercetin. So I googled it and I see it’s over-the-counter. That was one of the most significant realizations in my life and probably in humanity. Why do I say that? Because now there was a cure for tyranny. There are two risk factors for dying from COVID: It’s the doctor you choose and the government you live under. Besides that, there’s no reason a person should die from COVID. Now, you don’t need a doctor and now you don’t need permission from the government. You can go to a pharmacy or go to a supermarket and buy an over-the-counter option of quercetin together with Zinc and Vitamin C and Vitamin D. Together it creates a very powerful immune-boosting nutritional supplement. According to the FDA, I’m not allowed to make any claims except that it’s an immune booster and nutritional supplement. So what I’m going to say is the following: Quercetin and Vitamin C together form a functioning zinc ionophore — a zinc delivery system. Zinc is what it delivers, so you actually need zinc as well. You need the gun and the bullet. And Vitamin D – the studies all show – Vitamin D3 levels between 50 and 70 virtually eliminate hospitalizations or admissions in the intensive care unit. It optimizes their immune system..so you need Vitamin D, then you need Zinc, which is the bullet. And then to form a functioning gun, you need Vitamin C and quercetin… Patients were having trouble sourcing it, because it was four different ingredients that weren’t always available in the same place. They had trouble finding the right doses. It was a puzzle that was a little too complex for people to put together. So I was asked as a necessity — as a favor to people — to produce something that has everything in one package. It made sense to me, so with the help of my colleagues, we were able to produce a substance — a compound called Z-Stack — that has Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and most importantly has quercetin and zinc.” Now, Dr. Zelenko is now making Z-Stack available to everyone.

,"A new study from Johns Hopkins on natural immunity to COVID-19 might prove Anthony Fauci's worst nightmare. ""If you had a positive COVID test in the past, then you had a 99.3 percent chance of having circulating antibodies against COVID, and those antibodies were present up to 20 months, nearly two years after the infection,"" explained Dr. Marty Makary on ""Washington Watch."" The antibodies could last longer, but ""that's as long as the infection has been around."" For millions of Americans who have recovered from COVID-19, this is good news. But there couldn't be worse news for Dr. Fauci, or as some believe him to be, Science Incarnate. Since early in the pandemic, the National Institutes of Health have discounted natural immunity because, they said, its duration was unknown. That's the public health equivalent of recommending soldiers not carry guns into combat because they might jam unpredictably. Over a year later, the federally-backed funding behemoth still has never bothered to study the question. ""Why am I doing this study,"" asked Makary, a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine & School of Public Health, ""when the NIH has $42 billion and could have done this study instantly?"" He suggested the answer is, ""they don't want to know the results."" The conclusions of the Johns Hopkins study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, are far from ""fringe."" Israeli data have shown natural immunity to be 27 times more protective than vaccines, but Mr. Science ignored that data, preferring instead to extrapolate a policy decision from other Israeli data, released around the same time, which showed booster shots could reduce the risk of hospitalization for older people. ""You cannot cherry pick the science,"" Makary protested. Makary is concerned with the exclusive club of medical experts who are both advising the Biden administration on policy and controlling the purse strings for scientific grants to allow others to conduct research. ""They just talk among themselves,"" he said. A FOIA request has revealed that in October 2020, Fauci colluded with NIH Director Francis Collins to discredit with ""a quick and devastating published take down"" Stanford epidemiologist Jay Bhattacharya and other authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, who advocated for natural immunity and targeted protection for vulnerable groups. Fauci's ilk ""are living in their own bubble,"" Makary said. ""They're not even thinking about an exit of the pandemic."" To determine U.S. policy on natural immunity, they held a ""small vote among some of their experts... The vote was split, and they decided not to recognize it."" Note that this split vote was the ""scientific consensus"" with which dissenting opinions were so ruthlessly de-platformed, ridiculed, and cancelled in the early months of lockdowns. The self-proclaimed experts knew that Americans wouldn't tolerate lockdowns if their flimsy scientific basis was widely known. ""This should not be an oligarchy,"" argued Makary. ""This should be an open scientific debate."" ""The science is now heavily curated,"" continued Makary. ""The CDC's own study on natural immunity... showed natural immunity was three times more protective [against hospitalization] than vaccinated immunity."" But that's not what their conclusion said. They wrote that ""vaccination is still the safest strategy. But that's not what the data show,"" he said. ""Ten to 20 percent of the U.S. population gets infected with a respiratory infection every year, and has for centuries,"" he concluded.

,"In July 2021, the Indonesian Food and Drug Monitoring Agency (BPOM) finally granted the Emergency Use Authorization for Ivermectin as the therapeutic drug to cure the Covid-19. This was due to the country’s “worst-case scenario” epidemic at the time according to officials. Indonesia experienced a spike in COVID-19 infection and deaths in July and was struggling to slow the virus transmission due to its high population.  Indonesia is ranked as the world’s fourth most populous country. The Indonesian government on Thursday (July 15) began distributing free medicine and vitamins to self-isolating Covid-19 patients in high-risk areas as the highly transmissible Delta variant of the coronavirus continued to rip through the country, emptying pharmacy shelves. Each package will have seven days worth of therapeutic Covid-19 drugs and vitamins, and will be given to asymptomatic patients as well as those with mild to moderate symptoms including fever and dry cough. The medication for the latter group will require consultation with a doctor and a prescription. Medical facilities are stretched thin, and demand for oxygen and medication has also soared. As scores of people are isolating themselves at home and self-medicating, prices of drugs have shot up in pharmacies and online. The health ministry has since moved to cap the prices of drugs such as favipiravir, remdesivir and ivermectin. Indonesia’s food and drug agency has authorised ivermectin for emergency use against Covid-19, Reuters reported, although the World Health Organisation, as well as European and the US regulators did not recommend its use for Covid-19 patients. After the government authorized the use of Ivermectin for COVID-19 patients, the number of cases significantly plummeted since July. As of October 8, only 20.5% were fully vaccinated and 35.9% got their first dose.

,"The Defender is experiencing censorship on many social channels. Be sure to stay in touch with the news that matters by subscribing to our top news of the day. It's free. A groundbreaking preprint paper by the prestigious Oxford University Clinical Research Group, published Aug. 10 in The Lancet, includes alarming findings devastating to the COVID vaccine rollout. The study found vaccinated individuals carry 251 times the load of COVID-19 viruses in their nostrils compared to the unvaccinated. While moderating the symptoms of infection, the jab allows vaccinated individuals to carry unusually high viral loads without becoming ill at first, potentially transforming them into presymptomatic superspreaders. This phenomenon may be the source of the shocking post-vaccination surges in heavily vaccinated populations globally. The paper’s authors, Chau et al, demonstrated widespread vaccine failure and transmission under tightly controlled circumstances in a hospital lockdown in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam. ORDER TODAY: Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s New Book — 'The Real Anthony Fauci' The scientists studied healthcare workers who were unable to leave the hospital for two weeks. The data showed that fully vaccinated workers — about two months after injection with the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (AZD1222) — acquired, carried and presumably transmitted the Delta variant to their vaccinated colleagues. They almost certainly also passed the Delta infection to susceptible unvaccinated people, including their patients. Sequencing of strains confirmed the workers transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to one another. This is consistent with the observations in the U.S. from Farinholt and colleagues, and congruent with comments by the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conceding COVID-19 vaccines have failed to stop transmission of SARS-CoV-2. On Feb. 11, the World Health Organization indicated the AZD1222 vaccine efficacy of 63.09% against the development of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. The conclusions of the Chau paper support the warnings by leading medical experts that the partial, non-sterilizing immunity from the three notoriously “leaky” COVID-19 vaccines allow carriage of 251 times the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to samples from the pre-vaccination era in 2020. Thus, we have a key piece to the puzzle explaining why the Delta outbreak is so formidable — fully vaccinated are participating as COVID-19 patients and acting as powerful Typhoid Mary-style super-spreaders of the infection. Vaccinated individuals are blasting out concentrated viral explosions into their communities and fueling new COVID surges. Vaccinated healthcare workers are almost certainly infecting their coworkers and patients, causing horrendous collateral damage. Continued vaccination will only make this problem worse, particularly among frontline doctors and nurses workers who are caring for vulnerable patients. Health systems should drop vaccine mandates immediately, take stock of COVID-19 recovered workers who are robustly immune to Delta and consider the ramifications of their current vaccinated healthcare workers as potential threats to high risk patients and coworkers.","Study: Fully Vaccinated Healthcare Workers Carry 251 Times Viral Load, Pose Threat to Unvaccinated Patients, Co-Workers",other,52451641498368556684630537978533941612

The study is currently available on the medRxiv* preprint server.Background In the United States, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided emergency use authorization for two mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, which have shown high efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease in clinical trials. However, the ability to vaccinate a large part of the global population is limited by vaccine supply. In order to ensure fair access to vaccines throughout the world, the COVID-19 vaccines Global Access (COVAX) initiative was launched. In many countries, especially those with low socioeconomic status, there is a serious shortage of vaccines. Thus, in order to get the maximum vaccine benefits, the most vulnerable population should be prioritized for the vaccination. Currently, most countries prioritize vaccination for healthcare and other frontline workers, elderly people, and people with comorbidities. To further narrow down the prioritization criteria, the scientists in the current study have evaluated the necessity of COVID-19 vaccines for individuals who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Study design The study was conducted on 52,238 employees in the Cleveland Clinic. A positive RT-PCR test was considered to define SARS-CoV-2 infection. The participants received two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at an interval of 28 days. A participant was considered vaccinated after 14 days of receiving the 2nd vaccine dose. Similarly, a participant who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days before the vaccination initiation was considered previously infected. Important observations Of all enrolled participants, 5% had previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared to 59% of non-infected participants, only 47% of previously infected participants were vaccinated by the end of the study. About 63% of all vaccinated participants received the Moderna vaccine. The analysis of cumulative COVID-19 incidence revealed that during the course of the study, SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred almost exclusively in participants who were not previously infected and were not vaccinated. Interestingly, no significant difference in COVID-19 incidence was observed between previously infected and currently unvaccinated participants, previously infected and currently vaccinated participants, and previously uninfected and currently vaccinated participants. The participants from these three groups exhibited a significantly lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to previously uninfected and currently unvaccinated participants. Specifically, of all infections during the study period, 99.3% occurred in participants who were not infected previously and remained unvaccinated. In contrast, only 0.7% of infections occurred in participants who were not previously infected but were currently vaccinated. Importantly, not a single incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed in previously infected participants with or without vaccination.With further statistical analysis, it was observed that the COVID-19 vaccination significantly reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in previously uninfected participants but not in previously infected participants. Although the study did not directly estimate the duration of protection from natural infection, it was observed that previously infected participants remained protected against COVID-19 for at least 10 months after the symptom onset or a positive test result. Study significance The study findings reveal that individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 are less likely to get additional benefits from vaccination. In contrast, individuals without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection can get the maximum benefits from vaccination. Thus, based on the study findings, COVID-19 vaccines should be prioritized to naïve individuals without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",No point vaccinating those who’ve had COVID-19: Findings of Cleveland Clinic study,other,187739560558252213684619819087745175611
,"The Italian Higher Institute of Health has drastically reduced the country’s official COVID death toll number by over 97 per cent after changing the definition of a fatality to someone who died from COVID rather than with COVID. Italian newspaper Il Tempo reports that the Institute has revised downward the number of people who have died from COVID rather than with COVID from 130,000 to under 4,000. “Yes, you read that right. Turns out 97.1% of deaths hitherto attributed to Covid were not due directly to Covid,” writes Toby Young. Of the of the 130,468 deaths registered as official COVID deaths since the start of the pandemic, only 3,783 are directly attributable to the virus alone. “All the other Italians who lost their lives had from between one and five pre-existing diseases. Of those aged over 67 who died, 7% had more than three co-morbidities, and 18% at least two,” writes Young. “According to the Institute, 65.8% of Italians who died after being infected with Covid were ill with arterial hypertension (high blood pressure), 23.5% had dementia, 29.3% had diabetes, and 24.8% atrial fibrillation. Add to that, 17.4% had lung problems, 16.3% had had cancer in the last five years and 15.7% suffered from previous heart failures.” The Institute’s new definition of a COVID death means that COVID has killed fewer people in Italy than (whisper it) the average bout of seasonal flu. If a similar change were made by other national governments, the official COVID death toll would be cut by a margin of greater than 90 per cent. Don’t expect many others to follow suit though, given that governments have invested so much of their authority in hyping the the threat posed by the virus. For example, behavioral psychologists in the UK worked with the state to deliberately “exaggerate” the threat of COVID via “unethical” and “totalitarian” methods of propaganda in order to terrify the public into mass compliance. And it worked. A survey conducted after the first lockdown found that the average Brit thought 100 times more people had died from COVID than the official death toll. Now we come to understand that the official killed ‘by COVID’ and not ‘with COVID’ figure is less than one tenth what is officially reported as the total COVID death toll. Despite the change, Italy may yet take the decision to make the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory, although how such a scheme would be imposed remains unspecified.",Italian Institute of Health Drastically Reduces Its Official COVID Death Toll Number,other,260665074861093710074256088143261859203
,"A funny thing happened this afternoon. Not funny as in “haha”. More like funny as in, “ohhhhh that’s how the FDA rigs the process.” I was reading the CDC’s “Guidance for Health Economics Studies Presented to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), 2019 Update” and I realized that the FDA’s woeful risk-benefit analysis in connection with Pfizer’s EUA application to jab children ages 5 to 11 violates many of the principles of the CDC’s Guidance document. The CDC “Guidance” document describes 21 things that every health economics study in connection with vaccines must do and the FDA risk-benefit analysis violated at least half of them. Today I want to focus on a single factor: the Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNTV). In four separate places the CDC Guidance document mentions the importance of coming up with a Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNTV). I did not recall seeing an NNTV in the FDA risk-benefit document. So I checked the FDA’s risk-benefit analysis again and sure enough, there was no mention of an NNTV. Because the FDA failed to provide an NNTV, I will attempt to provide it here. First a little background. The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) in order to prevent a single case, hospitalization, ICU admission, or death, is a standard way to measure the effectiveness of any drug. It’s an important tool because it enables policymakers to evaluate tradeoffs between a new drug, a different existing drug, or doing nothing. In vaccine research the equivalent term is Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNTV, sometimes also written as NNV) in order to prevent a single case, hospitalization, ICU admission, or death (those are 4 different NNTVs that one could calculate). Pharma HATES talking about NNTV and they hate talking about NNTV even more when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines because the NNTV is so ridiculously high that this vaccine could not pass any honest risk-benefit analysis. Indeed about a year ago I innocently asked on Twitter what the NNTV is for coronavirus vaccines. Pharma sent a swarm of trolls in to attack me and Pharma goons published hits pieces on me outside of Twitter to punish me for even asking the question. Of course none of the Pharma trolls provided an estimate of the NNTV for COVID-19 shots. That tells us that we are exactly over the target. Various health economists have calculated a NNTV for COVID-19 vaccines. Ronald Brown, a health economist in Canada, estimated that the NNTV to prevent a single case of coronavirus is from 88 to 142. Others have calculated the NNTV to prevent a single case at 256. German and Dutch researchers, using a large (500k) data set from a field study in Israel calculated an NNTV between 200 and 700 to prevent one case of COVID-19 for the mRNA shot marketed by Pfizer. They went further and figured out that the “NNTV to prevent one death is between 9,000 and 100,000 (95% confidence interval), with 16,000 as a point estimate.” You can see why Pharma hates this number so much (I can picture Pharma’s various PR firms sending out an “All hands on deck!” message right now to tell their trolls to attack this article). One would have to inject a lot of people to see any benefit and the more people who are injected the more the potential benefits are offset by the considerable side-effects from the shots. Furthermore, the NNTV to prevent a single case is not a very meaningful measure because most people, particularly children, recover on their own (or even more quickly with ivermectin if treated early). The numbers that health policy makers should really want to know are the NNTV to prevent a single hospitalization, ICU admission, or death. But with the NNTV to prevent a single case already so high, and with significant adverse events from coronavirus vaccines averaging about 15% nationwide, Pharma and the FDA dare not calculate an NNTV for hospitalizations, ICU, and deaths, because then no one would ever take this product (bye bye $93 billion in annual revenue). Increased all cause mortality in the Pfizer clinical trial of adults As Bobby Kennedy explains, Pfizer’s clinical trial in adults showed alarming increases in all cause mortality in the vaccinated: In Pfizer’s 6 month clinical trial in adults — there was 1 covid death out of 22,000 in the vaccine (“treatment”) group and 2 Covid deaths out of 22,000 in the placebo group (see Table s4). So NNTV = 22,000. The catch is there were 5 heart attack deaths in the vaccine group and only 1 in placebo group. So for every 1 life saved from Covid, the Pfizer vaccine kills 4 from heart attacks. All cause mortality in the 6 month study was 20 in vaccine group and 14 in placebo group. So a 42% all cause mortality increase among the vaccinated. The vaccine loses practically all efficacy after 6 months so they had to curtail the study. They unblinded and offered the vaccine to the placebo group. At that point the rising harm line had long ago intersected the sinking efficacy line. Former NY Times investigative reporter Alex Berenson also wrote about the bad outcomes for the vaccinated in the Pfizer clinical trial in adults (here). Berenson received a lifetime ban from Twitter for posting Pfizer’s own clinical trial data. Pfizer learned their lesson with the adult trial and so when they conducted a trial of their mRNA vaccine in children ages 5 to 11 they intentionally made it too small (only 2,300 participants) and too short (only followed up for 2 months) in order to hide harms. Estimating an NNTV in children ages 5 to 11 using Pfizer’s own clinical trial data All of the NNTV estimates above are based on data from adults. In kids the NNTV will be even higher (the lower the risk, the higher the NNTV to prevent a single bad outcome). Children ages 5 to 11 are at extremely low risk of death from coronavirus. In a meta-analysis combining data from 5 studies, Stanford researchers Cathrine Axfors and John Ioannidis found a median infection fatality rate (IFR) of 0.0027% in children ages 0-19. In children ages 5 to 11 the IFR is even lower. Depending on the study one looks at, COVID-19 is slightly less dangerous or roughly equivalent to the flu in children. So how many children would need to be injected with Pharma’s mRNA shot in order to prevent a single hospitalization, ICU admission, or death? Let’s examine Pfizer’s EUA application and the FDA’s risk-benefit analysis. By Pfizer’s own admission, there were zero hospitalization, ICU admissions, or deaths, in the treatment or control group in their study of 2,300 children ages 5 to 11. So the Number Needed to Vaccinate in order to prevent a single hospitalization, ICU admission, or death, according to Pfizer’s own data, is infinity. ∞. Not the good kind of infinity as in God or love or time or the universe. This is the bad kind of infinity as in you could vaccinate every child age 5 to 11 in the U.S. and not prevent a single hospitalization, ICU admission, or death from coronavirus according to Pfizer’s own clinical trial data as submitted to the FDA. Of course Pfizer likes this kind of infinity because it means infinite profits. [Technically speaking the result is “undefined” because mathematically one cannot divide by zero, but you get my point.] Estimating an NNTV and risk-benefit model in children ages 5 to 11 using the limited data that are available Everyone knows that Pfizer was not even trying to conduct a responsible clinical trial of their mRNA shot in kids ages 5 to 11. Pfizer could have submitted to the FDA a paper napkin with the words “Iz Gud!” written in crayon and the VRBPAC would have approved the shot. They are all in the cartel together and they are all looking forward to their massive payoff/payday. But let’s not be like Pharma. Instead, let’s attempt to come up with a best guess estimate based on real world data. Over time, others will develop a much more sophisticated estimate (for example, Walach, Klement, & Aukema, 2021 estimated an NNTV for 3 different populations based on “days post dose”). But for our purposes here I think there is a much easier way to come up with a ballpark NNTV estimate for children ages 5 to 11. Here’s the benefits model: As of October 30, 2021, the CDC stated that 170 children ages 5 to 11 have died of COVID-19-related illness since the start of the pandemic. (That represents less than 0.1% of all coronavirus-related deaths nationwide even though children that age make up 8.7% of the U.S. population). The Pfizer mRNA shot only “works” for about 6 months (it increases risk in the first month, provides moderate protection in months 2 through 4 and then effectiveness begins to wane, which is why all of the FDA modeling only used a 6 month time-frame). So any modeling would have to be based on vaccine effectiveness in connection with the 57 (170/3) children who might otherwise have died of COVID-related illness during a 6-month period. At best, the Pfizer mRNA shot might be 80% effective against hospitalizations and death. That number comes directly from the FDA modeling (p. 32). I am bending over backwards to give Pfizer the benefit of considerable doubt because again, the Pfizer clinical trial showed NO reduction in hospitalizations or death in this age group. So injecting all 28,384,878 children ages 5 to 11 with two doses of Pfizer (which is what the Biden administration wants to do) would save, at most, 45 lives (0.8 effectiveness x 57 fatalities that otherwise would have occurred during that time period = 45). So then the NNTV to prevent a single fatality in this age group is 630,775 (28,384,878 / 45). But it’s a two dose regimen so if one wants to calculate the NNTV per injection the number doubles to 1,261,550. It’s literally the worst NNTV in the history of vaccination. If you inject that many children, you certainly will have lots and lots of serious side effects including disability and death. So let’s look at the risk side of the equation. Here’s the risk model: Because the Pfizer clinical trial has no useable data, I have to immuno-bridge from the nearest age group. 31,761,099 people (so just about 10% more people than in the 5 to 11 age bracket) ages 12 to 24 have gotten at least one coronavirus shot. The COVID-19 vaccine program has only existed for 10 months and younger people have only had access more recently (children 12 to 15 have had access for five months; since May 10) — so we’re looking at roughly the same observational time period as modeled above. During that time, there are 128 reports of fatal side effects following coronavirus mRNA injections in people 12 to 24. (That’s through October 22, 2021. There is a reporting lag though so the actual number of reports that have been filed is surely higher). Kirsch, Rose, and Crawford (2021) estimate that VAERS undercounts fatal reactions by a factor of 41 which would put the total fatal side effects in this age-range at 5,248. (Kirsch et al. represents a conservative estimate because others have put the underreporting factor at 100.) With potentially deadly side effects including myo- and pericarditis disproportionately impacting youth it is reasonable to think that over time the rate of fatal side effects from mRNA shots in children ages 5 to 11 might be similar to those in ages 12 to 24. So, to put it simply, the Biden administration plan would kill 5,248 children via Pfizer mRNA shots in order to save 45 children from dying of coronavirus. For every one child saved by the shot, another 117 would be killed by the shot. The Pfizer mRNA shot fails any honest risk-benefit analysis in children ages 5 to 11. Even under the best circumstances, estimating NNTV and modeling risk vs. benefits is fraught. In the current situation, with a new and novel bioengineered virus, where Pfizer’s data are intentionally underpowered to hide harms, and the FDA, CDC, & Biden Administration are doing everything in their power to push dangerous drugs on kids, making good policy decisions is even more difficult. If the FDA or CDC want to calculate a different NNTV (and explain how they arrived at that number) I’m all ears. But we all know that the FDA refused to calculate an NNTV not because they forgot, but because they knew the number was so high that it would destroy the case for mRNA vaccines in children this age. Your move CDC — your own Guidance document states that you must provide this number. Update: CDC finally mentions NNTV, but . . . Toward the end of the six-hour CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Nov. 2 meeting where the committee voted to recommend Pfizer’s EUA vaccine for children 5 - 11, there was finally a mention of NNTV. It was on slide 36 of a presentation by CDC official D.r Sara Oliver. Unfortunately the CDC estimate was untethered from reality. I’ll explain: Oliver claimed the NNTV to prevent a single case is 10, even though the best lower bound estimate is 88 and other estimates are 200 or higher (see calculations here and here). Then she claimed the NNTV to prevent a single hospitalization is between 2,213 and 8,187. This is dishonest and a violation of scientific norms. NNTV is calculated by dividing 1 by the Absolute Risk Reduction. There was no Absolute Risk Reduction in hospitalizations in the Pfizer clinical trial in kids 5 to 11, because no one was hospitalized in either the treatment or control group. 1/0 is “undefined” not 8,187. Oliver made no estimate of NNTV to prevent a single COVID-19-related death because that is also undefined (again, there were no COVID-related deaths in the treatment or placebo group in the trial so the absolute risk reduction was zero). Oliver also did not model injuries or deaths from the vaccine (she immuno-bridged from an older age group to show benefits but ignored the reported harms from the vaccine in the older age group). I should also note that my estimates of NNTV were based on CDC data showing 170 deaths from COVID-19-related illness in kids ages 5 to 11 over the last 18 months (I got the number directly from the CDC COVID tracking website). However at the ACIP meeting, the CDC said the number of children in this age group who have died of COVID-19-related illness is 94. If 94 is the correct number to use, then the NNTV to prevent a single death from COVID-19 related illness in this age group would be 28,384,878 / 31 = 915,641. But it’s a two-dose regimen, so if one wants to calculate the NNTV-per-injection the number doubles to 1,831,282. I imagine that at most, half of American parents will be foolish enough to inject this toxic product into their kids. At a 50% uptake rate, the ACIP decision to approve the Pfizer shot will likely kill 2,624 children via adverse reactions in order to potentially save 12 from COVID-19-related illness. Now you know why the CDC did not release the meeting materials prior to the ACIP meeting — they could not stand up to any public scrutiny.",What is the Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNTV) to prevent a single COVID-19 fatality in kids 5 to 11 based on the Pfizer EUA application?,other,227620220416994031062220964600288594138
,"Donald Trump would defeat both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris if the former president decides to run in 2024, a new poll revealed Thursday. According to a Rasmussen Reports poll, in a race between Trump and Biden in 2024, 51 percent of possible voters said they would vote for Trump, whereas just 41 percent said they would choose Biden. Independent voters would also overwhelmingly choose the GOP candidate, selecting Trump over Biden by 20 points. The gap in a Trump versus Harris election is even bigger, with Trump topping the Vice President 52 percent to 39 percent. Additionally, one-fifth of Democrats said they would pick Trump rather than either Biden or Harris. When survey participants were asked whether or not Trump should run for president again, 48 percent of likely voters said he should run, while 44 percent said he should not. The Rasmussen poll was conducted from September 21-22 and surveyed 1,000 likely voters. President Biden’s approval rating among Americans continues to drop as a number of crises grip the United States, including thousands of illegal immigrants crossing the southern border, Americans stranded in Afghanistan following Biden’s disastrous withdrawal, and looming COVID-19 mandates. According to a recent Gallup poll, the president’s approval sits in negative territory at just 43 percent, dropping 6 points in one month alone. The survey, which was conducted from September 1-17, also showed that Biden has a 53 percent disapproval rate. “Independents have shown the greatest variation in their opinions of how Biden is doing. Biden’s current 37% approval rating among independents is his lowest to date and 24 points below his personal high of 61%. Two-thirds of Biden’s slide among independents since he took office has occurred in the past three months,” Gallup noted in the survey. Former President Trump has hinted that he will run for the White House again in 2024. On Saturday, September 25, Mr. Trump is holding another rally in Georgia as a “continuation of President Trump’s many appearances in support of candidates and causes that further the MAGA legacy and accomplishments of President Trump’s Administration.” On Wednesday, former President Trump wrote in an email provided to American Military News that “we are losing our country.” “We are losing our Country! The Democrats are vicious and fight like hell, and the Republicans do nothing about it. RINOs fight harder against Republicans than they do against Democrats. They want to be so politically correct, even if that means losing our Country, which is happening now,” Trump wrote, later adding, “Remember, the Fake News Media does not report the truth!”",Rasmussen poll: Trump beating Biden 51%-41% in 2024 presidential poll,other,70777710312636365284863748950531163151
,"The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) approved a measure last month that could pave the way for the Catholic Church to deny President Joe Biden communion. The conservative bishops hope to prevent Biden from participating in the sacred ritual because of his support for abortion rights. Biden is a devout Catholic who considered becoming a priest in his youth. He rarely misses mass, holds a rosary while making critical decisions, and often quotes scriptures. When asked about the bishops' decision Biden said it is ""a private matter and I don't think that's going to happen."" The bishops hope the new guidance would push ""Catholics who are cultural, political, or parochial leaders to witness the faith."" Monsignor Jeffrey Burrill, the general secretary of the USCCB, has been forced to step down due to some serious allegations about his private life. Burrill, a priest from Wisconsin, worked for the USCCB for the past five years and was elected general secretary last year. ""On Monday, we became aware of impending media reports alleging possible improper behavior by Msgr. Burrill. What was shared with us did not include allegations of misconduct with minors. However, in order to avoid becoming a distraction to the operations and ongoing work of the Conference, Monsignor has resigned effective immediately,"" Archbishop Jose Gomez wrote in a memo to U.S. bishops. The PIllar, a Catholic publication, found evidence that the priest engaged in ""serial sexual misconduct."" An analysis of Burrill's phone found that it was emitting data signals from Grindr, a location-based hookup app, on a near-daily basis during parts of 2018, 2019, and 2020. Grindr is an app designed to bring together gay and bisexual men for sexual encounters. Signals showed that he also visited gay bars and private residences associated with the app. While using an app to meet people for sexual encounters shouldn't be frowned upon, it's a big no-no in the Catholic church. Especially for someone in a leadership position. Friar Thomas Berg, a professor of moral theology at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, New York, told The Pillar that use of such apps is strictly against Catholic doctrine. Berg said that ""according to canon law and the Church's tradition, clerics are obliged to observe 'perfect and perpetual continence,' as a reflection of what should be our lived pursuit of our spousal relationship with the Church and with Christ."" Homosexuality, along with all sexual activity outside of heterosexual marriage, is considered a sin in Catholic doctrine. Burrill appears to be an even bigger hypocrite because the USCCB has opposed LGBTQ equality, same-sex adoption, and the development of an LGBTQ suicide hotline. It has also promoted anti-trans legislation. It always seems to be that the religious folks who judge the harshest always wind up having something to hide.

,"Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York continues to raise the bar with regard to hyperbolic and absurd statements. Following the Jan. 6 Capitol incursion, in which the congresswoman was never in any apparent danger, she has disclosed she is in therapy. Ocasio-Cortez also compared the experiences of lawmakers on that day to those of troops who have fought in actual combat. During an interview published last week with Latino USA, the New York Democrat spoke extensively about the riot that briefly suspended now-President Joe Biden’s Electoral College certification. That riot was so emotionally scarring, according to AOC, that lawmakers, such as herself, might as well have “served in war” after the legislative process was briefly disrupted. Advertisement - story continues below “It’s politically sensitive. No one wants to discuss, no one wants to say, ‘oh, boo-hoo,’ but there’s members of Congress that, served in war,” she said, before describing how she worried about how safe Capitol employees, such as food service workers, were during the incursion. She then talked about the aftermath of the violence on herself.“After the 6th, I took some time and it was really [Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts], when I spoke to her what happened to me, like the day of, because I ran to her office and she was like, ‘you need to recognize trauma,’” Ocasio-Cortez told the outlet. How bad was that “trauma?” So severe that the second-term Democratic House member said she’s in therapy to cope with the experience. “Oh yeah, I’m doing therapy but also I’ve just slowed down,” she said. “I think the Trump administration had a lot of us, especially Latino communities, in a very reactive mode. And so, I’ve been putting myself in a more practice space.” AOC in fact compared her perception of the Capitol incursion to the death of her father.“I was freezing, but I just felt like I needed to be away from all these people and all of this, like, you know, busyness,” she said.“It’s been so therapeutic… I feel like it’s been one of the most helpful things for me in resetting than almost anything else that I’ve done.” What an insult to combat veterans everywhere. Ironically, AOC wasn’t even in the Capitol building during the riot which she claimed has left her traumatized. The lawmaker was actually in the nearby Cannon building.In a February fact-check in which The Associated Press attempted to prop up AOC’s embellishing the event, the wire service noted the following: “In an Instagram Live video about the riots, she explained that she was in her office in a neighboring building on the Capitol complex, where she experienced a frightening encounter with a Capitol police officer who she said didn’t announce himself.” The AP added: “Ocasio-Cortez’s office is across the street from the main Capitol building, in the Cannon building, which AP reporters on the scene confirmed was evacuated during the riots.” “The Cannon building is also connected to the Capitol building by a series of tunnels, which allow members of Congress to travel between buildings underground,” the AP added. You’d think from hearing AOC speak about Jan. 6 that she was wielding an office chair and fending off MAGA raiders. In fact, her only notable tense interaction with anyone, as far as she has disclosed, was with a cop who knocked on a door to check on her in a separate building. That’s not exactly a harrowing tale of survival.

,"Mississippi has recorded 72 fetal deaths in unvaccinated pregnant women infected with the coronavirus, state health officials announced Wednesday, sounding the alarm on the virus’s danger in pregnancy. Speaking during a news conference, Mississippi State Health Officer Thomas Dobbs said those deaths had occurred since the start of the pandemic. The number, which includes only deaths that occurred past 20 weeks of gestation, “is twice the background rate of what would be expected,” he said. “That’s quite a number of tragedies that, sadly, would be preventable right now,” Dobbs said, referring to the availability of vaccines. He said the state is also investigating the deaths of eight pregnant women who were infected with the virus. Those deaths occurred over approximately the past four weeks, during the delta variant-fueled surge, he said. Many underwent emergency Caesarean sections in an attempt to save their babies. Advertisement Citing those cases, Dobbs and other state health leaders urged those who are pregnant to get the shot that can protect them from the virus. “We encourage you to please get vaccinated,” said State Epidemiologist Paul Byers, noting that his daughter had recently delivered a healthy baby after rolling up her sleeve. “That’s going to be the best way to ensure that you and your babies stay healthy.” Research has found that pregnant and recently pregnant women face a higher risk of becoming severely ill from covid-19, with an increased likelihood of requiring hospitalization, intensive care and use of a ventilator. Those who contract the virus in pregnancy are also at greater risk of preterm birth. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month began urging coronavirus vaccination in pregnant women, after studies found no increased risk of miscarriage among those who got the shots. Immunization rates are low in the expectant population, with just 24 percent having received at least one shot, according to the CDC. Advertisement “The vaccines are safe and effective, and it has never been more urgent to increase vaccinations as we face the highly transmissible Delta variant and see severe outcomes from covid-19 among unvaccinated pregnant people,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement last month. In Mississippi, the overall vaccination rate has remained stubbornly low. With just under 40 percent fully vaccinated and 48 percent partially vaccinated, its vaccination rate is second-to-last in the nation. The delta variant has hit hard in the state, where recent weeks have been the worst of the pandemic, according to data compiled by The Washington Post. The average number of infections was hovering at about 2,800, down from the 3,586 recorded Aug. 20, but still far above the numbers seen before this summer. Advertisement Almost 1,300 people were hospitalized, and the state recorded its highest number of deaths in a single day Monday, with 124.

,"There is renewed hope that America may soon be saved from Nancy Pelosi’s reign of terror according to a new poll showing that the Democrats are likely to lose control of the House Of Representatives next year. Despite losing seats in November’s elections, Pelosi has doubled down on extremism with her entire caucus unified behind pushing through Joe Biden’s radical agenda. This agenda includes D.C. statehood, new voting laws that will imperial election integrity, sweeping new “domestic terrorism” legislation that would unleash the government on Trump supporters and the illegal immigration disaster. Those positions do not have support according to the survey conducted by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) that shows that Pelosi is by far the most unpopular politician in the country and her party is widely despised. According to a memo released by NRCC, voters in “ticket-splitting” districts that went for Trump; “Democrats in these districts are going to have an uphill battle defending their decisions to vote in lockstep with Pelosi’s socialist agenda.” There is also the matter of the Democrats’ support of the violent race riots that have terrorized Americans most recently seen when Rep. Maxine Waters traveled to Minneapolis to encourage rioting and looting right before the verdict in the George Floyd murder trial and Rep. Rashida Tlab’s call for eliminating the police who she accused of engaging in “government funded’ murder.The poll was conducted across 85 battleground congressional districts also finds that: a majority “do not believe that President Biden’s COVID-19 stimulus is helping them and their family,” that most “do not believe the Democrats’ false promises that Biden’s proposed tax increases will just be on the wealthy,” and that “an overwhelming 75 percent “of voters see the border situation as a crisis or a major problem.” There is also much skepticism over Biden’s out-of-control spending, much of it driven by his big “infrastructure” bill that is less about repairing roads and bridges and more about far-left social engineering, race-based giveaways, and Green New Deal priorities like electric cars. Further adding to Democrats’ woes is the coming loss of House seats in California, New York, and other blue states due to the U.S. Census Bureau’s announcement that population shifts out of the party’s strongholds have resulted in residents fleeing for freer and safer destinations.For the first time ever, Pelosi’s home state has lost a seat. And while it won’t officially shift until after the midterm elections, it marks a trend as California has increasingly become a dystopian, authoritarian hellscape due to decades of ruinous Democrat rule. People are voting with their feet and are leaving in droves to relocate to free states like Florida and Texas which will both get more House seats.
Democrats are going to have a hard time generating the same kind of voter enthusiasm as they did in 2018 and 2020. That could lead to them facing a bloodbath next year that ends Pelosi’s era of legislative terrorism and banishes them from power for a good long time.

,"Joe Biden said this week he's going to send people door-to-door to question people about ... a certain medical decision he wants you to make. It's easy to ignore Biden's words sometimes. Biden doesn't always know what he's saying. The people around Biden are the problem. Like Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra. The same extremist who thinks erasing women by calling them ""birthing people"" people is inclusive. Becerra says you no longer have medical privacy if the government says so.Becerra, representing the Biden administration, thinks not only is it ""absolutely"" the government's business what medical decisions you make for yourself and your family, but it's also the taxpayers' business too. You sir can go fornicate yourself while your assistant health secretary watches. The second sentence doesn't jibe with the first sentence either. Becerra is saying you ""don't have to answer the door"" when Biden's Witnesses come knocking, yet they are there because the Biden admin believes it's the government's business to know if you did what the government wants you to do. A government tyrannical enough to think they have a right to know personal medical decisions is tyrannical enough to demand you open your door. That's usually the direction these things head in. Also, the people being sent to your door? Not scientists. They're volunteers and/or government employees reading talking points given to them by a bureaucratic government agency.

,"According to a new poll conducted by Fox News, only 49% of American voters think President Joe Biden is mentally stable enough to serve as president of the United States. The shocking poll comes after President Biden continues to fail the American people and the world. Respondents of the poll were asked, “Do you think Joe Biden has the mental soundness to serve effectively as president, or not?” Check out what Breitbart reported: While 49 percent said yes, 48 percent said no. When respondents were asked weeks before, between September 7-10, 49 percent said yes, and only 45 percent said no, handing Biden three more points of less confidence in his mental soundness on Sunday. On the question asking if respondents believe “Joe Biden is a strong leader, or not?” only 45 percent said yes, down four points from October of 2020. Fifty-three percent said Biden is not a strong leader, up eight points since October 2020. The poll also asked, “Do you think the country has become more or less united since Joe Biden took office?” Fifty-four percent of the country is less united, while 37 percent said the country is more united since Biden took office.The poor polling numbers on Biden’s mental soundness come as the Foreign Relations Committee’s ranking member, Sen. James Risch (R-ID), on September 14 questioned who is in charge of the Biden-Harris administration. “There’s real questions right now as to who’s making the decisions,” he questioned State Department Secretary Antony Blinken.
Former White House physician for former president’s Barack Obama and Donald Trump, Ronny Jackson has been sounding the alarm in recent months over President Biden’s declining mental state. During an interview with Fox News in July, Jackson predicted that President Joe Biden will be forced to resign or will be faced with the 25th Amendment before he is voted out of office. “And I’ve been saying that it’s only going to get worse, and guess what? We’re watching that happen right before our eyes right now,” Jackson said. “And I’m at the point right now where, you know, I went from, you know, telling people, we should be concerned about what might potentially be going on, to now saying, hey, what is happening right now?” “Where are the people in our academic medicine that were out there calling for President Trump to have a cognitive test? Where are these people?” Jackson added. “There’s something seriously going on with this man right now. And you know, I think that he’s either gonna, he’s either gonna resign, they’re going to convince him to resign from office at some point in the near future for medical issues, or they’re going to have to use the 25th Amendment to get rid of this man right now. There’s some serious stuff going on right now.” Jackson went on to state that “this is a national security issue at this point … it really is.” He later followed up on Twitter with a clip of his segment, noting: “Something’s SERIOUSLY wrong with Biden – and it’s only going to get WORSE!

,"The physician who served as Bill Gates’ private doctor in Seattle in the 1990s says the Microsoft founder and vaccine proponent “refused to vaccinate his own children” when they were young.  “I don’t know if he had them vaccinated as adults, but I can tell you he point blank refused to vaccinate them as children,” the physician said at a behind closed doors medical symposium in Seattle, adding “They were gorgeous kids, really smart and vivacious, and he said they would be OK as it was, they didn’t need any shots.“  The comments caused a stir among physicians at the symposium with claims he was breaking doctor-patient confidentiality, according to reports. However as he was speaking to other physicians, he was not breaking the industry code of conduct.  Gates has three children with his wife Melinda – Jennifer, Rory and Phoebe – born between 1996 and 2002, and according to his former doctor, they are all unvaccinated and healthy.  The news that Bill Gates does not vaccinate his own children, despite being the world’s most active campaigner for mandatory vaccinations, should come as no surprise. Studies prove that the elite do not vaccinate their children. But at the same time they expect the masses to have their children vaccinated.  The elite do not vaccinate  In California, the children most likely to be unvaccinated are white and come from the wealthiest families in Los Angeles, according to a recent study.  The percentage of kindergartners with state-issued personal belief exemptions doubled from 2007 to 2013, from 1.54% to 3.06%. That’s about 17,000 of the wealthiest children, out of more than half a million, opting out of receiving vaccinations.  Vaccine exemption percentages were highest in mostly white, high-income neighborhoods such as Orange County, Santa Barbara and parts of the Bay Area, according to CNN.  The study, which was published in the American Journal of Public Heath, looked at more than 6,200 California schools and found vaccine exemptions were twice as common among kindergartners attending private institutions.  “Very rich and privileged parents like the idea of herd immunity, but they don’t want to take the risks associated with vaccinations when it comes to their own children.

9f10a8a9,"It was an accurate and judicious answer, so naturally it sent climate alarmists into paroxysms of condemnation. The Washington Post slammed Pruitt as a “denier” driven by “unreason.” Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii called Pruitt’s views “extreme” and “irresponsible” — proof of his unfitness to head the EPA. Gina McCarthy, who ran the agency under President Obama, bewailed the danger global warming poses “to all of us who call Earth home,” and said she couldn’t “imagine what additional information [Pruitt] might want from scientists” in order to understand that. Replied Pruitt: “No. I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact. So no — I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. But we don’t know that yet. We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis.” ‘Do you believe,” CNBC’s Joe Kernen asked Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency’s new director, in an interview last Thursday, “that it’s been proven that CO2 is the primary control knob for climate?” Yet for all the hyperventilating, Pruitt’s answer to the question he was asked — whether carbon dioxide is the climate’s “primary control knob” — was entirely sound. “We don’t know that yet,” he said. We don’t. CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases. By contrast, carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere: about 400 ppm (parts per million), or 0.04 percent. Moreover, its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm. Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red. A second coat of paint has much less of an effect, while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all. Advertisement There is a popular theory that atmospheric CO2 amplifies the creation of water vapor, thereby increasing warming through a “positive feedback loop.” But that theory so far is mostly speculative; climate projections using models based on it have consistently failed, nearly always predicting far more warming than has occurred. It should go without saying that if scientists cannot yet make accurate predictions about future climate change, then their understanding of climate science remains highly incomplete. Advertisement Earth’s climate system is unfathomably complex. It is affected by innumerable interacting variables, atmospheric CO2 levels being just one. The more variables there are in any system or train of events, the lower the probability of all of them coming to pass. Your odds of correctly guessing the outcome of a flipped coin are 1 in 2, but your odds of guessing correctly twice in a row are only 1 in 4 — i.e., ½ x ½ Extending your winning streak to a third guess is even less probable: just 1 in 8. Apply that approach to climate change, and it becomes clear why the best response to the alarmists’ frantic predictions is a healthy skepticism. The list of variables that shape climate includes cloud formation, topography, altitude, proximity to the equator, plate tectonics, sunspot cycles, volcanic activity, expansion or contraction of sea ice, conversion of land to agriculture, deforestation, reforestation, direction of winds, soil quality, El Niño and La Niña ocean cycles, prevalence of aerosols (airborne soot, dust, and salt) — and, of course, atmospheric greenhouse gases, both natural and manmade. A comprehensive list would run to hundreds, if not thousands, of elements, none of which scientists would claim to understand with absolute precision. Advertisement But for the sake of argument, say there are merely 15 variables involved in predicting global climate change, and assume that climatologists have mastered each one to a near-perfect accuracy of 95 percent. What are the odds that a climate model built on a system that simple would be reliable? Less than 50/50. (Multiplying .95 by itself 15 times yields 46.3 percent.) Is it any surprise that climate-change predictions in the real world — where the complexities are exponentially greater and the exactitude of knowledge much less — have such a poor track record? Pruitt got it right: Measuring human impacts on climate is indeed “very challenging.” The science is far from settled. That is why calls to radically reduce carbon emissions are so irresponsible — and why dire warnings of what will happen if we don’t are little better than reckless fearmongering.",A 62% Top Tax Rate?,other,

3e8383dd,"The immune system is something that is highly misunderstood not just by everyday people but also by the many conventional doctors who we depend on for health advice.  Most people resort to things like synthetic vitamins and medicines ignoring better natural alternatives to deal with colds and improve immunity, but the cycle of sickness always seems to continue.  For people with compromised immune systems, there are many natural options, and now researchers have discovered what could well be one of the best ways to reset and recharge your immune system; one that happens to be free and is believed to work even in the elderly as well.  White blood cells right help immune response, and they can be recycled through fasting, the study showed.  Three Days to a Whole New Immune System  According to researchers at the University of Southern California, the act of fasting for as little as three days can regenerate the entire immune system, even in elderly people.  The researchers said that fasting helps the body’s stem cells to begin producing new white blood cells, which help to fight off infection.  They added that the discovery could be especially effective for people suffering from damaged immune systems, including chemotherapy patients, who were protected from the toxic impacts of the treatment during the fasting period.  Flipping a “Regenerative Switch”  The researchers said that fasting helps the body’s stem cells to begin producing new white blood cells which help to fight off infection in the body.  “Fasting gives the ‘OK’ for stem cells to go ahead and begin proliferating and rebuild the entire system,” Prof. Valter Longo, Professor of Gerontology and the Biological Sciences at the University of Southern California, told the UK’s The Telegraph.  He added that the body actually removed parts that were damaged, old or inefficient during the fasting process, creating “literally, a new immune system.”  According to Dr. Longo a person’s system recycles unneeded immune cells, especially damaged ones, in order to create energy while they are fasting.  Over the course of his study’s trials, participants were asked to regularly fast between 2-4 days over a 6 month period.  The study was released in June and Dr. Longo said that clinical trials must still be completed, but added that the research looks “very promising.”  sources: telegraph, althealthworks, cell, medicalnewstoday, nationalpost, usc",“Very Promising:” USC Researchers Discover How to Regenerate Your Entire Immune System in 72 Hours,other,
863897d7,"Theresa May has admitted the Government’s social security experts were not consulted before a controversial decision to deny disability benefits to 160,000 vulnerable people. The Social Security Advisory Committee SSAC was only informed of the changes to Personal Independence Payments PIP “on the day they were being introduced”, MPs were told. The admission was described as “outrageous”, as the row dominated Prime Minister’s Questions and led Jeremy Corbyn to brand the Conservatives “the nasty party” again. Meanwhile, The Independent can reveal that the SSAC will now consider the new PIP regulations at a meeting next Wednesday. It raises the prospect of the committee criticising the decision before MPs vote on it, with a threatened Tory revolt – which must happen before 16 March. The Government is introducing emergency legislation to tighten the criteria for PIP, after a tribunal ruled they should also cover conditions including epilepsy, diabetes and dementia. The ruling would cost at least £3.7bn over the next five years, money which should go to “really disabled people who need it”, one minister said – before later apologising.

Read our privacy notice But one Conservative backbencher has warned the Prime Minister of a growing revolt, urging her to “honour” the verdict delivered by the tribunal. In the Commons, the Labour leader said: “This is a shameful decision that will affect people with dementia, those suffering cognitive disorders due to stroke, military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and those with schizophrenia.” He urged Ms May to “think again” – raising the SSAC, which normally consulted on proposed changes “before the regulations are laid in Parliament”. In reply, the Prime Minister insisted no one currently receiving PIP would “see a reduction in their benefits”. She told MPs: “What the court said is the regulations were unclear – that is why we’re clarifying the regulations and we’re ensuring they reflect the original intention that was agreed by this Parliament.” And she added: “The Work and Pensions Secretary called the chairman of the Social Security Advisory Committee and spoke to him about the regulations on the day they were being introduced.” Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, said later: “Given that these changes will impact over 150,000 disabled people, it is outrageous that the Government did not allow these changes to be considered by the Social Security Committee.” A DWP spokeswoman said it was allowed to bypass the SSAC when announcing new regulations if the decision was a “matter of urgency”. And she argued that was the case with the PIP ruling, which “threatened to undermine the consistency of assessments and create confusion” – although it was made in December. The Independent understands the last time the SSAC was not consulted on a welfare measure was in the previous parliament, over cuts to migrant benefits. Mr Corbyn also attacked the comments by George Freeman, the head of the Downing Street policy unit, noting that Ms May, in 2002, described the Tories as the “nasty party”. “Her policy chair suggested people with debilitating conditions were those who, and I quote, ‘take pills at home, who suffer from anxiety and were not really disabled’. Isn’t that proof the nasty party is still around?” he asked. But Ms May said she hoped MPs would accept Mr Freeman’s apology, issued earlier this week. The tribunal also said that claimants who needed support to take medication should be assessed in the same way as those managing therapies such as dialysis at home.","Dr. Didier Raoult published new results of 1,061 coronavirus patients treated using hdroxychloroquine with 91% success rate.

It avoids worsening and clears virus persistence and contagiosity in most cases.” We first wrote about renowned Dr. Didier Raoult after he and his team of French researchers conducted a study which showed that 100% of coronavirus patients that received a combination of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment. In a follow-up study, which has a larger sample size of 80 COVID-19 patients, the team found a clinical improvement in all but one 86 year-old patient who died, and one 74-year old patient still in intensive care unit. The team also found that, by administering hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin, they were able to observe an improvement in all cases, except in one patient who arrived with an advanced form, who was over the age of 86, and in whom the evolution was irreversible, according to a new paper published today in IHU Méditerranée Infection. We now have new updates. Tonight, Dr. Oz said during an interview that Dr. Raoult is about to publish the results of his new study. Dr. OZ announced that Dr. Didier Raoult has now treated 1000 coronavirus patient with 99.3% success rate. Of the 1000 patients treatments, 20 patients went to the ICU and 7 patients died. Dr. Raoult said the side effects were trivial things like rash etc. Below is the interview with Dr. Oz talking about his discussion with Dr. Raoul.  The video starts at 21:42 minutes.

7d021245,"The phone number to report Iowa caucus results was posted on a fringe internet message board on Monday night along with encouragement to “clog the lines,” an indication that jammed phone lines that left some caucus managers on hold for hours may have in part been due to prank calls. An Iowa Democratic Party official said the influx of calls to the reporting hotline included “supporters of President Trump who called to express their displeasure with the Democratic Party.” The party official’s comments were first reported late Wednesday by Bloomberg News. Users on a politics-focused section of the fringe 4chan message board repeatedly posted the phone number for the Iowa Democratic Party, which was found by a simple Google search, both as screenshots and in plain text, alongside instructions. ""They have to call in the results now. Very long hold times being reported. Phone line being clogged,"" one user posted at about 11 p.m. ET on Monday, three hours after the caucuses began. ""Uh oh how unfortunate it would be for a bunch of mischief makers to start clogging the lines,"" responded another anonymous user, sarcastically. Some users chimed in, posting alleged wait times on hold, imploring others to “clog the lines [and] make the call lads.” Rob Sand, state auditor of Iowa, said he took results calls on Monday night as a volunteer and received an influx of calls that appeared to have been generated by a post on the internet. “A lot of calls came in at a certain point where it was clear somebody had published the hotline number somewhere,” Sand said. He cautioned that he could not speak for other people who were taking calls and said he did not get any calls that said they were from Trump supporters. He added that the system prevented people from reporting fake results. He also said he was able to identify fake calls quickly. “If I picked up the phone and it was clear after the first handful of words that someone was not calling to report the results, I just hung up,” Sand said. Mandy McClure, communications director for the Iowa Democratic Party, confirmed that the hotline received “an unusually high volume of inbound phone calls to its caucus hotline, including supporters of President Trump.” “The unexplained, and at times hostile, calls contributed to the delay in the Iowa Democratic Party’s collection of results, but in no way affected the integrity of information gathered or the accuracy of data sets reported,” McClure said in a statement. The telephone reporting problems added to other issues, notably a smartphone app that did not work for some people and that also had a coding problem that prevented results from being reported properly, pushing more caucus volunteers to the phone lines. Iowa Democratic Party officials said that party staff members and volunteers flagged and subsequently blocked repeat callers who appeared to be reaching out in an attempt to interfere with their reporting duties. These included callers who would hang up immediately after being connected and callers who expressed support for Trump and displeasure with the Democratic Party. It’s unclear how many prank calls the party received or how much they contributed to wait times. Some calls came from Iowans looking to confirm details of their evening’s caucus, party officials said. The party has not responded to requests for information on how many individuals were manning the phone lines on Monday night. The Trump campaign denied any affiliation with people clogging phone lines on Monday night. “We don’t know anything about this, but perhaps Democrats should consider using an app that works,"" communications director Tim Murtaugh said. ""It's laughable that they would try to blame Trump for their own incompetence."" Several officials at caucuses attended by NBC News reporters struggled with lengthy hold times that made it impossible for them to report results. 4chan, which hosts an anonymous and often extremist politics board called /pol/ whose users have largely supported Trump since 2015, is known for extensive online political trolling and targeted harassment campaigns. On debate nights, 4chan users often direct one another to swarm and manipulate specific online polls on other websites with repeat votes, a practice known as “brigading” in online communities. The polls would then be used by politicians and partisan websites to claim shocking upsets. Users on 4chan are anonymous, and usernames are randomly generated with each new thread. Some users on 4chan pushed back against users claiming to spam phone lines on Monday night. One user said he didn’t want other trolls “making us the scapegoat for the DNC.” “I can’t wait for the news headlines saying nefarious trolls ruined the caucus,” another added. Two precinct chairs said they were unaware of any interference with the hotline and doubted it made much of an impact. “I wouldn’t blame the Republicans,” said Tom Courtney, co-chair of the Des Moines County Democratic Party and a precinct chair. “I’d love to blame the Republicans and the Trumpers, but I don’t know.” Mike Carberry, chair for a precinct in Iowa City, also said he doubted prank calls were the primary reason for long wait times. “I’m sure that they got some calls, but those could be sorted through relatively quickly,” he said. Another hotline staffer who asked to remain anonymous said they were aware of the prank calls but that they were not the main reason that results were delayed. “It was definitely a problem,” the staffer said. “But it was definitely not the reason that results were a mess.”",Clog the lines': Internet trolls deliberately disrupted the Iowa caucuses hotline for reporting results,other,

c79c81bd,"Chinese scientists believe the deadly coronavirus may have started life in a research facility just 300 yards from the Wuhan fish market. A new bombshell paper from the Beijing-sponsored South China University of Technology says that the Wuhan Center for Disease Control WHCDC could have spawned the contagion in Hubei province. 'The possible origins of 2019-nCoV coronavirus,' penned by scholars Botao Xiao and Lei Xiao claims the WHCDC kept disease-ridden animals in laboratories, including 605 bats. It also mentions that bats - which are linked to coronavirus - once attacked a researcher and 'blood of bat was on his skin.' Workers in protective gear carry a bag containing a giant salamander that was reported to have escaped from the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan in central China's Hubei Province in January The report says: 'Genome sequences from patients were 96% or 89% identical to the Bat CoV ZC45 coronavirus originally found in Rhinolophus affinis intermediate horseshoe bat.' It describes how the only native bats are found around 600 miles away from the Wuhan seafood market and that the probability of bats flying from Yunnan and Zhejiang provinces was minimal. In addition there is little to suggest the local populace eat the bats as evidenced by testimonies of 31 residents and 28 visitors. Instead the authors point to research being carried out withing a few hundred yards at the WHCDC. One of the researchers at the WHCDC described quarantining himself for two weeks after a bat's blood got on his skin, according to the report. That same man also quarantined himself after a bat urinated on him. 'The WHCDC was also adjacent to the Union Hospital Figure 1, bottom where the first group of doctors were infected during this epidemic.' The report says. And he also mentions discovering a live tick from a bat - parasites known for their ability to pass infections through a host animal's blood. 'The WHCDC was also adjacent to the Union Hospital Figure 1, bottom where the first group of doctors were infected during this epidemic.' The report says. 'It is plausible that the virus leaked around and some of them contaminated the initial patients in this epidemic, though solid proofs are needed in future study.' And as well as the WHCDC, the report suggests that the Wuhan Institute of Virology could also have leaked the virus, as has previously been reported by MailOnline. 'This laboratory reported that the Chinese horseshoe bats were natural reservoirs for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS-CoV which caused the 2002-3 pandemic,' the report says. members of staff of the Wuhan Hygiene Emergency Response Team drive their vehicle as they leave the closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city of Wuhan, in Hubei on January 11 The seafood market after it was locked off by police at the beginning of January 'The principle investigator participated in a project which generated a chimeric virus using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, and reported the potential for human emergence 10. A direct speculation was that SARS-CoV or its derivative might leak from the laboratory.' The report concludes that 'the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan.' It comes as the outbreak has infected more than 69,000 people globally, with 1,665 deaths in China - most of these in the central province of Hubei.","Woman forced to watch ‘Roots’ to ‘understand her racism,’ Cedar Rapids police say",other,

The company announced that the shots V590 and V591 were ‘well tolerated’ by test patients, however they generated an ‘inferior’ immune system response in comparison with natural infection. The company stated that instead it will focus on research into therapeutic drugs labeled as MK-7110 and MK-4482. The drugs aim to protect patients from the damage of an overactive immune response to the virus. “Interim results from a Phase 3 study showed a greater than 50 percent reduction in the risk of death or respiratory failure in patients hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19,” the company’s statement noted of the MK-7110 drug. Merck is to receive around $356 million from the US government to fast-track production of the potential treatments under Operation Warp Speed. Chief Marketing Officer Michael Nally recently told Bloomberg that Merck is aiming to produce some 20 million courses of the MK-4482 drug, an oral antiviral which patients will take twice a day for five days.

A monthly analysis of forecasts prepared for Chancellor Philip Hammond showed that dozens of independent experts believe national output will continue growing this year. On average, they expect growth to continue at exactly the same rate as forecast before the EU referendum. Contrary to what economists and big banks like Goldman Sachs said, Brexit has heralded a new wave of growth as Britain prepares to unshackle itself from Brussels Craig Mackinlay The verdict was a major reversal following earlier expectations that the country’s decision to leave the EU would deliver a massive shock to the economy. Instead, the data suggests that the historic vote had no significant impact on growth at all. The u-turn was being seen last night as yet another devastating blow to the “Project Fear” scaremongering campaign run by the defeated and embittered supporters of Britain’s EU membership. GETTY Forecasts for Chancellor Philip Hammond showed that national output will continue growing this year GETTY Craig Mackinlay said in just three months 'Project Fear had descended to Project Farce' And it came amid growing expectations in the City that the Government is preparing for a “hard Brexit” that will mean quitting the EU single market and imposing full border controls.

cd9cd5e8,"MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin oversaw a test Wednesday of a new hypersonic glide vehicle, declaring that the weapon is impossible to intercept and will ensure Russia’s security for decades to come. Speaking to Russia’s top military brass after watching the live feed of the launch of the Avangard vehicle from the Defense Ministry’s control room, Putin said the successful test was a “great success” and an “excellent New Year’s gift to the nation.” The test comes amid bitter tensions in Russia-U.S. relations, which have sunk to their lowest level since the Cold War times over the conflict in Ukraine, the war in Syria and the allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Putin's hopes for repairing ties with Washington under President Donald Trump have fizzled amid investigations into allegations of Trump's campaign ties with Russia, and tensions have escalated as the U.S. administration slapped Russia with new waves of sanctions. The Avangard was among the array of new nuclear weapons that Putin presented in March, saying that Russia had to develop them in response to the development of the U.S. missile defense system that could erode Russia’s nuclear deterrent.

6b94e779,"Historians may look to 2015 as the year when shit really started hitting the fan. Some snapshots: In just the past few months, record-setting heat waves in Pakistan and India each killed more than 1,000 people. In Washington state’s Olympic National Park, the rainforest caught fire for the first time in living memory. London reached 98 degrees Fahrenheit during the hottest July day ever recorded in the U.K.; The Guardian briefly had to pause its live blog of the heat wave because its computer servers overheated. In California, suffering from its worst drought in a millennium, a 50-acre brush fire swelled seventyfold in a matter of hours, jumping across the I-15 freeway during rush-hour traffic. Then, a few days later, the region was pounded by intense, virtually unheard-of summer rains. Puerto Rico is under its strictest water rationing in history as a monster El Niño forms in the tropical Pacific Ocean, shifting weather patterns worldwide. On July 20th, James Hansen, the former NASA climatologist who brought climate change to the public’s attention in the summer of 1988, issued a bombshell: He and a team of climate scientists had identified a newly important feedback mechanism off the coast of Antarctica that suggests mean sea levels could rise 10 times faster than previously predicted: 10 feet by 2065. The authors included this chilling warning: If emissions aren’t cut, “We conclude that multi-meter sea-level rise would become practically unavoidable. Social disruption and economic consequences of such large sea-level rise could be devastating. It is not difficult to imagine that conflicts arising from forced migrations and economic collapse might make the planet ungovernable, threatening the fabric of civilization.” Eric Rignot, a climate scientist at NASA and the University of California-Irvine and a co-author on Hansen’s study, said their new research doesn’t necessarily change the worst-case scenario on sea-level rise, it just makes it much more pressing to think about and discuss, especially among world leaders. In particular, says Rignot, the new research shows a two-degree Celsius rise in global temperature — the previously agreed upon “safe” level of climate change — “would be a catastrophe for sea-level rise.” Hansen’s new study also shows how complicated and unpredictable climate change can be. Even as global ocean temperatures rise to their highest levels in recorded history, some parts of the ocean, near where ice is melting exceptionally fast, are actually cooling, slowing ocean circulation currents and sending weather patterns into a frenzy. Sure enough, a persistently cold patch of ocean is starting to show up just south of Greenland, exactly where previous experimental predictions of a sudden surge of freshwater from melting ice expected it to be. Michael Mann, another prominent climate scientist, recently said of the unexpectedly sudden Atlantic slowdown, “This is yet another example of where observations suggest that climate model predictions may be too conservative when it comes to the pace at which certain aspects of climate change are proceeding.” Since storm systems and jet streams in the United States and Europe partially draw their energy from the difference in ocean temperatures, the implication of one patch of ocean cooling while the rest of the ocean warms is profound. Storms will get stronger, and sea-level rise will accelerate. Scientists like Hansen only expect extreme weather to get worse in the years to come, though Mann said it was still “unclear” whether recent severe winters on the East Coast are connected to the phenomenon. And yet, these aren’t even the most disturbing changes happening to the Earth’s biosphere that climate scientists are discovering this year. For that, you have to look not at the rising sea levels but to what is actually happening within the oceans themselves. Water temperatures this year in the North Pacific have never been this high for this long over such a large area — and it is already having a profound effect on marine life.

During a survey on July 4th, federal officials spotted 115 whales in a single hour near the Farallon Islands — enough to issue a boating warning. Humpbacks are occasionally seen offshore in California, but rarely so close to the coast or in such numbers. Why are they coming so close to shore? Exceptionally warm water has concentrated the krill and anchovies they feed on into a narrow band of relatively cool coastal water. The whales are having a heyday. “It’s unbelievable,” Thomas told a local paper. “Whales are all over the place.” Last fall, in northern Alaska, in the same part of the Arctic where Shell is planning to drill for oil, federal scientists discovered 35,000 walruses congregating on a single beach. It was the largest-ever documented “haul out” of walruses, and a sign that sea ice, their favored habitat, is becoming harder and harder to find. Marine life is moving north, adapting in real time to the warming ocean. Great white sharks have been sighted breeding near Monterey Bay, California, the farthest north that’s ever been known to occur. A blue marlin was caught last summer near Catalina Island — 1,000 miles north of its typical range. Across California, there have been sightings of non-native animals moving north, such as Mexican red crabs. No species may be as uniquely endangered as the one most associated with the Pacific Northwest, the salmon. Every two weeks, Bill Peterson, an oceanographer and senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Oregon, takes to the sea to collect data he uses to forecast the return of salmon. What he’s been seeing this year is deeply troubling. Salmon are crucial to their coastal ecosystem like perhaps few other species on the planet. A significant portion of the nitrogen in West Coast forests has been traced back to salmon, which can travel hundreds of miles upstream to lay their eggs. The largest trees on Earth simply wouldn’t exist without salmon. But their situation is precarious. This year, officials in California are bringing salmon downstream in convoys of trucks, because river levels are too low and the temperatures too warm for them to have a reasonable chance of surviving. One species, the winter-run Chinook salmon, is at a particularly increased risk of decline in the next few years, should the warm water persist offshore. “You talk to fishermen, and they all say: ‘We’ve never seen anything like this before,’ ” says Peterson. “So when you have no experience with something like this, it gets like, ‘What the hell’s going on?’ “ Atmospheric scientists increasingly believe that the exceptionally warm waters over the past months are the early indications of a phase shift in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a cyclical warming of the North Pacific that happens a few times each century. Positive phases of the PDO have been known to last for 15 to 20 years, during which global warming can increase at double the rate as during negative phases of the PDO. It also makes big El Niños, like this year’s, more likely. The nature of PDO phase shifts is unpredictable — climate scientists simply haven’t yet figured out precisely what’s behind them and why they happen when they do. It’s not a permanent change — the ocean’s temperature will likely drop from these record highs, at least temporarily, some time over the next few years — but the impact on marine species will be lasting, and scientists have pointed to the PDO as a global-warming preview. “The climate [change] models predict this gentle, slow increase in temperature,” says Peterson, “but the main problem we’ve had for the last few years is the variability is so high. As scientists, we can’t keep up with it, and neither can the animals.” Peterson likens it to a boxer getting pummeled round after round: “At some point, you knock them down, and the fight is over.” Attendant with this weird wildlife behavior is a stunning drop in the number of plankton — the basis of the ocean’s food chain. In July, another major study concluded that acidifying oceans are likely to have a “quite traumatic” impact on plankton diversity, with some species dying out while others flourish. As the oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, it’s converted into carbonic acid — and the pH of seawater declines. According to lead author Stephanie Dutkiewicz of MIT, that trend means “the whole food chain is going to be different.” The Hansen study may have gotten more attention, but the Dutkiewicz study, and others like it, could have even more dire implications for our future. The rapid changes Dutkiewicz and her colleagues are observing have shocked some of their fellow scientists into thinking that yes, actually, we’re heading toward the worst-case scenario. Unlike a prediction of massive sea-level rise just decades away, the warming and acidifying oceans represent a problem that seems to have kick-started a mass extinction on the same time scale. Jacquelyn Gill is a paleoecologist at the University of Maine. She knows a lot about extinction, and her work is more relevant than ever. Essentially, she’s trying to save the species that are alive right now by learning more about what killed off the ones that aren’t. The ancient data she studies shows “really compelling evidence that there can be events of abrupt climate change that can happen well within human life spans. We’re talking less than a decade.” For the past year or two, a persistent change in winds over the North Pacific has given rise to what meteorologists and oceanographers are calling “the blob” — a highly anomalous patch of warm water between Hawaii, Alaska and Baja California that’s thrown the marine ecosystem into a tailspin. Amid warmer temperatures, plankton numbers have plummeted, and the myriad species that depend on them have migrated or seen their own numbers dwindle. Significant northward surges of warm water have happened before, even frequently. El Niño, for example, does this on a predictable basis. But what’s happening this year appears to be something new. Some climate scientists think that the wind shift is linked to the rapid decline in Arctic sea ice over the past few years, which separate research has shown makes weather patterns more likely to get stuck. A similar shift in the behavior of the jet stream has also contributed to the California drought and severe polar vortex winters in the Northeast over the past two years. An amplified jet-stream pattern has produced an unusual doldrum off the West Coast that’s persisted for most of the past 18 months. Daniel Swain, a Stanford University meteorologist, has called it the “Ridiculously Resilient Ridge” — weather patterns just aren’t supposed to last this long. What’s increasingly uncontroversial among scientists is that in many ecosystems, the impacts of the current off-the-charts temperatures in the North Pacific will linger for years, or longer. The largest ocean on Earth, the Pacific is exhibiting cyclical variability to greater extremes than other ocean basins. While the North Pacific is currently the most dramatic area of change in the world’s oceans, it’s not alone: Globally, 2014 was a record-setting year for ocean temperatures, and 2015 is on pace to beat it soundly, boosted by the El Niño in the Pacific. Six percent of the world’s reefs could disappear before the end of the decade, perhaps permanently, thanks to warming waters. Since warmer oceans expand in volume, it’s also leading to a surge in sea-level rise. One recent study showed a slowdown in Atlantic Ocean currents, perhaps linked to glacial melt from Greenland, that caused a four-inch rise in sea levels along the Northeast coast in just two years, from 2009 to 2010. To be sure, it seems like this sudden and unpredicted surge was only temporary, but scientists who studied the surge estimated it to be a 1-in-850-year event, and it’s been blamed on accelerated beach erosion “almost as significant as some hurricane events.” Possibly worse than rising ocean temperatures is the acidification of the waters. Acidification has a direct effect on mollusks and other marine animals with hard outer bodies: A striking study last year showed that, along the West Coast, the shells of tiny snails are already dissolving, with as-yet-unknown consequences on the ecosystem. One of the study’s authors, Nina Bednaršek, told Science magazine that the snails’ shells, pitted by the acidifying ocean, resembled “cauliflower” or “sandpaper.” A similarly striking study by more than a dozen of the world’s top ocean scientists this July said that the current pace of increasing carbon emissions would force an “effectively irreversible” change on ocean ecosystems during this century. In as little as a decade, the study suggested, chemical changes will rise significantly above background levels in nearly half of the world’s oceans. “I used to think it was kind of hard to make things in the ocean go extinct,” James Barry of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California told the Seattle Times in 2013. “But this change we’re seeing is happening so fast it’s almost instantaneous.” Thanks to the pressure we’re putting on the planet’s ecosystem — warming, acidification and good old-fashioned pollution — the oceans are set up for several decades of rapid change. Here’s what could happen next. The combination of excessive nutrients from agricultural runoff, abnormal wind patterns and the warming oceans is already creating seasonal dead zones in coastal regions when algae blooms suck up most of the available oxygen. The appearance of low-oxygen regions has doubled in frequency every 10 years since 1960 and should continue to grow over the coming decades at an even greater rate. So far, dead zones have remained mostly close to the coasts, but in the 21st century, deep-ocean dead zones could become common. These low-oxygen regions could gradually expand in size — potentially thousands of miles across — which would force fish, whales, pretty much everything upward. If this were to occur, large sections of the temperate deep oceans would suffer should the oxygen-free layer grow so pronounced that it stratifies, pushing surface ocean warming into overdrive and hindering upwelling of cooler, nutrient-rich deeper water. Enhanced evaporation from the warmer oceans will create heavier downpours, perhaps destabilizing the root systems of forests, and accelerated runoff will pour more excess nutrients into coastal areas, further enhancing dead zones. In the past year, downpours have broken records in Long Island, Phoenix, Detroit, Baltimore, Houston and Pensacola, Florida. Evidence for the above scenario comes in large part from our best understanding of what happened 250 million years ago, during the “Great Dying,” when more than 90 percent of all oceanic species perished after a pulse of carbon dioxide and methane from land-based sources began a period of profound climate change. The conditions that triggered “Great Dying” took hundreds of thousands of years to develop. But humans have been emitting carbon dioxide at a much quicker rate, so the current mass extinction only took 100 years or so to kick-start. With all these stressors working against it, a hypoxic feedback loop could wind up destroying some of the oceans’ most species-rich ecosystems within our lifetime. A recent study by Sarah Moffitt of the University of California-Davis said it could take the ocean thousands of years to recover. “Looking forward for my kid, people in the future are not going to have the same ocean that I have today,” Moffitt said. As you might expect, having tickets to the front row of a global environmental catastrophe is taking an increasingly emotional toll on scientists, and in some cases pushing them toward advocacy. Of the two dozen or so scientists I interviewed for this piece, virtually all drifted into apocalyptic language at some point. For Simone Alin, an oceanographer focusing on ocean acidification at NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle, the changes she’s seeing hit close to home. The Puget Sound is a natural laboratory for the coming decades of rapid change because its waters are naturally more acidified than most of the world’s marine ecosystems. The local oyster industry here is already seeing serious impacts from acidifying waters and is going to great lengths to avoid a total collapse. Alin calls oysters, which are non-native, the canary in the coal mine for the Puget Sound: “A canary is also not native to a coal mine, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a good indicator of change.” Though she works on fundamental oceanic changes every day, the Dutkiewicz study on the impending large-scale changes to plankton caught her off-guard: “This was alarming to me because if the basis of the food web changes, then . . . everything could change, right?” Alin’s frank discussion of the looming oceanic apocalypse is perhaps a product of studying unfathomable change every day. But four years ago, the birth of her twins “heightened the whole issue,” she says. “I was worried enough about these problems before having kids that I maybe wondered whether it was a good idea. Now, it just makes me feel crushed.” Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist and evangelical Christian, moved from Canada to Texas with her husband, a pastor, precisely because of its vulnerability to climate change. There, she engages with the evangelical community on science — almost as a missionary would. But she’s already planning her exit strategy: “If we continue on our current pathway, Canada will be home for us long term. But the majority of people don’t have an exit strategy. . . . So that’s who I’m here trying to help.” James Hansen, the dean of climate scientists, retired from NASA in 2013 to become a climate activist. But for all the gloom of the report he just put his name to, Hansen is actually somewhat hopeful. That’s because he knows that climate change has a straightforward solution: End fossil-fuel use as quickly as possible. If tomorrow, the leaders of the United States and China would agree to a sufficiently strong, coordinated carbon tax that’s also applied to imports, the rest of the world would have no choice but to sign up. This idea has already been pitched to Congress several times, with tepid bipartisan support. Even though a carbon tax is probably a long shot, for Hansen, even the slim possibility that bold action like this might happen is enough for him to devote the rest of his life to working to achieve it. On a conference call with reporters in July, Hansen said a potential joint U.S.-China carbon tax is more important than whatever happens at the United Nations climate talks in Paris. One group Hansen is helping is Our Children’s Trust, a legal advocacy organization that’s filed a number of novel challenges on behalf of minors under the idea that climate change is a violation of intergenerational equity — children, the group argues, are lawfully entitled to inherit a healthy planet. A separate challenge to U.S. law is being brought by a former EPA scientist arguing that carbon dioxide isn’t just a pollutant (which, under the Clean Air Act, can dissipate on its own), it’s also a toxic substance. In general, these substances have exceptionally long life spans in the environment, cause an unreasonable risk, and therefore require remediation. In this case, remediation may involve planting vast numbers of trees or restoring wetlands to bury excess carbon underground. Even if these novel challenges succeed, it will take years before a bend in the curve is noticeable. But maybe that’s enough. When all feels lost, saving a few species will feel like a triumph.

073f3552,"EXCLUSIVE: Third of cases won by terrorists, murderers and lags EXCLUSIVE by TOM NEWTON DUNN, Political Editor 17th August 2015, 11:01 pm Updated: 5th April 2016, 8:00 pm A THIRD of those who have won against Britain at the European Court of Human Rights are terrorists, prisoners or criminals, figures show. Among claimants the court found in favour of since 1975 are murderers, terrorists in Iraq and IRA gunmen. Its recent controversial judgments include refusing a Home Office deportation order for Islamic hate preacher Abu Qatada and insisting prisoners must have the vote. The figures showing that the 297 victories against the UK included 94 prisoners, terrorists or criminals are revealed in a glossy dossier produced by ECHR-supporting pressure group RightsInfo. It is a response to criticisms of the Strasbourg court by Tory ministers and The Sun. Commons Justice Committee chairman Bob Neill MP said: “This is well beyond what any sensible person would say is real human rights. “It’s mission creep, law made by judges who are not judges and many from countries with questionable human rights and very little judicial experience. “Political pressure groups take advantage of that naivety, which costs the British taxpayer considerable sums.” It costs £286million a year to fund the euro judges’ governing body, the Council of Europe and £23million of that comes from British taxes. Since 1959, the UK has won only 41 per cent of 513 ECHR cases. RightsInfo’s Adam Wagner said: “People accused of crimes or convicted of offences have human rights too, so it isn’t surprising that they have featured in 40 years of cases.” The fanatic Hate preacher Abu Qatada Reuters 3 ABU Qatada won the right to stay in Britain rather than be deported to his homeland Jordan after ECHR judges said there was a risk evidence obtained by torture could be used against him in a terror trial. In that case Qatada, described as Osama Bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe, would not get a fair trial. The Strasbourg court’s 2012 decision overturned a ruling by UK law lords. Qatada had been convicted in Jordan in 1999 in his absence of a conspiracy to carry out bombings. He was finally returned in 2013 after Jordan agreed torture evidence would not be used. PRISONER John Hirst first won the right for convicted criminals to vote following a European court ruling in 2005. Hirst had previously lost his claim at the High Court in 2001 but took the case to Europe and won. No UK Government has legislated on the issue despite four rulings in Hirst’s favour by the Strasbourg-based court. Hirst who served 25 years for the unprovoked manslaughter of his landlady, said: “You don’t lose your status in civil society just because you’re in prison — you are still a member of the public.” The IRA men Ulster Unionist MP Ken Maginnis 3 TEN IRA men killed by soldiers and the Royal Ulster Constabulary had their human rights violated, the ECHR ruled in 2001. Its judges said the authorities failed to conduct proper inquiries into the deaths. The UK Government was ordered to pay each of the IRA men’s families £10,000. Tory and Ulster Unionist MPs said the ruling was a disgrace and an insult to those who tried to keep the peace.

Physicians have demonstrated the powerful antiviral action of vitamin C for decades. There has been a lack of media coverage of this effective and successful approach against viruses in general, and coronavirus in particular.  It is very important to maximize the body’s anti-oxidative capacity and natural immunity to prevent and minimize symptoms when a virus attacks the human body. The host environment is crucial. Preventing is obviously easier than treating severe illness.  But treat serious illness seriously. Do not hesitate to seek medical attention. It is not an either-or choice. Vitamin C can be used right along with medicines when they are indicated.  “I have not seen any flu yet that was not cured or markedly ameliorated by massive doses of vitamin C.” Robert F. Cathcart, MD  The physicians of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service and the International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine urge a nutrient-based method to prevent or minimize symptoms for future viral infection. The following inexpensive supplemental levels are recommended for adults; for children reduce these in proportion to body weight:  Vitamin C: 3,000 milligrams or more daily, in divided doses.  Vitamin D3: 2,000 International Units daily. Start with 5,000 IU/day for two weeks, then reduce to 2,000  Magnesium: 400 mg daily in citrate, malate, chelate, or chloride form  Zinc: 20 mg daily  Selenium: 100 mcg micrograms daily  Vitamin C [1] , Vitamin D [2] , magnesium [3] , zinc [4] , and selenium [5] have been shown to strengthen the immune system against viruses.  The basis for using high doses of vitamin C to prevent and combat virus-caused illness may be traced back to vitamin C’s early success against polio, first reported in the late 1940s. [6] Many people are unaware, even surprised, to learn this. Further clinical evidence built up over the decades, leading to an anti-virus protocol published in 1980. [7]  It is important to remember that preventing and treating respiratory infections with large amounts of vitamin C is well established. Those who believe that vitamin C generally has merit, but massive doses are ineffective or somehow harmful, will do well to read the original papers for themselves. To dismiss the work of these doctors simply because they had success so long ago sidesteps a more important question: Why has the benefit of their clinical experience not been presented to the public by responsible governmental authorities, especially in the face of a viral pandemic?

d462dc8d,"A blitz on helping people with drink, drug and other problems find work is to be launched after it emerged they cost the taxpayer £10 billion a year.  Iain Duncan Smith revealed the figure yesterday as he promised a jobcentre scheme to identify the addictions which are stopping claimants find work.  Under the Universal Support regime, officials will take personal charge of each case to ensure they get treatment, mental health counselling and other support.  Iain Duncan Smith said it costs the taxpayer £10.1billion a year to support people addicted to drugs file photo  Once people have found a job, they will remain under the care of the jobcentre until they are doing sufficient hours to leave the accompanying Universal Credit benefits regime altogether.  The work and pensions secretary said the aim was to find jobs for people who had been ‘parked’ on a life on benefits by the last government.  Mr Duncan Smith added: ‘Too often in the past, people with complex barriers such as addiction, indebtedness or homelessness were written off to a life on benefits.  'Through Universal Support we are putting an end to this, and offering wraparound support for those that need it.  ‘These problems are the root causes of poverty – and if not tackled mean that the cycle of disadvantage will continue into the next generation.’  He pointed to a devastating report by the Lankelly Chase Foundation which found the wider cost to the taxpayer of supporting people with the most severe problems was £10.1 billion a year.  Mr Duncan Smith, pictured, has faced fierce criticism from the Church for his welfare reforms  There are 586,000 people categorised as having at least one serious problem – such as addiction to drink or drugs or homelessness.  Officials said the aim was to reduce the cost of social breakdown by addressing all the ‘barriers’ they face to getting on in life and finding a job.  One said: ‘This is not about cutting benefits – it is about reducing the need.’  Mr Duncan Smith revealed that, for the first time, the Department of Health had acknowledged that having a job improved a person’s health and well-being.  The new policy will allow people who claim mental health problems are preventing them from finding work to access more support.  In about 60 per cent of cases, the problem they have is anxiety or depression.  Help will also be available for people who have problems with housing, childcare, debt and a history of offending.  Mr Duncan Smith has faced fierce criticism from the Church and critics on the Left for his welfare reforms, which they claimed would create ‘unacceptable’ suffering.  But, following a raft of changes to the benefits system designed to incentivise work, the number of children growing up in homes in which nobody has a job has plummeted by 478,000.  The overall number of households where no one was in work fell to the lowest on record in 2015 – almost 700,000 fewer than in 2010.","Addicts and alcoholics cost us £10billion a year, says Duncan Smith",other,
310fd67e,"A Powell River, B.C., man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) opted for a medically assisted death last Tuesday after years of struggling to fund 24-hour care that kept him close to his son.

,"For several weeks “fringe” doctors have argued that the spike proteins produced by the COVID-19 vaccines may result in numerous deaths this winter season. Now, weeks later, the New England Journal of Medicine is suggesting a similar situation.  The spike proteins produced by the COVID-19 vaccines may lead to myocarditis and neurological concerns. Advertisement - story continues below Alex Berenson reported: Downstream effects of the antibodies that people produce against the coronavirus spike protein may lead to myocarditis and even neurological concerns, two veteran medical researchers have written in the top medical journal in the United States. TRENDING: All Four Botswana ""Nu"" Variant Patients Were Fully Vaccinated Our immune systems produce these antibodies in response to both vaccination and natural infection with Covid. However – though the researchers do not say so explicitly, possibly because doing so would be politically untenable – spike protein antibody levels are MUCH higher following vaccination than infection. Thus the downstream response to vaccination may be more severe. The NEJM published the short paper Wednesday in its Basic Implications of Clinical Observations series. One of the writers is an oncologist and professor at Harvard Medical School; the other is a cancer researcher who has his own lab at the University of California, Davis.
