Nearly half of voters 46% think Britain's economy would be weaker if the Labour leader replaced her in Downing Street while 43% think she is the right person for the job, according to the ComRes State-of-the-Nation poll for the Daily Express. And the Tories do not appear to have suffered any loss of popularity from the Windrush scandal that forced Amber Rudd to quit as Home Secretary earlier this week, the research shows. Labour and the Tories are level-pegging at 40% each in the poll, virtually unchanged from a previous survey before the scandal about the immigration status of Caribbean migrants and their descendants erupted. The poll findings are likely to cheer the Prime Minister and her team ahead of town hall elections in England on Thursday, the first electoral test for her Government since last year's general election. Theresa May's most powerful quotes Thu, August 31, 2017 Play slideshow Getty Images 1 of 8 'I will be ruthless in cutting out waste, streamlining structures and improving efficiency' With the Remainers becoming so intransigent, the Prime Minister may need to call their bluff by going to the country Minister Designed to give a snapshot of the nation's mood ahead of the local vote, the poll also found voters are upbeat about modern Britain and take particular pride in the country's Royal Family and NHS. Andrew Hawkins, ComRes Chairman, said: “That the two main parties are polling neck and neck despite Theresa May’s considerable lead over Jeremy Corbyn on economic management points either to voters being prepared to support a party that they believe will them poorer, or at election time they will instead opt for what they feel is the safer option. The danger for Labour is not just that there is a discrepancy, it is the scale of it, including among young people whose support is vital if the Party is to stand a chance of winning an election. The ComRes survey of more than 2,000 voters, conducted online last weekend, showed 47% of voters think international confidence in Britain's economy is stronger with Mrs May as Prime Minister than it would be under Mr Corbyn. Only 30% disagreed with the statement. GETTY The poll found that Brits take particular pride in the country's Royal Family It also found that Tory support was unchanged at 40% since a previous poll by the firm published in the Sunday Express on 13 April. Labour support was down by one point to 40% while the Lib Dems were up two points to 9%. Labour's failure to capitalise on the Government's recent rocky patch has led to a growing confidence in Tory ranks. Senior Conservatives believe Mr Corbyn's own troubles over allegations of anti-Semitism in his party and his refusal to back robust action against Russia and Syria is damaging his populist appeal. Some Brexit ministers are even understood to be pressing Theresa May to signal her readiness to call a snap general election as a threat to bring Brexit rebels into line. One minister told the Daily Express: With the Remainers becoming so intransigent, the Prime Minister may need to call their bluff by going to the country. The minister added: She may need to call a Brexit election to settle this once and for all. We need to make life uncomfortable for Remain-backing MPs who represent constituencies that voted leave. Labour would be slaughtered in its northern heartlands if the party backed staying in the customs union. It would be a complete betrayal of the referendum. GETTY 47% of voters think international confidence in UK's economy would be weaker under Jeremy Corbyn Other Tories were less enthusiastic about the election plan however. One senior backbencher said: An election now would be stupid. It didn't work last year and wouldn't work now. Mrs May tomorrow convenes a meeting of her Brexit sub-committee to discuss whether a controversial blueprint for a customs partnership should become the Government's preferred option in the negotiations with Brussels. Ministers are bitterly divided over the issue, with Brexit enthusiasts fearing the plan is an attempt to keep Britain tied into the customs union forever. One Whitehall source said: The committee is split down the middle and the decision could come down to a show of hands. Cabinet Brexiteers were furious after peers, including 19 rebel Tories, backed a rebel amendment seeking to give Parliament powers to reopen reject an EU exit deal and force the Government to reopen talks.

1,1,true/false,"What are the Covid variants and do vaccines still work? What are the Covid variants and do vaccines still work? By Michelle Roberts  Health editor, BBC News online Published 11 March  Image source, Getty Images  The Omicron variant has become the dominant type of coronavirus circulating in many countries, overtaking previous variants, such as Delta.  It can be contagious, even if you have been vaccinated. But current vaccines are still providing good protection against severe illness.  What is Omicron?  A variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world, which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.  Omicron is strikingly different from some other Covid variants, and the one that started the pandemic, because of the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone.  In particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.  This could make it better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infections with Covid. Omicron does appear to be highly spreadable, even in those who have been fully jabbed.  There are several types or sublineages of Omicron - including BA.1.1.529 and BA.2 - that have slightly different mutations from each other.  The World Health Organization says mounting evidence suggests BA.2 is proving to be a bit more transmissible than the others.  Is it worse than other variants?  The evidence shows Omicron infections tend to be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.  That is largely down to the amount of protection or immunity that people have built against Covid from past infections and vaccination, rather than changes to the virus itself.  Even so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.  Are current vaccines good enough?  Preliminary lab studies found two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough, which is why some countries, including the UK, are giving people extra doses to boost their immunity.  UK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.  As with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or who have significant underlying health conditions.  Although current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron, they are still the best line of defence against Covid.  They have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma.  Doctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants.  How quickly could we get new vaccines against variants?  Updated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.  Manufacturers could scale up production quickly too, and regulators have already discussed how to fast-track the approval process.  Moderna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March, although lab tests in animals suggest they may offer little advantage over standard shots.  What about the other variants?  The most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern.  Why do variants occur?  Viruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce, but they aren't perfect at it. Errors creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus.  If this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive.  The more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur."
2,2,true/false,"MSM link Italy neo-Nazi weapon haul to ‘pro-Russian separatists’ despite police saying the OPPOSITE The majority of Britons say the police have lost control of the streets, a shocking Daily Mail poll reveals today. According to the exclusive survey, 57 per cent of people say officers have surrendered control of our neighbourhoods and criminals have no fear of being caught. Amid skyrocketing levels of crime, the poll also reveals that a quarter of the population don’t feel safe at night in their local area. And it suggests that one of the biggest factors behind the recent surge in lawlessness is a lack of ‘bobbies on the beat’. An incredible 60 per cent of the public say they haven’t seen a police officer in their street in the past year. The poll will increase pressure on ministers to get a grip on the violent crime wave engulfing the UK. Nearly 2,000 British people were surveyed with over half expressing a lack of faith in the police Rates of violence have soared to the worst level since records began, with offences more than doubling in the past four years across the country. The survey of 2,000 adults was conducted for the Mail by ComRes and We The People. Among a series of worrying findings, it revealed: In Half 51 per cent of those surveyed who had been a victim of crime in the past two years said police did not even bother going to their home, and nearly a third of victims 30 per cent were told to gather evidence themselves; In Some 57 per cent of the public feel police no longer treat crimes such as burglary with the seriousness they deserve; In Three in four Britons 76 per cent want more bobbies on the beat; In More than half 54 per cent believe political correctness is partly to blame for the soaring murder rate in cities. David Green, of the think-tank Civitas, said: ‘It is not surprising that 57 per cent of people think the police have lost control of our streets because criminals no longer fear being caught. ‘One of the primary causes has been the reduction in the number of police by about 20,000 officers since 2010. Rates of violent offences have nearly doubled over the last two years to reach an all-time high ‘Criminals are deterred when they see a regular police presence on the streets, but if they never see a uniform they become emboldened.’ The Police Federation of England and Wales’ operational policing lead, Simon Kempton, said the poll mirrored its own research. ‘Neighbourhood policing which was once a key feature of every community has all but vanished,’ he said. ‘Local bobbies who once would have been a familiar sight on the streets of the UK are being redeployed to emergency response teams to meet the increasing demand facing policing. ‘What is already clear is that greater investment – both monetary and in terms of personnel – is needed to put the boots back on the ground.’ Two thirds 67 per cent of Britons said political correctness and the fear of offending minorities was partly to blame for the problems encountered tackling child sex grooming gangs in major cities. It comes after a succession of convictions of Asian grooming gangs operating in towns including Rochdale, Rotherham, Oxford, Newcastle and Aylesbury. The Mail poll found more than half 57 per cent of those surveyed thought the police were scared of upsetting some parts of society, resulting in them being less effective at their job. The shocking results of the poll found that bin men were more highly rated than police officers And when asked to compare public services, the poll found bin men were more highly rated than police officers, with approval ratings of 49 per cent compared to 43 per cent. Association of Police and Crime Commissioners chairman David Lloyd said: ‘Police and crime commissioners recognise the challenges that policing is under, driven in part by changes in demand on the service, including increased complexity of crime. ‘We also understand the real concerns that people have and, in consultation with the public, are fully committed to ensuring that the resources we have are directed in the right way.’ National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for neighbourhood policing, Deputy Chief Constable Gavin Stephens, said police chiefs were reviewing neighbourhood policing, adding: ‘The latest inspection of police forces in England and Wales found a good level of service to the public. ‘But they also found forces were under strain as they deal with rising crime and demand that is more complex – and an unprecedented terror threat – with fewer officers. ‘We recognise how important and valuable neighbourhood policing teams are to local communities. With the College of Policing, we are carrying out the most fundamental review of neighbourhood policing in a decade so officers are equipped with tactics that are proven to work.’"

5,5,true/false,"COVID-19 vaccine has hefty response in nonhuman primates A replicating RNA vaccine, formulated with a lipid-based nanoparticle emulsion that goes by the acronym LION, produces antibodies against the COVID-19 coronavirus in mice and primates with a single immunization. These antibodies potently neutralize the virus.  The effects occurred within two weeks after administration through injection into a muscle. The level of antibodies generated was comparable to those in people who are recovering from COVID-19.  The vaccine induced coronavirus-neutralizing antibodies robustly in both younger and older mice. This hopeful finding was well-received by the researchers, because of the concern that the elderly are less likely to respond to vaccination due to their aging immune systems.  Vulnerability to severe COVID-19 in older people increases with age; a vaccination suitable for this high-risk population is a key goal of the scientists.    The vaccine candidate's lead investigator is Jesse Erasmus, a postdoctoral fellow of microbiology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Randy Carnell / UW Medicine    This vaccine design, as shown in lab studies, is designed to avoid immune responses that could enhance a respiratory disease induced by the coronavirus. Instead, it directs the immune response toward more protective antiviral measures. In addition to antibody production that can block the infection, the vaccine induces T cells, a type of white blood cell that provides a second line of defense if antibodies don’t completely block the infection.  The methods and results of animal tests of the replicating RNA coronavirus vaccine candidate vaccine are published in the July 20 issue of Science Translational Medicine. The lead author of the paper is Jesse H. Erasmus, a Washington Research Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow in the laboratory of Deborah Heydenberg Fuller. She is a professor of microbiology at the University of Washington School of Medicine and division chief of Infectious Diseases and Translational Medicine at the Washington National Primate Research Center.  As COVID-19 continues to spread, the discovery and widespread distribution of safe and effective vaccines are essential for slamming down the pandemic. Scores of vaccine candidates are in various stages of testing around the world, from preclinical studies to human trials.  “A vaccine that can stop COVID-19,” Fuller wrote, “will ideally induce protective immunity after only a single immunization, avoid immune responses that could exacerbate virus-induced pathology, be amenable to rapid and cost-effective scale-up and manufacturing, and be capable of inducing immunity in all populations including the elderly who typically respond poorly to vaccines.”    This vaccine candidate has several advantages, says Deborah Fuller, the microbiologist whose UW Medicine lab has been the site of its development.    “That’s a tall order,” she added. She sees conventional nucleic acid vaccines as promising, but at least two immunizations are needed to instill immunity in people. Most DNA vaccines require high doses to achieve protective levels of immunity in humans. Traditional messenger RNA vaccines formulated with lipid nanoparticles to increase their effectiveness may face obstacles of mass-production and shelf life.  To try to overcome these limitations, the labs of Fuller and her collaborators at the National Institutes of Health Rocky Mountain Laboratories and HDT Bio Corp. have developed a replicating RNA version of a coronavirus vaccine.  Replicating RNA vaccines for other infectious diseases and cancers are in the pipeline at several institutions. Replicating RNA expresses a greater amount of protein, and also triggers a virus-sensing stress response that encourages other immune activation.  In the case of the COVID-19 vaccine candidate, the RNA enters cells and instructs them to produce proteins that teach the body to recognize coronaviruses and attack them with antibodies and T cells.  This blockade might keep the viruses from fusing to cells and injecting their genetic code for commandeering. These antibodies provide protection by interfering with the protein machinery on the spikes of the coronavirus.  This replicating RNA vaccine contains the novel Lipid InOrganic Nanoparticle (LION) developed by Seattle-based biotechnology company HDT Bio Corp. “We are pleased with the collaboration with UW to move our RNA vaccine platform forward,” said the company’s CEO, Steve Reed.  Amit P. Khandhar, the lead formulation developer, added, “RNA molecules are highly susceptible to degradation by enzymes. LION is a next-generation nanoparticle formulation that protects the RNA molecule and enables in vivo delivery of the vaccine after a simple mixing step at the pharmacy.”    Erasmus holds a tissue culture plate with SARS-CoV-2 plaques, which are used to determine the quantity of infectious virus particles. Photo by Jesse Erasmus    The nanoparticle enhances the vaccine’s ability to provoke the desired immune reaction, and its stability; this vaccine is stable at room temperature for at least one week, and its components enable it to be rapidly manufactured in large quantities, should it prove safe and effective in human trials. The scientists anticipate that lower and fewer doses would need to be made to immunize a population.  A key differentiating factor between LION and the lipid nanoparticle delivery vehicle used in other mRNA COVID-19 vaccines is its ability to be formulated with mRNA by simple mixing at the bedside. The two-vial approach enabled by LION allows for manufacturing of the formulation independently from the mRNA component.  The research team is working to advance the vaccine to Phase 1 testing in people, in which it would be introduced into a small group of healthy volunteers to gather preliminary data on whether it is safe and generates the desired immune response. HDT is advancing the replicon RNA with LION vaccine toward clinical development under the name HDT-301.

6,6,true/false,"New McDonalds Has a Cool Design Element: an Ancient Roman Road When ancient archaeological remnants are uncovered at a building site, it usually means a big red light for the construction project. But why not incorporate newly uncovered cultural treasures into the building, instead? That’s what McDonalds did when it found an ancient Roman road beneath an Italian construction project, reports Elisabetta Povoledo for The New York Times.  The newly opened result is the only McDonalds on Earth that includes an ancient Roman artifact. It all started in 2014, Povoledo reports, when workers in Marino came across a 147-foot-long stretch of road dating between the first and second centuries B.C.E. The road would otherwise have been documented and reburied, Povelodo notes. Instead, McDonalds sponsored an archaeological dig and used the road as part of the restaurant.  This isn't the first time, nor will it be the last that something like this has happened at a building site. Take 50 Bowery, a proposed hotel on New York’s Lower East Side, which as SmartNews reported in 2013, was delayed after builders found what appeared to be the remains of a tavern frequented by George Washington and others. The tavern was never positively identified, writes The New York Times’ Emily Rueb, but the site’s owners decided to incorporate some historical elements into the structure and build an exhibition space inside the hotel.  Now that this unique McDonalds has opened its doors, visitors can walk along transparent flooring and view the road or go underground to get a better look at three skeletons and other remnants, The Telegraph’s Nick Squires reports. The road is thought to have connected to the Appian Way, an ancient Roman superhighway that linked Rome to southern Italy.  While a Happy Meal with a side of history may seem quirky, the McDonald's location is far from the weirdest store in the fast food giant's repertoire. Indeed, McDonalds restaurants can be found in everything from airplanes to mansions. Not too far from Marino, there’s even a McDonalds decorated with Roman-style mosaics and marble fountains. In that sense, the new restaurant will fit right in.  (h/t mental_floss)"
7,7,true/false,"The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell' for Monday, September 16th, 2013 A disgruntled employee at the State Department changed the biographies of President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence to say their term was coming to an end on Monday — nine days before President-elect Joe Biden is to be sworn in — two current-serving diplomats with knowledge of the situation told BuzzFeed News.

8,8,true/false,"Did Climate Change Intensify Hurricane Harvey? “The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm.” Hurricane Harvey looms off the coast of Texas, as seen from aboard the International Space Station. Every so often, the worst-case scenario comes to pass. As of Sunday afternoon, the remnants of Hurricane Harvey seem likely to exceed the worst forecasts that preceded the storm. The entire Houston metropolitan region is flooding: Interstates are under feet of water, local authorities have asked boat owners to join rescue efforts, and most of the streams and rivers near the city are in flood stage. Some models suggest that the storm will linger over the area until Wednesday night, dumping 50 inches of water in total on Houston and the surrounding area. “Local rainfall amounts of 50 inches would exceed any previous Texas rainfall record. The breadth and intensity of this rainfall are beyond anything experienced before,” said a statement from the National Weather Service. “Catastrophic flooding is now underway and expected to continue for several days.” (In years of weather reporting, I have never seen a statement this blunt and ominous.) This means that thousands of people—and perhaps tens of thousands of people—are facing a terrifying and all-too-real struggle to survive right now. In an age when the climate is changing rapidly, a natural question to ask is: What role did human-caused global warming play in strengthening this storm? Climate scientists, who specialize in thinking about the Earth system as a whole, are often reticent to link any one weather event to global climate change. But they say that aspects of the case of Hurricane Harvey—and the recent history of tropical cyclones worldwide—suggest global warming is making a bad situation worse. It may not be obvious why global warming has anything to do with hurricane strength. Climate change is caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. These gases prevent some of the sun’s rays from bouncing back into space, trapping heat in the planetary system and raising air temperatures all over the world. This warmer air causes evaporation to happen faster, which can lead to more moisture in the atmosphere. But that phenomenon alone does not explain climate change’s effects on Harvey. Storms like Harvey are helped by one of the consequences of climate change: As the air warms, some of that heat is absorbed by the ocean, which in turn raises the temperature of the sea’s upper layers. Harvey benefited from unusually toasty waters in the Gulf of Mexico. As the storm roared toward Houston last week, sea-surface waters near Texas rose to between 2.7 and 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit above average. These waters were some of the hottest spots of ocean surface in the world. The tropical storm, feeding off this unusual warmth, was able to progress from a tropical depression to a category-four hurricane in roughly 48 hours. “This is the main fuel for the storm,” says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research. “Although these storms occur naturally, the storm is apt to be more intense, maybe a bit bigger, longer-lasting, and with much heavier rainfalls [because of that ocean heat].” This also suggests an explanation for one of Harvey’s strangest and scariest behaviors. The storm intensified up until the moment of landfall, achieving category-four strength hours before it slammed into the Texas coast. This is not only rare for tropical cyclones in the western Gulf of Mexico: It may be unique. In the past 30 years of records, no storms west of Florida have intensified in the last 12 hours before landfall. Why do storms normally weaken—and why didn’t Harvey? As mentioned above, hurricanes feed and grow on warm ocean surface waters. But as they grow, their strong winds often pick up seawater, churning the oceans and moving the warmest waters deep below the surface. The same winds also bring newer, colder water closer to the atmosphere, which usually serves to drain energy and weaken the storm. That didn’t happen with Harvey. The hurricane churned up water 100 or even 200 meters below the surface, said Trenberth, but this water was still warm—meaning that the storm could keep growing and strengthening. “Harvey was not in a good position to intensify the way it did, because it was so close to land. It’s amazing it was able to do that,” he told me. All of this said, a storm like Harvey could have happened even if there was no climate change. Planning experts have long fretted over the possibility of a major hurricane striking Houston. Harvey is also a powerful hurricane forming in one of the most hurricane-friendly regions of the world at the peak of hurricane season. Storms similar to it would form in any climate. But Trenberth says that the extra heat could make the storm more costly and more powerful, overpowering and eventually breaking local drainage systems. “The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm,” he said. “It may have been a strong storm, and it may have caused a lot of problems anyway—but [human-caused climate change] amplifies the damage considerably.” More generally, it’s still unclear what effect climate change is having on hurricane formation across the greater Atlantic Ocean. A draft version of a major U.S. government review of climate science due out later this year says there is “medium confidence” that human activities “have contributed to the observed upward trend in North Atlantic hurricane activity since the 1970s.” Houston has been ground zero for super-damaging storms lately. It has seen four 100-year flooding events since the spring of 2015, according to the meteorologist Eric Holthaus. The city also sees 167 percent more heavy downpours than it did in the 1950s. Meanwhile, only one-sixth of its residents have federal flood insurance, though that program has struggled to adjust to the increased flooding risk associated with climate change. Yet even compared to recent storms, Harvey is unprecedented—just the kind of weird weather that scientists expect to see more of as the planet warms. Harvey has already dumped more water on Harris County than Tropical Storm Allison, the area’s previous worst-ever flooding disaster in 2001, though it has only lasted half the time of that earlier storm. And it will keep raining. As of Sunday afternoon, Buffalo Bayou, a major river near downtown Houston, is one foot above flood stage. It is projected to rise as much as another 12 feet today alone."
9,9,true/false,"COVID infections may give more potent immunity than vaccines – but that doesn’t mean you should try to catch it Israel was way ahead of the rest of the world when it came to COVID vaccination, so it’s not surprising that data from this corner of the Mediterranean causes a lot of excitement – it’s a glimpse into the future.  Indeed, this happened recently when researchers at Maccabi Healthcare Services in Tel Aviv released a preprint (a study that is yet to be reviewed by other experts) suggesting people who had been infected with COVID had greater protection than vaccinated people against becoming reinfected with the delta variant. Unfortunately, some took this to mean that getting COVID is a better idea than getting vaccinated.  First, the possibility that a COVID infection leads to longer-lived immunity than vaccination is not far-fetched. Infection exposes our immune system to several viral proteins, whereas the most commonly used COVID vaccines introduce a single antigen: the spike protein. This results in a more directed but also a more restricted immune response than after infection.  Although people who have had COVID can get reinfected, naturally acquired immunity continues to evolve over time and antibodies remain detectable for longer than was first anticipated. New evidence suggests that immunity following both severe and mild infection protects against both symptomatic and asymptomatic reinfection.  However, apart from the danger of drawing conclusions from data that other scientists have not yet reviewed, it is also crucial to put the data in the right context. Although the study draws attention to the potency of naturally acquired immunity, it does not consider the risks involved in achieving natural immunity through infection. Nor does it cast a shadow on vaccine-generated immunity.  In fact, the benefit of vaccination is not even addressed in the study since unvaccinated people without prior infection were not included for comparison. The low rate of COVID-related hospitalisations among vaccinated participants (eight out of 16,000) would probably be strikingly lower than among non-vaccinated people without prior infection, but this group was not included in the analyses.  A common reason to remain unvaccinated is the misconception that waiting for natural immunity by choosing infection over vaccination is an option. But infection-acquired immunity may come at a heavy cost.  Indeed, apart from the overt risks of severe illness or death, several recent studies show that otherwise healthy people who have recovered from COVID have a substantially increased risk of longer-term serious health problems, including myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), blood clots and stroke, compared to vaccinated people. And the most rigorous safety monitoring in US history has shown that COVID vaccines are safe and effective.  With cases surging globally and deaths driven by the delta variant, waiting for infection – and risking long-term health problems, severe illness and death – to achieve immunity to the very same infection is as fruitless as it is dangerous.  Hybrid immunity  The Israeli preprint does, however, shed light on our increasing understanding of the potent immunity induced by getting the vaccine after having COVID – so-called hybrid immunity. Several studies show a substantial boost in both antibody and T-cell responses to vaccine in people with previous COVID infection.  A recent report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that people who’d recovered from COVID and were later vaccinated had half the risk of reinfection compared with unvaccinated people who’d previously had COVID. So it’s still worth getting the vaccine, even if you have previously had COVID.  The effective immune booster following the combination of natural immunity and a single subsequent vaccine jab also raises the question of whether one dose is enough for people who have had COVID. Several studies report that immune responses to a single dose of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine exceed those after two doses in people without prior infection.  Several countries, such as France, Italy and Germany, therefore now recommend a single dose for people with a previous COVID infection. And infection without vaccination is recognised as immunity for the current Israeli green pass rules.  Although directing boosters to people who have not been infected may make the most of limited vaccine supplies, personalised schedules and exemptions from vaccine mandates may be logistically tricky in the midst of a pandemic. Antibody screening before vaccination is time-consuming and expensive, and it introduces practical challenges in identifying those who have or haven’t previously had COVID. These exemptions could slow vaccine rollout rather than speed it up.  As unprecedented research efforts deliver knowledge about our immune responses to COVID infection and vaccination on a daily basis, we must critically view the data together with all the facts that relate to it. We are far from bringing the pandemic to an end, and the potential risks of being infected are unquestionable. Our priority should be to slow transmission and get vaccines to those who remain unvaccinated and need them the most. To avoid vaccination, wait for infection and hope for natural immunity makes little sense."
10,10,true/false,"Killers could avoid whole life terms by pleading guilty, Sentencing Council suggests Groups including the Cato Institute, a libertarian research organization that challenges aspects of climate change, have called concerns about the bears overblown, arguing that some research shows that the animals have survived repeated warm periods. But scientists say during earlier warm periods the bears probably had significant alternative food sources, notably whales, that they do not have today. Poignant images of bears on isolated ice floes or roaming land in search of food have been used by conservation groups and others to showcase the need for action to reduce warming. Occasionally, though, these images have been shown to be not what they seem. After a video of an emaciated bear picking through garbage cans in the Canadian Arctic was posted online by National Geographic in 2017, the magazine acknowledged that the bear’s condition might not be related to climate change. Scientists had pointed out that there was no way of knowing what was wrong with the bear; it might have been sick or very old. The new study did not include projections in which emissions were reduced drastically, said Cecilia M. Bitz, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington and an author of the study. The researchers needed to be able to determine, as precisely as possible, the periods when sea ice would be gone from a particular region. “If we had wanted to look at many models we wouldn’t have been able to do that,” Dr. Bitz said. Andrew Derocher, a polar bear researcher at the University of Alberta who was not involved in the study, said the findings “are very consistent with what we’re seeing from empirical studies like monitoring work in the field.” “The study shows clearly that polar bears are going to do better with less warming,” he added. “But no matter which scenario you look at, there are serious concerns about conservation of the species.” Of the 19 subpopulations, little is known about some of them, particularly those in the Russian Arctic. Of subpopulations that have been studied, some — generally those in areas with less ice loss — have shown little population decline so far. But others, notably in the southern Beaufort Sea off northeastern Alaska, and in the western Hudson Bay in Canada, have been severely affected by loss of sea ice."
11,11,true/false,"Coronavirus: Why You Must Act Now If you stack up the orange bars until 1/22, you get 444 cases. Now add up all the grey bars. They add up to ~12,000 cases. So when Wuhan thought it had 444 cases, it had 27 times more. If France thinks it has 1,400 cases, it might well have tens of thousands  The same math applies to Paris. With ~30 cases inside the city, the true number of cases is likely to be in the hundreds, maybe thousands. With 300 cases in the Ile-de-France region, the total cases in the region might already exceed tens of thousands.  Spain and Madrid  Spain has very similar numbers as France 1,200 cases vs. 1,400, and both have 30 deaths. That means the same rules are valid: Spain has probably upwards of 20k true cases already.  In the Comunidad de Madrid region, with 600 official cases and 17 deaths, the true number of cases is likely between 10,000 and 60,000.  If you read these data and tell yourself: “Impossible, this can’t be true”, just think this: With this number of cases, Wuhan was already in lockdown.  With the number of cases we see today in countries like the US, Spain, France, Iran, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden or Switzerland, Wuhan was already in lockdown.  And if you’re telling yourself: “Well, Hubei is just one region”, let me remind you that it has nearly 60 million people, bigger than Spain and about the size of France.  2. What Will Happen When These Coronavirus Cases Materialize?  So the coronavirus is already here. It’s hidden, and it’s growing exponentially.  What will happen in our countries when it hits? It’s easy to know, because we already have several places where it’s happening. The best examples are Hubei and Italy.  Fatality Rates  The World Health Organization WHO quotes 3.4% as the fatality rate % people who contract the coronavirus and then die. This number is out of context so let me explain it.  It really depends on the country and the moment: between 0.6% in South Korea and 4.4% in Iran. So what is it? We can use a trick to figure it out.  The two ways you can calculate the fatality rate is Deaths/Total Cases and Death/Closed Cases. The first one is likely to be an underestimate, because lots of open cases can still end up in death. The second is an overestimate, because it’s likely that deaths are closed quicker than recoveries.  What I did was look at how both evolve over time. Both of these numbers will converge to the same result once all cases are closed, so if you project past trends to the future, you can make a guess on what the final fatality rate will be.  This is what you see in the data. China’s fatality rate is now between 3.6% and 6.1%. If you project that in the future, it looks like it converges towards ~3.8%-4%. This is double the current estimate, and 30 times worse than the flu.  It is made up of two completely different realities though: Hubei and the rest of China.  Hubei’s fatality rate will probably converge towards 4.8%. Meanwhile, for the rest of China, it will likely converge to ~0.9%:  I also charted the numbers for Iran, Italy and South Korea, the only countries with enough deaths to make this somewhat relevant.  Iran’s and Italy’s Deaths / Total Cases are both converging towards the 3%-4% range. My guess is their numbers will end up around that figure too.  South Korea is the most interesting example, because these 2 numbers are completely disconnected: deaths / total cases is only 0.6%, but deaths / closed cases is a whopping 48%. My take on it is that a few unique things are happening there. First, they’re testing everybody with so many open cases, the death rate seems low, and leaving the cases open for longer so they close cases quickly when the patient is dead. Second, they have a lot of hospital beds see chart 17.b. There might also be other reasons we don’t know. What is relevant is that deaths/cases has hovered around 0.5% since the beginning, suggesting it will stay there, likely heavily influenced by the healthcare system and crisis management.  The last relevant example is the Diamond Princess cruise: with 706 cases, 6 deaths and 100 recoveries, the fatality rate will be between 1% and 6.5%.  Note that the age distribution in each country will also have an impact: Since mortality is much higher for older people, countries with an aging population like Japan will be harder hit on average than younger countries like Nigeria. There are also weather factors, especially humidity and temperature, but it’s still unclear how this will impact transmission and fatality rates.  This is what you can conclude:  Excluding these, countries that are prepared will see a fatality rate of ~0.5% South Korea to 0.9% rest of China.  Countries that are overwhelmed will have a fatality rate between ~3%-5%  Put in another way: Countries that act fast can reduce the number of deaths by a factor of ten. And that’s just counting the fatality rate. Acting fast also drastically reduces the cases, making this even more of a no-brainer.  Countries that act fast reduce the number of deaths at least by 10x.  So what does a country need to be prepared?  What Will Be the Pressure on the System  Around 20% of cases require hospitalization, 5% of cases require the Intensive Care Unit ICU, and around 2.5% require very intensive help, with items such as ventilators or ECMO extra-corporeal oxygenation.  The problem is that items such as ventilators and ECMO can’t be produced or bought easily. A few years ago, the US had a total of 250 ECMO machines, for example.  So if you suddenly have 100,000 people infected, many of them will want to go get tested. Around 20,000 will require hospitalization, 5,000 will need the ICU, and 1,000 will need machines that we don’t have enough of today. And that’s just with 100,000 cases.  That is without taking into account issues such as masks. A country like the US has only 1% of the masks it needs to cover the needs of its healthcare workers 12M N95, 30M surgical vs. 3.5B needed. If a lot of cases appear at once, there will be masks for only 2 weeks.  Countries like Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong or Singapore, as well as Chinese regions outside of Hubei, have been prepared and given the care that patients need.  But the rest of Western countries are rather going in the direction of Hubei and Italy. So what is happening there?  What an Overwhelmed Healthcare System Looks Like  The stories that happened in Hubei and those in Italy are starting to become eerily similar. Hubei built two hospitals in ten days, but even then, it was completely overwhelmed.  Both complained that patients inundated their hospitals. They had to be taken care of anywhere: in hallways, in waiting rooms…  I heavily recommend this short Twitter thread. It paints a pretty stark picture of Italy today  Healthcare workers spend hours in a single piece of protective gear, because there’s not enough of them. As a result, they can’t leave the infected areas for hours. When they do, they crumble, dehydrated and exhausted. Shifts don’t exist anymore. People are driven back from retirement to cover needs. People who have no idea about nursing are trained overnight to fulfill critical roles. Everybody is on call, always.  Francesca Mangiatordi, an Italian nurse that crumbled in the middle of the war with the Coronavirus  That is, until they become sick. Which happens a lot, because they’re in constant exposure to the virus, without enough protective gear. When that happens, they need to be in quarantine for 14 days, during which they can’t help. Best case scenario, 2 weeks are lost. Worst case, they’re dead.  The worst is in the ICUs, when patients need to share ventilators or ECMOs. These are in fact impossible to share, so the healthcare workers must determine what patient will use it. That really means, which one lives and which one dies.  “After a few days, we have to choose. […] Not everyone can be intubated. We decide based on age and state of health.” —Christian Salaroli, Italian MD.

China Daily/Reuters, via Washington Post  All of this is what drives a system to have a fatality rate of ~4% instead of ~0.5%. If you want your city or your country to be part of the 4%, don’t do anything today.  Satellite images show Behesht Masoumeh cemetery in the Iranian city of Qom. Photograph: ©2020 Maxar Technologies. Via The Guardian and the The New York Times.  3. What Should You Do?  Flatten the Curve  This is a pandemic now. It can’t be eliminated. But what we can do is reduce its impact.  Some countries have been exemplary at this. The best one is Taiwan, which is extremely connected with China and yet still has as of today fewer than 50 cases. This recent paper explain all the measures they took early on, which were focused on containment.  They have been able to contain it, but most countries lacked this expertise and didn’t. Now, they’re playing a different game: mitigation. They need to make this virus as inoffensive as possible.  If we reduce the infections as much as possible, our healthcare system will be able to handle cases much better, driving the fatality rate down. And, if we spread this over time, we will reach a point where the rest of society can be vaccinated, eliminating the risk altogether. So our goal is not to eliminate coronavirus contagions. It’s to postpone them.  The more we postpone cases, the better the healthcare system can function, the lower the mortality rate, and the higher the share of the population that will be vaccinated before it gets infected.  How do we flatten the curve?  Social Distancing  There is one very simple thing that we can do and that works: social distancing.  If you go back to the Wuhan graph, you will remember that as soon as there was a lockdown, cases went down. That’s because people didn’t interact with each other, and the virus didn’t spread.  The current scientific consensus is that this virus can be spread within 2 meters 6 feet if somebody coughs. Otherwise, the droplets fall to the ground and don’t infect you.  The worst infection then becomes through surfaces: The virus survives for up to 9 days on different surfaces such as metal, ceramics and plastics. That means things like doorknobs, tables, or elevator buttons can be terrible infection vectors.  The only way to truly reduce that is with social distancing: Keeping people home as much as possible, for as long as possible until this recedes.  This has already been proven in the past. Namely, in the 1918 flu pandemic.  Learnings from the 1918 Flu Pandemic  You can see how Philadelphia didn’t act quickly, and had a massive peak in death rates. Compare that with St Louis, which did.  Then look at Denver, which enacted measures and then loosened them. They had a double peak, with the 2nd one higher than the first.  If you generalize, this is what you find:  This chart shows, for the 1918 flu in the US, how many more deaths there were per city depending on how fast measures were taken. For example, a city like St Louis took measures 6 days before Pittsburgh, and had less than half the deaths per citizen. On average, taking measures 20 days earlier halved the death rate.  Italy has finally figured this out. They first locked down Lombardy on Sunday, and one day later, on Monday, they realized their mistake and decided they had to lock down the entire country.  Hopefully, we will see results in the coming days. However, it will take one to two weeks to see. Remember the Wuhan graph: there was a delay of 12 days between the moment when the lockdown was announced and the moment when official cases orange started going down.  How Can Politicians Contribute to Social Distancing?  The question politicians are asking themselves today is not whether they should do something, but rather what’s the appropriate action to take.  There are several stages to control an epidemic, starting with anticipation and ending with eradication. But it’s too late for most options today. With this level of cases, the only options politicians have in front of them are containment, mitigation or suppression.  Containment  Containment is making sure all the cases are identified, controlled, and isolated. It’s what Singapore, South Korea or Taiwan are doing so well: They very quickly limit people coming in, identify the sick, immediately isolate them, use heavy protective gear to protect their health workers, track all their contacts, quarantine them… This works extremely well when you’re prepared and you do it early on, and don’t need to grind your economy to a halt to make it happen.  I’ve already touted Taiwan’s approach. But China’s is good too. The lengths at which it went to contain the virus are mind-boggling. For example, they had up to 1,800 teams of 5 people each tracking every infected person, everybody they got interacted with, then everybody those people interacted with, and isolating the bunch. That’s how they were able to contain the virus across a billion-people country.  This is not what Western countries have done. And now it’s too late. The recent US announcement that most travel from Europe was banned is a containment measure for a country that has, as of today, 3 times the cases that Hubei had when it shut down, growing exponentially. How can we know if it’s enough? It turns out, we can know by looking at the Wuhan travel ban."
12,12,true/false,"Belgian government Minister Fremault announced that Brussels is halting their 5G plans due to the negative health effects. Celine Fremault, Minister of the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region Responsible For Housing, Quality Of Life, Environment And Energy released the statement in an interview with L’Echo: “I cannot welcome such technology if the radiation standards, which must protect the citizen, are not respected, 5G or not. The people of Brussels are not guinea pigs whose health I can sell at a profit. We cannot leave anything to doubt."" Minister Fremault accurately identified that the 5G pilot project will not be compatible with Belgian radiation safety standards of 9 V/m, or 95 mW/m2, and has stated that she will not be making an exception. In the guidelines the threshold for extreme concern is 1 mW/m2, however many government agencies still only consider thermal effects and profit rather than the cumulative body of the thousands of peer reviewed scientific studies. With Brussels heading up the EU, and with one of the 2 major 5G appeals being addressed to the EU officials officials they seem to be better informed and motivated to protect themselves in the EU. Hopefully support continues to build for Minister Celine Fremault and all officials who are hearing the call to sanity and plea of the people to prioritize their safety over the technocratic oligarchy. Perhaps officials in North America and elsewhere should take note and follow suit, after all that motivating profit will soon stop once more people get sick and can no longer spend money.

If you are in support of rolling out untested 5G please watch this 6 minute video: UN Staff Member: 5G Is War On Humanity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNZOtrAzJzg Industry commitment to study safety admitted to being zero: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekNC0J3xx1w&feature=youtu.be&t=156 Tom Wheeler FCC Chair press release on 5G rollout saying ..”we don’t believe we need to study it” and “won’t wait for the standards”, and warning to stay out of the way of progress: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMxfffqyDtc&feature=youtu.be&t=173 Without question 5G will place the world under unprecedented levels of control and surveillance, let alone the health impacts for all manners of life. This alone should be enough to delete the granting of the unheard of powers to the greedy soulless corporate algorithms, this entire situation should be filed under an attempt of useful technology gone bad for profit and control. The question that should be really be asked by everyone is does 5G pose a threat to all biological life? It hasn’t been fully tested, and the results of independent evidence is overwhelmingly suggesting that yes 5G dose pose a major threat. That is unless you ask the telecommunications networks and the agencies and officials within their deep pockets who release untruths, withhold information, and attempt to quash pushback. In a US senate hearing the wireless industry even brashly admitted they have not done any safety studies and don’t plan to. Hundreds of scientists are trying to sound the alarm and raise the red flags. Dr. Martin Pall has conducted research that has laid out the mechanisms of how wireless radiation causes harm in our cells, and calls 5G “the stupidest idea in the history of the world.” Unfortunately those deep pockets of the telecommunications giants run deep and wide, within corporatized halls of government full of lobbyists that drown out the voice of reason with dreams of grandeur, control and greed for the unprecedented economic opportunities of the full on commercial exploitation of reality for even more profit and deprivation among these agenda pushers stuck in hive mind states blinded by the control and dollar signs obsessions, who are at the very least incapable of seeing where all this is heading and what will happen to them, their families, and all life on Earth. All of the industry and its sheepeople are being presented with scientific evidence of this catastrophe in the making, and being asked to wait for testing before forcing 5G upon the world. Yet they are refusing to listen and continue towing their control and profit pushing line. Why is this being allowed, how can it be ignored unless they have a dark agenda that includes a shadow of expression for an utter disdain for life. Perhaps even at the core of this desire lays an agenda to exit the human condition via AI and transhumanism seeking escape through technology rather than humanity and connection with divinity. Why else would this be pushed for so hard, untested, at all costs, ignoring the plea of science, it does make one wonder. To any sane person with normal values this 5G situation is to say the least bewildering and alarming. Perhaps with current connectedness we can help other become aware and work together to find a solution and choice for a positive future and push back against 5G. Brussels is the first major international to block 5G, dozens of others have passed legislation to prevent or restrict 5G rollouts due to health effects. Environmental Health Trusts lists legislation from 21 local governments within the USA, on March 13, 2019 Portland demanded the FCC update its research on health and the environmental impacts of 5G. Support local attempts to get the powers that be to listen. EMF Safety Network; My Street, My Choice; and WhatIs5G.info are websites that provide guidelines for how to help put the brakes on 5G where you live until it can be properly tested: The South Pole, the most isolated part of the planet, is also one of the most rapidly warming ones, scientists said Monday, with surface air temperatures rising since the 1990s at a rate that is three times faster than the global average. While the warming could be the result of natural climate change alone, the researchers said, it is likely that the effects of human-caused warming contributed to it. The pole, home to a United States research base in the high, icy emptiness of the Antarctic interior, warmed by about 0.6 degrees Celsius, or 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit, per decade over the past 30 years, the researchers reported in a paper published in Nature Climate Change. The global average over that time was about 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade. Although parts of coastal Antarctica are losing ice, which contributes to sea level rise, the pole is in no danger of melting, as the year-round average temperature is still about minus-50 degrees Celsius. But the finding shows that no place is unaffected by change on a warming planet."
13,13,true/false,"A woman who used to self-harm because of her size 30 frame said her husband loves her body A ’super-fat' woman has learned to love her curves, with the help of her husband.  Amalie Jennings, originally from Denmark, moved to Hertfordshire to be with her British husband Sean.  The 25-year-old has spent most of her life hating her body, which resulted in her self-harming, but she now embraces her size 30 frame.  Most people in the couple's lives have been accepting of their 'mixed weight relationship', however they have had to cut contact with Sean's father, although they've not revealed the exact circumstances.  Amalie Jennings, 25, (pictured) used to hate her body, but thanks to her husband Sean (right), she learned to finally love herself. Pictured: The couple at their home in Hertfordshire  Amalie and Sean met online in 2008 and dated long distance for nine years. Amalie could not believe Sean kept talking to her after seeing what she looked like  'I have always been fat since I was two years old. My mum took me to the doctors because I was gaining a lot of weight,' Amalie said.  'Since as long as I can remember I have been fat. And of course that comes with a lot of bullying, a lot of picking on. My oldest memory of bullying is in Kindergarten, I was around four. And all the kids picked on me for being fat.  'I gained even more weight, which meant I was picked on even more. I started self-harming and I got picked on again. I just had a really horrible self-image, I hated looking at the mirror.  'I hated wearing or picking out clothes because nothing would fit me as a child - I had to shop in the woman’s department to get things that would fit.  'I could never wear what my friends wore or what’s in fashion at the time because nothing would fit me.'  Pictured: Sean and Amalie on their wedding day, two years ago. Amalie is now confident about her body  The happy couple posing for pictures in their living-room. Sean (pictured) said he does not have a fetish for fat women, but was attracted to Amalie because he loved her  Amalie first started to recognise that her body shape wasn’t accepted by society when she started reading books.  She said: 'When I was growing up I always loved reading books but there was never people like me. Not even just women, there was never people in them like my size.'  But all of that changed when Amalie met her husband Sean via an online video game in 2008.  She told BTV: 'My husband Sean and I met 11 years ago on a game on the PlayStation. And it was kind of a weird friendship that started, I thought he was an old man just looking for a young woman to talk to but then I learned he is my age.  Amalie pictured as a child. She's struggled with her weight since childhood and used to be badly bullied because of it  'And the thing about online relationships you get to know a person in a different way. Of course we had seen pictures of each other but it took a while for us to cam.  'You could see how fat I was in the pictures but he kept talking to me. I was so insecure about myself, I would hide my double chin.  'But he still didn’t care, he just wanted to talk to me. So we became best friends really fast, and it actually took a while before we realised we were in love with each other. I started giving him hints that I liked him but he didn’t pick up on them.'  Amalie would even post poems on her Facebook profile hinting at her love for Sean – but while he would read them and compliment Amalie on her poems he didn’t realise she was writing about him.  Finally she plucked up the courage to tell Sean the extent of her feelings, only to learn her felt the same way too.  She said: 'It was the weirdest feeling because I haven’t had luck with boyfriends before. And finally there’s this guy, 500 miles away who fancies me as much as I fancy him.  The couple live together in Hertfordshire and want to challenge the stigmas surrounding fatphobia and mixed-weight relationships  Amalie and Sean started dating long distance, visiting each other for nine years, and finally marrying on a beach two years ago.  Sean told BTV: 'I wouldn’t say I am generally attracted to larger women, I am attracted to people that I love really so it just happened.  'I mean, maybe in my head before we met, it wouldn't have been someone as large. But it just happened to be and it is not that I find her any less attractive necessarily.  Amalie added: 'It's never been like a fat fetish thing but you haven't like obsessively said ""Oh, I love your fat stomach"" and stuff like that.  'The thing with weight differences in relationships is there always will be people who comment, ""Why would you be with them? Why would you be with that kind of person?""  Amalie as a child. She said that as she's grown older, she's realised that while she can't stop people judging her and looking at her, she is able to stop caring about their opinions  'Because there is this image that a fat person has to be with a fat person and a thin person has to be with a thin person. I would like more people to come out and be proud of their partner, be proud of themselves.'  Amalie wants to highlight issues that surround fatphobia in the medical field too.  She said: 'There’s a lot of that phobia in the medical field. And that’s what gets me, I don’t feel safe going to the doctors anymore, because you can go in with a broken arm and you will be told you should lose weight.'  'I am happy in my body and I am happy with who I am and what I look like, and I don’t want to fall into the pressure of having to lose weight to be accepted by everyone else.  'If I was ever to go back and speak to a younger Amalie I would say stop wasting time hating yourself. Yes your body is different but it doesn’t mean that it’s a bad body.  'You will never be able to stop people saying things about you. You will never be able to stop them looking at you, but you can stop letting it affect you. You also need to know that you will find people who love you, who love your body for what it is.'"

The new report comes as the Trump administration makes it harder for Central Americans to seek refuge here. (AP Photo/Eduardo Verdugo, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — At least 138 people deported to El Salvador from the United States in recent years were subsequently killed, Human Rights Watch says in a report that comes as the Trump administration makes it harder for Central Americans to seek refuge here.  A majority of the deaths documented by Human Rights Watch in the report Wednesday occurred less than a year after the deportees returned to El Salvador; some were within days. The organization also confirmed at least 70 cases of sexual assault or other violence following their arrival in the country.  The violence underscores the risk faced by people forced to return by U.S. law that mandates deportation of noncitizens convicted of a range of crimes and Trump administration policies that discourage asylum-seekers, said Alison Leal Parker, the group’s U.S. managing director.  ADVERTISEMENT  “Our concern is that many of these people are facing a death sentence,” Parker said.  Between 2014 and 2018 the U.S. deported about 111,000 Salvadorans back to their homeland, which has long been in the grip of fierce gang violence.  The. United Nations reported last year that killings in El Salvador, a majority of them linked to gang conflict, have declined from a peak of more than 6,000 in 2015. But the country still has one of the highest homicide rates in the world.  Meanwhile, the number of Salvadorans seeking asylum in the United States grew by nearly 1,000% between 2012 and 2017, many citing threats from gangs. Only about 18% are granted asylum.  Human Rights Watch confirmed the 138 deaths during that period through official records, interviews with families and media accounts but believes the actual toll is much higher, in part because some aren’t recorded due to the stigma of having been deported from the U.S. The number of assaults is likely low also because of under-reporting in the country of 6.5 million.  El Salvador’s foreign ministerm Alexandra Hill Tinocom told reporters that at least some of those killed were gang members, though she conceded that deportees do face stigma in the country.  She blamed gang rivalries for the violence that plagues the country, and avoided a direct answer when asked about allegations in the report that police officers have killed deportees who are suspected gang members.  “Look, we have to take everything in context,” she said. “Gangs kill children, they dismember people, they terrorize communities and we are working hard, very hard against them.”  The deaths tracked in the study occurred under both the Trump and Obama administrations. President Donald Trump has made immigration enforcement a centerpiece of his administration, and that has included a policy of forcing asylum-seekers from Central America to wait in Mexico while their claims are evaluated and be sent back to their homelands if their claim is rejected.  Many of those asylum-seekers could previously have been released on parole in the United States for a decision that could take a year or more. The Department of Homeland Security says it’s trying to make the process more efficient and crack down on fraudulent claims.  “This report is a shameful reminder of the Trump administration’s xenophobic policy of denying meaningful protection to vulnerable families fleeing a certain death in their home countries,” said Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., in a statement.  Parker and other critics of the administration’s immigration policy say this report, and previous efforts that have documented violence against Salvadorans waiting in Mexican border towns for their claims to be processed, show the risks of the Trump administration policy.  Full Coverage: El Salvador  “We are deeply concerned by the Trump administration’s effort to literally eviscerate the right to seek asylum in the United States,” she said.  Human Rights Watch urged the administration to repeal the policy that requires asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico along with the agreements that allow Guatemalans, Salvadorans and Hondurans to be settled in other countries of Central America while seeking refuge. They also want the attorney general to reverse restrictions that made it harder for them to claim U.S. asylum because of threats posed by gangs or gender-based violence.  ___  Associated Press writer Marcos Aleman in San Salvador, El Salvador, contributed to this report."
15,15,true/false,"Bill Gates: America’s Top Farmland Owner The cofounder of Microsoft ranks as America’s largest private farmland owner. By Eric O’Keefe Call it a hunch, but the story did not jibe.

By Eric O’Keefe  Call it a hunch, but the story did not jibe. I scanned the headline for the umpteenth time and then read and reread the pertinent details. Something was missing. Either that or I had a screw loose. According to reporting by Wendy Culverwell in the Tri-City Herald, a 14,500-acre swath of choice Eastern Washington farmland in the Horse Heaven Hills of Benton County had just traded hands for almost $171 million. That’s a ginormous deal, one that pencils out to almost $12,000 per acre for a whole lot of acres. Pretty pricey dirt, right? That’s exactly what I thought. Especially when it comes to row crops like sweet corn and wheat, which are grown in rotation with potatoes on 100 Circles, which is the name of the property that changed hands. Then again, farmers and investors in the Mid-Columbia River market expect to pay $10,000 to $15,000 for good ground. Anyone who has ever studied the Columbia River Basin knows that the tillable acreage there is coveted ground, a geologic wonder. The soil profile and underlying silty loess are in a league of their own.  I had gained this smidgen of geologic proficiency while researching our 2018 Farmland Deal of the Year, Weidert Farm, in neighboring Walla Walla County. One of the most telling moments in the field that summer came when a soil scientist by the name of Alan Busacca grabbed a shovel and stepped into a 10-foot trench that had been ripped open on the farm by a Caterpillar 336. Dusky layers of silt and sand towered over the 6-foot-tall retired Washington State professor. There wasn’t a rock, let alone a pebble, or even a root to be seen in the soil. Busacca was in his element: It was some of the richest farmland in the Lower 48. And from an agricultural perspective, the region surrounding Walla Walla and the Horse Heaven Hills has evolved into a commercial hub, complete with controlled atmosphere (CA) storage, state-of-the-art transportation infrastructure, and ready access to low-cost hydropower.  These are a few of the reasons why savvy investors have been plowing millions of dollars into farmland on both the Oregon and the Washington sides of the Columbia River Gorge. At current valuations, it’s one of the nation’s best farmland opportunities. In 2018, when 100 Circles sold, it was even better.  More often than not, farmland sales involve hundreds of acres. Thousand-acre transactions — such as the sale of 6,000- acre Weidert Farm to Farmland L.P. two years ago and the 6,175-acre Broetje Orchards acquisition by the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan last year — are blue-moon events.  Tens of thousands of acres? Only sovereign wealth funds and institutional investors can stroke a check for tracts in that league, which is exactly what occurred on the sell side of the 100 Circles transaction: The seller was John Hancock Life Insurance, a multibillion-dollar asset manager with key holdings in all the major US markets as well as Canada and Australia.  The story went dark on the buy side, however. The Tri-City Herald reported that the purchaser was a “Louisiana investor,” a limited liability company associated with Angelina Agriculture of Monterey, Louisiana. Sorry, but that didn’t pass the sniff test.  The Land Report tracks numerous Louisiana landowners; Angelina Agriculture is not one of them. Let’s call that strike one. The burgeoning metropolis of Monterey, population 462, rang a bell, but despite my best efforts, I couldn’t connect the dots to anyone whom we had profiled in The Land Report or, for that matter, anyone who was on our watch list. So I took a look at Dun & Bradstreet. At its listed headquarters — 8318 Highway 565 — Angelina Agriculture boasted two employees and reported annual revenues just north of $300,000. Given the size and cost of 100 Circles, both of those figures made no sense at all. Strike two. How about Google Maps? An aerial image of the Highway 565 address revealed a small metal-sided building off by itself in the woods. Strike three, right?  One of my favorite Clint Eastwood movies is the 1999 mystery/thriller True Crime. In it, the four-time Academy Award winner plays an over-the-hill journalist who has “a nose” for a story. I am quite confident that Eastwood’s character, Steve Everett, would have picked up the stench from this setup a mile off: a $171 million acquisition by an LLC with two employees in a metal-sided building down a dirt road off the Bayou Cocodrie? I forwarded the lead to our Land Report 100 Research Team. Minutes later, a terse response arrived:  “Ever hear of Bill Gates?”  THE PAPER TRAIL  Actually, when it comes to the extensive farmland portfolio of Bill and Melinda Gates, the question should be, “Ever hear of Michael Larson?” For the last 25 years, the Claremont McKenna College alum has managed the Gateses’ personal portfolio as well as the considerable holdings of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. (Although our researchers identified dozens of different entities that own the Gateses’ assets, Larson himself operates primarily through an entity called Cascade Investment LLC.)  In 1994, the Gateses hired the former Putnam Investments bond-fund manager to diversify the couple’s portfolio away from the Microsoft co-founder’s 45 percent stake in the technology giant while maintaining comparable or better returns. According to a 2014 profile of Larson in the Wall Street Journal, these investments include a substantial stake in AutoNation, hospitality interests such as the Charles Hotel in Cambridge and the Four Seasons in San Francisco, and “at least 100,000 acres of farmland in California, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, and other states … .” According to the Land Report 100 Research Team, that figure is currently more than twice that amount, which means Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, has an alter ego: Farmer Bill, the guy who owns more farmland than anyone else in America.  The Gateses’ largest single block of dirt was acquired in 2017: a group of farmland assets owned by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Based in Toronto, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board began assembling an agricultural portfolio in 2013, when it acquired AgCoA, aka, Agricultural Company of America. This private US farmland REIT was a joint venture between Duquesne Capital Management and Goldman Sachs that launched in 2007. Over the next five years, AgCoA acquired more than 100,000 acres in nine states. By the time it was sold to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board in 2013, AgCoA ranked as one of the leading institutional owners of row crop farmland in the US.  After AgCoA, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board acquired a second tranche of farmland assets when it paid $2.5 billion for a 40 percent stake in Glencore Agricultural Products in 2016. The very next year, however, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board began shedding these very same farmland assets as quickly as it had acquired them. And it did this so quietly one might even say it was done in secret.  There was no public announcement, and no notice in the business press. Instead, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board revealed in the fine print of a quarterly statement that it had sold $520 million in US farmland assets held by Agriculture Company of America. Credit Chris Janiec at Agri Investor for this eagle-eyed investigating. The Americas Editor at Agri Investor, Janiec reported that the assets had been offered as a single block and “that Microsoft founder Bill Gates is thought to be the buyer of CPPIB’s farmland.” Janiec stayed on the story, and the following year, he confirmed the parameters of sale when he reported the addition of 61 properties valued at approximately $500 million to the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries’ (NCREIF) US Farmland Index. This half-billion-dollar figure corroborated the AgCoA acquisition, and the paper trail led directly to Cascade Investment LLC.  All told, the 2017 acquisition of AgCoA and the 2018 acquisition of the 100 Circles tract in the Horse Heaven Hills of Eastern Washington total an investment in farmland assets of more than $690 million. Janiec’s sources said some of the AgCoA assets were quickly sold off, but according to the Land Report 100 Research Team, an estimated 242,000 acres of farmland remained.  Yet farmland assets aren’t the sole component of the Gateses’ landholdings. In 2017, Cascade Investment bought a “significant stake” in 24,800 acres of transitional land on the western edge of Phoenix, the most populous city in Arizona and the 10th largest metropolitan area in the country. The acreage sits off Interstate 10, and it is poised to be accessible by Interstate 11, a proposed highway that would traverse 5 miles of the 40-square-mile holding. At buildout, the Belmont development will create a brand-new metropolis, one similar in size to the Phoenix suburb of Tempe, home to Arizona State University and almost 200,000 residents. According to The Arizona Republic, Belmont is projected to include up to 80,000 homes; 3,800 acres of industrial, office, and retail space; 3,400 acres of open space; and 470 acres for public schools.  Cascade Investment doubled down on Phoenix transitional land two years later when it made a second major investment by acquiring more than 2,800 acres known as Spurlock Ranch in Buckeye for $25 million.  SUSTAINABLE INVESTING  A spokesman for Cascade Investment declined to comment on any of the details associated with these transactions or the Gateses’ holdings, other than to say that Cascade is very supportive of sustainable farming.  Much like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation uses science and technology to achieve a number of worthy goals — including transitioning millions of people out of poverty, improving people’s health and well-being, and ensuring that all people have access to opportunities necessary to succeed in school and in life — Cascade’s farmland holdings also aim to further laudable objectives.  In January 2020, The Land Report announced the launch of a sustainability standard that was developed by US farmland owners and operators. Called Leading Harvest, the organization’s goal is to create a sustainability standard that can be implemented across the greatest swath of agricultural acreage. Currently, more than 2 million acres in 22 states and an additional 2 million acres in seven countries are represented. Among the participants in the 13-member Sustainable Agriculture Working Group are Ceres Partners, Hancock Natural Resources Group, The Rohaytn Group, and UBS Farmland Investors.  Not surprisingly, one of Leading Harvest’s other inaugural members is a Cascade entity called Cottonwood Ag Management. Committing the resources to launch this all-important standard validates the assertion that Cascade supports sustainable strategies that advance resiliency and efficiency, retain talent, and reduce regulatory burdens.  Although the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has no ties whatsoever to Cascade or its investments, it also has a farmland initiative: Gates Ag One, which has established its headquarters in the Greater St. Louis area. According to the St. Louis Business Journal, Gates Ag One will focus on research that helps “smallholder farmers adapt to climate change and make food production in low- and middle-income countries more productive, resilient, and sustainable.”  A CLOSING NOTE  Remember that metal-sided building down near the Bayou Cocodrie? Turns out that very same property had caught my eye way back when The Land Report was preparing to launch in 2006. Does the name Bernie Ebbers ring a bell? Once upon a time, the business press dubbed the colorful entrepreneur “the telecom cowboy.” That was before the Edmonton native was put on trial for his role in what was, at the time, the largest corporate bankruptcy filing in US history.  In 2005, the former WorldCom CEO was convicted of securities fraud, conspiracy, and filing false reports that were instrumental in WorldCom’s $11 billion dollar accounting fraud. After losing his appeal in 2006, Ebbers spent most of the rest of his life in a federal prison before being granted compassionate release by a federal judge in 2020. He died at home surrounded by his family.  Ebbers was many things — a dreamer, a liar, a swindler — and he loved land. In 1998 when he was the toast of Wall Street, the telecom cowboy paid British Columbia’s Woodward family the astronomical sum of $73 million for Canada’s largest ranch: 500,000-acre Douglas Lake, a 22,000-head cattle operation. Ebbers subsequently pledged Douglas Lake as collateral for $400 million he ended up borrowing from WorldCom, and in 2003, WorldCom sold Douglas Lake to Kroenke Ranches. The $68.5 million that Kroenke Ranches paid was applied to Ebbers’s IOU. He also owned a 26,236-acre Louisiana farm. It, too, was sold, on September 25, 2006, the day before Ebbers began serving his sentence at the Oakdale Federal Correctional Institution. It was his last deal as a free man.  When Ebbers owned this Louisiana farm, it was known as Angelina Plantation. And its headquarters was in — you guessed it — Monterey, Louisiana. That was the missing piece of the puzzle I had been searching for as I read the Tri-City Herald story. In a former life, Angelina Agriculture, the purchaser that paid $171 million for 100 Circles in 2018, was, in fact, Bernie Ebbers’s Angelina Plantation. The day before he went to prison, Ebbers sold Angelina for $32 million. The farm was subsequently sold to AgCoA, which was acquired by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. In 2017, Angelina Plantation changed hands one more time and became one of the principal farmland assets in the Gateses’ Cascade Investment’s portfolio.  It took a dozen years, but the ownership of that Louisiana farmland went from Bernie Ebbers to Bill Gates with a couple of stops in between. I readily admit forgetting where and when I first caught wind of it, but the moment I read that Tri-City Herald story, I knew the ending definitely needed a rewrite. Steve Everett would be proud.  This article was updated to credit Wendy Culverwell as the reporter who broke the story of the Horse Heaven Hills transaction in the Tri-City Herald."
16,16,true/false,"New York, Chicago promise court fight if Trump sends in unidentified federal agents (Reuters) - The mayors of New York City and Chicago said on Tuesday they would take President Donald Trump to court if he sent unidentified U.S. government agents to police their cities, pushing back on a threat that has sparked widespread controversy over the use of federal force.  But Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot also said she would accept an influx of FBI agents and other identified law enforcement officials from the Trump administration, an acknowledgement of the scale of gun violence and other crimes plaguing her city.  Lightfoot and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio spoke a day after Trump said he would send law enforcement to several cities including Baltimore, Chicago, New York and Philadelphia to crack down on protests against racism and police brutality ignited by George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis police custody on May 25.  A Republican, Trump made a point of saying the mayors of the cities on his list were liberal Democrats, underpinning concerns the threat was politically motivated. Federal agents last week were dispatched to counter protests in Portland, Oregon, where protesters have complained of agents making arrests without identifying themselves and using unmarked rental cars.  Opinion polls show Trump trails Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the run-up to a Nov. 3 presidential election. Trump has sought to make a crackdown a campaign issue, taking the spotlight off his response to the coronavirus pandemic, a weak point for him in the polls.  De Blasio said Trump’s threat was likely bluster, but added that he would challenge any deployment in the courts. He said the actions of unidentified officers grabbing citizens in Portland “appeared to violate basic constitutional rights.”  “This president blusters and bluffs and says he’s going to do things and they never materialize on a regular basis, so we should not overrate his statements, they are so often not true.”  Lightfoot said on Tuesday that she had been told that no unidentified officers would be deployed. The Chicago Tribune had reported on Monday that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees the forces in Portland, would deploy 150 agents to help tamp down violence in the city.  “Unfortunately there’s been a lot of saber rattling about that coming from the president and members of his team,” Lightfoot told reporters. “What I understand at this point, and I caveat that, is that the Trump administration is not going to actually deploy unnamed agents in the streets of Chicago.”  FILE PHOTO: New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio speaks to people as he gives away face masks for using on public spaces to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the Queens borough of New York City, U.S., May 16, 2020 REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz/File Photo  Instead, Lightfoot said reinforcements would come from the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and “plug into” federal agencies already coordinating with the city on crime.  50 NIGHTS OF PROTEST  The Portland protests have gone on for more than 50 nights. On Monday, video showed federal agents firing tear gas, protesters pulling down fencing around the federal courthouse, and hundreds of people dressed in yellow who said they were mothers and fathers demanding the agents withdraw.  DHS has placed about 2,000 officials from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and other agencies on standby for possible deployment to cities, the New York Times reported.  A CBP official told Reuters that officers from three border units in paramilitary-type operations had been deployed to Portland. It was unclear whether officers had been deployed to other cities.  White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told a briefing on Tuesday that dispatching agents was justified by a federal statute empowering the secretary of Homeland Security to deputize agents to protect federal property and people on that property.  At a separate briefing, acting Homeland Security secretary Chad Wolf said his agents were properly identifying themselves in Portland. “We are only targeting and arresting those who have been identified as committing crime,” Wolf said.  However, legal experts said there were limits to Trump’s power and that he could be challenged in court. “The president is not the king,” said Kent Greenfield, a Boston College law professor.  Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum sued the Department of Homeland Security last week and asked a federal judge to grant a temporary order blocking its officers from what she called unlawful detentions that lacked probable cause.  Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said he would criminally charge any federal agents who arrested citizens without probable cause or restrained them unlawfully. He said he saw potential crimes by agents in video footage from Portland.  But Krasner said he was skeptical that Trump would actually send agents to Philadelphia. He said the city’s protests had been peaceful. “Let us not take these fluffy words and act like they are more than they really are,” he said. “It’s really just bluster.”"
17,17,true/false,"Scientists are working on vaccines that spread like a disease. What could possibly go wrong? A worker conducts testing during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Liberia. Credit: John Saindon/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CC BY 2.0.  Once a COVID-19 vaccine is approved for public use, officials around the world will face the monumental challenge of vaccinating billions of people, a logistical operation rife with thorny ethical questions. What if instead of orchestrating complicated and resource-intensive campaigns to vaccinate humans against emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19, we could instead stop the zoonotic diseases that sometimes leap from animals to people at their source? A small, but growing number of scientists think it’s possible to exploit the self-propagating properties of viruses and use them to spread immunity instead of disease. Can we beat viruses like SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus, at their own game?  A virus that confers immunity throughout an animal population as it spreads in the wild could theoretically stop a zoonotic spillover event from happening, snuffing out the spark that could ignite the next pandemic. If the wild rats that host the deadly Lassa virus, for example, are vaccinated, the risks of a future outbreak among humans could be reduced. For at least 20 years, scientists have been experimenting with such self-spreading vaccines, work that continues to this day, and which has gained the attention of the US military.  For obvious reasons, public and scientific interest in vaccines is incredibly high, including in self-spreading vaccines, as they could be effective against zoonotic threats. The biologists Scott Nuismer and James Bull generated fresh media attention to self-spreading vaccines over the summer after publishing an article in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. But the subsequent reporting on the topic gives short shrift to the potentially significant downsides to releasing self-spreading vaccines into the environment.  Self-spreading vaccines could indeed entail serious risks, and the prospect of using them raises challenging questions.  Who decides, for instance, where and when a vaccine should be released? Once released, scientists will no longer be in control of the virus. It could mutate, as viruses naturally do. It may jump species. It will cross borders. There will be unexpected outcomes and unintended consequences. There always are.  While it may turn out to be technically feasible to fight emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19, AIDS, Ebola, and Zika with self-spreading viruses, and while the benefits may be significant, how does one weigh those benefits against what may be even greater risks?  How they work. Self-spreading vaccines are essentially genetically engineered viruses designed to move through populations in the same way as infectious diseases, but rather than causing disease, they confer protection. Built on the chassis of a benign virus, the vaccines have genetic material from a pathogen added to them that stimulates the creation of antibodies or white blood cells in “infected” hosts.  These vaccines could be particularly useful, some scientists say, for wildlife populations where direct vaccination is difficult due to issues like inaccessible habitats, poor infrastructure, high costs, or lack of resources. The idea, essentially, is to vaccinate a small proportion of a population through direct inoculation. These so-called founders will then passively spread the vaccine to other animals they encounter either by touch, sex, nursing, or breathing the same air. Gradually, these interactions could build up population-level immunity.  Self-spreading vaccines have some of their roots in efforts to reduce pest populations. Australian researchers described a virally spread immunocontraception, which hijacked the immune systems of infected animals—in this case a non-native mouse species in Australia—and prevented them from fertilizing offspring. The earliest self-spreading vaccine efforts targeted two highly lethal infectious diseases in the European rabbit population (myxoma virus and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus). In 2001, Spanish researchers field-tested a vaccine in a wild rabbit population living on Isla del Aire, a small Spanish island just off Menorca. The vaccine spread to more than half the 300 rabbits on the island, and the trial was deemed a success.  In 2015, another team of researchers speculated on the development of a self-spreading vaccine for the Ebola virus that could be used on wild great apes like chimpanzees. Since then, scientists have come to see a wide array of animals—from wildlife such as bats, birds, and foxes to domesticated animals like dogs, pigs, and sheep—as amenable to self-spreading vaccines.  So far, researchers have not developed experimental self-spreading vaccines for humans; there is no clear evidence that anybody is actively working on the technology. Nuismer and Bull argue, rather, that self-spreading vaccines present a revolutionary approach to control emerging infectious diseases before they even spill over from animals into the human population.  Zoonotic spillover is certainly a pressing problem; alongside SARS-CoV-2, HIV, Ebola virus, and the Zika virus, there are over a thousand other new viruses with zoonotic potential that have been detected in wild animals over the last decade. Prevention is better than a cure, Nuismer and Bull say in a New Scientist article. In their Nature Ecology & Evolution article, they claim they are “poised to begin developing self-disseminating vaccines to target a wide range of human pathogens” in animals.  Outside of an experiment, scientists would face massive technical and practical hurdles in identifying the most appropriate targets for intervention and ensuring immunity is maintained in the wildlife populations. Despite these substantial challenges, the potential security implications of self-spreading vaccines are even more serious.  The principal security concern is that of dual-use. In essence, this means that the same research that is used to develop self-spreading vaccines to prevent disease, could also be used to deliberately cause harm. You could, for instance, engineer triggers into a virus that cause immune system failures in infected people or animals, a bit like HIV does naturally. Or you could create triggers in a virus that cause a harmful autoimmune response, where the body starts attacking its own healthy cells and tissues.  The bioweapon question. While researchers may intend to make self-spreading vaccines, others could repurpose their science and develop biological weapons. Such a self-spreading weapon may prove uncontrollable and irreversible.  We don’t have to dig very deep for a historical example of weaponized biology. As the apartheid-era South African biowarfare program shows, social, political, and scientific pressures can lead to the misuse of biological innovation.  Codenamed Project Coast, South Africa’s program was primarily focused on covert assassination weapons for use against individuals deemed a threat to the racist apartheid government. In addition to producing contraptions to inject poisons, Project Coast researchers developed techniques to lace sugar cubes with salmonella and cigarettes with Bacillus anthracis.  While there have been many biowarfare programs, including several that were far more elaborate and sophisticated, the South African program is particularly relevant in thinking through malicious uses of self-spreading vaccines. One of Project Coast’s research projects aimed at developing a human anti-fertility vaccine.  The idea took hold during a time of widespread concern over worldwide population explosion. Schalk Van Rensburg, who oversaw fertility-related work at a Project Coast laboratory, told South Africa’s post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a forum for examining the sordid history of the era and laying the foundation for future peace and tolerance, that he thought the project was in line with the World Health Organization’s attempts to curb rising global birth rates. He believed it could bring his lab international acclaim and funding. According to Van Rensburg, Wouter Basson, the director of the biowarfare program, said the military needed an anti-fertility vaccine so that female soldiers would not fall pregnant.  While some of the scientists involved in the project denied awareness of ulterior intentions or even that their fertility work was part of a military endeavor, Van Rensburg and Daniel Goosen, a lab director, told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that the real intention behind the project was to selectively administer the contraceptive in secret to unwitting Black South African women.  In the end, the anti-fertility vaccine was not produced before Project Coast was officially closed down in 1995, 12 years after it was initiated. An early version was tested in baboons, but never in humans. South Africa isn’t the only country to try and forcibly sterilize parts of its population. European countries, including Sweden and Switzerland, sterilized members of the Roma minority in the early half of the 20th century and some, like Slovakia, continued even beyond that. More recently, analysts have alleged that the Chinese government is sterilizing women in Xinjiang, a province with a large population of Uighur Muslims.  It doesn’t take a massive leap of the imagination to see how the aims of South Africa’s anti-fertility vaccine project would have benefited from research into self-spreading vaccines, particularly if you combine it with current developments in pharmacogenomics, drug development, and personalized medicine. Taken together, these strands of research could help enable ultra-targeted biological warfare.  An expanding potential for abuse. The Biological Weapons Convention, the treaty that bans biological weapons, is nearly 50 years old. Negotiated and agreed to in the depths of the Cold War, the convention suffers from outdated modes of operation. There are also significant compliance assessment challenges. The convention certainly didn’t stop South Africa from pursuing Project Coast in the early 1980s.  Self-spreading vaccine research is a small but growing field. At the moment, about 10 institutions are doing significant work in the area. These laboratories are primarily located in the United States, but some are in Europe and Australia, as well. As the field expands, so does the potential for abuse.  So far research has primarily been bankrolled by US government science and health funders like the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Health and Human Services. Private organizations like the Gates Foundation and academic institutions have also financed projects. Recently, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), sometimes thought of as the US military’s research and development wing, has gotten involved in the research. The University of California, Davis, for example, is working on a DARPA administered project called Prediction of Spillover Potential and Interventional En Masse Animal Vaccination to Prevent Emerging Pathogen Threats in Current and Future Zones of US Military Operation. According to a pamphlet, the project is “creating the world’s first prototype of a self-disseminating vaccine designed to induce a high level of herd immunity (wildlife population level protection) against Lassa virus … and Ebola.”  Military investment in biological innovation for defensive or protective purposes is permissible under the Biological Weapons Convention, but it can still send the wrong signals. It could cause countries to doubt one another’s intentions and lead to tit-for-tat investment in potentially risky research, including in self-spreading vaccines. The result of research gone awry or biowarfare could be catastrophic for health and the environment.  At a time when the norm against chemical weapons is degrading, underscored most recently by the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny with the nerve agent Novichok—a crime for which many European officials blame Russia—the international community simply can’t afford to have the same thing happen to the norm against the use of biological weapons. It would completely defy the spirit of the treaty if it seemed like states would even want to pursue high-risk dual use activities in biology.  Early, open, good-faith conversations about scientific aims and advances that cause particular dual-use concerns, as self-spreading vaccines do, are essential to exploring the broader stakes of certain technical trajectories. The University of California, Davis program is pursuing ways to incorporate an “off switch” to safely control the technology. And DARPA says any field experimentation related to the project would follow biosafety protocols. But these pledges won’t suffice. Our ambition must be to make a collective decision about the technical pathways we are willing, or not willing, to take as a society."
18,18,true/false,"The global land and ocean temperature departure from average for May 2018 was the fourth highest for the month of May in the NOAA global temperature dataset record, which dates back to 1880. The March-May and year-to-date global temperatures were also the fourth warmest such periods on record.This monthly summary, developed by scientists at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, is part of the suite of climate services NOAA provides to government, business, academia and the public to support informed decision-making. May 2018 Temperature The May temperature across global land and ocean surfaces was 1.44°F above the 20th century average of 58.6°F and the fourth highest for May in the 1880-2018 record. The years 2014-2018 rank among the five warmest Mays on record, with 2016 the warmest May at 1.58°F above average. May 2018 also marks the 42nd consecutive May and the 401st consecutive month with temperatures, at least nominally, above the 20th century average. Record warmth was observed across parts of North America., Europe and Asia as well as the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. Record cold May temperatures were limited to northeastern Canada and the northern Atlantic Ocean, off the southern coast of Greenland. The May globally averaged land surface temperature was 2.05°F above the 20th century average of 52.0°F. This value was the smallest May temperature departure from average since 2011 and tied with 2013 as the seventh highest May land temperature in the 139-year record. The most notable warm land temperature departures from average during May 2018 were present across much of the contiguous U.S. and Europe, where temperatures were 5.4°F above average or higher. In contrast, the most notable cool land temperature departures from average were present across northeastern Canada and central Russia where temperatures were 5.4°F below average or lower. Europe had its warmest May since continental records began in 1910 at 4.97°F above average, surpassing the previous record set in 2003 by 1.66°F. May 2018 marked the first time in May that the continental temperature departure from average was 3.6°F (2.0°C) or higher. Several European countries had a record or near-record warm May temperature. Asia had its smallest May temperature departure from average since 2009. The May globally averaged sea surface temperature was 1.19°F above the 20th century monthly average of 61.3°F – also the fourth highest global ocean temperature for May in the record. The years 2014-2018 rank among the five warmest Mays on record, with 2016 the warmest May at 1.39°F above average. May 2018 Sea Ice. The May average Arctic sea ice extent was the second smallest in the 40-year record at 420,000 square miles (8.1 percent) below the 1981-2010 average, according to an analysis by the National Snow and Ice Data Center(link is external) using data from NOAA and NASA. Only the May Arctic sea ice extent in 2016 was smaller. The near-record low Arctic sea ice extent was mostly due to much-below-average sea ice in the Bering and Chukchi Seas. Antarctic sea ice extent during May was 330,000 square miles (8.6 percent) below the 1981-2010 average, the third smallest May extent on record. Antarctic sea ice expanded at a rate faster than average during May, with below-average ice coverage continuing for parts of the Weddell Sea. Seasonal (March-May 2018). The March-May average temperature across global land and ocean surfaces was 1.48°F above the 20th century average of 56.7°F and the fourth highest for March-May in the 1880-2018 record. This value was 0.45°F cooler than the record high set in 2016 and was the smallest March-May temperature departure from average since 2014. Record warm temperatures during the three-month period were present across parts of southern Europe, the Middle East, northeastern Africa, China, Mongolia, South America and the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. No land or ocean areas had record cold temperatures during March-May 2018. The globally averaged land surface temperature for March-May was 2.34°F above the 20th century average of 46.4°F. This value was the the fifth highest for March-May in the 139-year record. Five continents had a March-May 2018 temperature that ranked among the nine warmest such period since continental records began in 1910. Of note, Europe and South America had their third warmest March-May on record. The March-May globally averaged sea surface temperature was 1.15°F above the 20th century average of 61.0°F – also the fourth highest for March-May in the record. Year-to-Date (January-May 2018). The year-to-date temperature across global land and ocean surfaces was 1.39°F above the 20th century average of 55.5°F – tying with 2010 as the fourth highest for January-May in the 139-year record. The 2018 year-to-date value was 0.59°F lower than the record high set in 2016. The year-to-date globally averaged land surface temperature was 2.18°F above the 20th century average of 42.8°F. This value tied with 2002 as the fifth highest for January-May in the record. The year-to-date globally averaged sea surface temperature was 1.08°F above the 20th century average of 60.8°F. This was also the fifth highest for January-May in the 1880-2018 record. The number of white suspected terrorists being arrested in the UK has overtaken those of Asian appearance for the first time in more than a decade. Statistics released by the Home Office show an overall fall in terror arrests of 22 per cent in the year, with 351 made in the 12 months to the end of June. “The fall is partly due to a relatively large number of arrests being made following terrorist attacks in London and Manchester last year,” a report said. White suspects accounted for 38 per cent of terror-related arrests, followed by those of Asian appearance on 37 per cent and black suspects on 9 per cent. “This was the first time, since the year ending June 2005, that the proportion of white people arrested has exceeded the proportion of Asian people arrested,” the report said. “It was the second highest number of arrests of white people in a year since the data collection began in 2001.” The demographics of terrorists in prison, where Islamists make up the majority, is also changing, as the number of far-right extremists jailed rises.

Read our privacy notice The Home Office said: “The number of Islamist, extremist prisoners saw a slight decrease for the first time. ✕ Isis fighters in Afghanistan are communicating with UK terror cells, defence secretary Gavin Williamson says “The proportion of prisoners holding far-right ideologies has increased steadily over the past three years, with the number up from 10 to 28 in the latest year.” Terror arrests have risen significantly since Isis declared its so-called “state” across Syria and Iraq, causing at least 900 people to leave the UK for its territories and others, who remained in the country, arrested for raising money for the group, spreading its propaganda and planning to commit attacks. Then in 2016, National Action became the first far-right group to ever be declared a terrorist organisation in the UK, with waves of police raids targeting the neo-Nazis. Experts have warned of the threat of “reciprocal radicalisation”, where Islamists and the far-right feed off each other to drive support to their own ideologies. Since the Westminster attack in March 2017, security services have foiled 13 Islamist plots and four from the extreme right-wing, seeing numerous would-be killers jailed. Of the five attacks launched in London and Manchester last year, leaving a total of 36 victims dead, Isis claimed responsibility for four and one was carried out by a far-right extremist targeting Muslims. Islamists make up 82 per cent of terrorist prisoners, followed by 13 per cent far-right and the rest made up of other ideologies including links to Northern Ireland. Police leaders said the past year saw highest number of terrorists tried and successfully convicted, since data collection began in 2009. Life sentences were handed out in 10 cases, including for the men who mounted the Finsbury Park and Parsons Green terror attacks.

The number of active investigations being carried out by specialist police and the security services has reached it’s highest ever level, currently standing at more than 650 probes focusing on the “most dangerous individuals”. “Demands upon CT Policing have increased by about a third since the start of 2017,” said deputy assistant commissioner Haydon. “The step-change in terrorist activity is matched only by an increased effort from police and security services, and our officers are working incredibly hard to protect the public and to bring people to justice, which is evidenced by the impressive conviction rate achieved in the last year. “But I would also like to use this opportunity to remind the public that they, too, play a part in these successes. “Many of these arrests, convictions and investigations hinge upon vital information provided by members of the public.” The figures came as the government consults on new terror laws contained in the Counter Terrorism and Border Security Bill. If enacted, it could spark a dramatic increase in terror arrests, which are currently being made under two Terrorism Acts, by introducing new crimes. They include viewing terrorist propaganda online just once, entering “designated areas” abroad, and making “reckless” statements that could drive support for a banned group. People are urged to report suspicious activity online at www.gov.uk/ACT or via the confidential hotline on 0800 789 321."
19,19,true/false,"Obamacare will question your sex life May 18, 2011  -- Leroy Fick hit the jackpot. The Michigan man won $2 million in the state lottery's ""Make Me Rich"" contest last June. With the $850,000 he took home after taxes, Fick, 59, used his winnings to purchase a new home and a used Audi convertible. But to buy groceries, this lottery winner is still using his Bridge Card, Michigan's version of food stamps. How can a man who won millions in the lottery still use food stamps? His lawyer says it is perfectly legal. ""He's not trying to cheat the state,"" said Fick's attorney, John Wilson. ""Based on his income, he's eligible."" In fact, Fick said he contacted Michigan's Department of Human Services after his lottery win to ask if he could still use his Bridge Card. ""They said I could go ahead and keep the Bridge Card if I wanted to,"" said Fick. So, he did. ""He specifically called the Department of Human Services and said, 'Can I still use the Bridge Card?' and they said, 'Yes,' because he is eligible,"" said attorney Wilson. ""He's done everything right in the eyes of the law."" Michigan uses federal guidelines that base eligibility for food stamps solely on income. Fick's attorney said his client is unemployed and lives on Social Security disability benefits, so his income qualifies him for the Bridge Card. The $850,000 lump sum lottery payment is considered an asset -- not income. So, under state policy, Fick can legally get food stamps -- even if he has hundreds of thousands of dollars in the bank. ""This angers me. It really makes me angry,"" said Rep Charles Brunner, who represents Fick's hometown of Auburn in Michigan's 96th District. He is one of a number of lawmakers in a state battered by high unemployment and a whopping budget deficit now fuming over Michigan's lottery loophole. ""The thing that really bothers me is [that] in our state we have so many people out of work ... so many people in need of assistance, and for a lottery winner to get food stamps"" is unfair, Brunner said. ""If it's a glitch in the law, we've got to fix it now."" Today, Brunner introduced legislation in the Michigan House of Representatives calling for the state to factor in the assets of food stamp applicants, not just their income. Lawmakers are now scrambling to close that loophole. ""We are actively seeking a change to the food assistance policy to see that only those who are truly [in] need qualify,"" said Gisgie Gendreau, a spokeswoman for Michigan's Department of Human Services. Fick's attorney said his client will stop using his Bridge Card if Michigan changes its policy, and doesn't feel bad about using the taxpayer funded program because Fick just paid more than $1 million of his lottery winnings in state taxes. ""He feels like he's paid into the system,"" Wilson said. Even though his client won more money than many people earn in a lifetime, Wilson said Fick is not living like a millionaire. ""He lives a simple life,"" Wilson said. ""He doesn't even have the Internet."""
20,20,true/false,"US grants Pfizer Covid vaccine full approval, triggering new mandates The US Food and Drug Administration on Monday fully approved the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid shot, triggering a new wave of vaccine mandates as the Delta variant batters the country.  Around 52 percent of the American population is fully vaccinated, but health authorities have hit a wall of vaccine hesitant people, impeding the national campaign.  In a televised address, President Joe Biden called FDA approval the ""gold standard"" in evidence.  ""Today I'm calling on... more companies in the private sector to step up with vaccine requirements that will reach millions more people,"" he said.  Pfizer's vaccine, which will now be marketed under its brand name Comirnaty, is the first to receive full approval.  More than 200 million Pfizer shots have already been administered under an emergency use authorization (EUA) that was granted on December 11, 2020.  The decision to fully approve it among people aged 16 and up was based on updated data from the drug's clinical trial involving more than 40,000 people, which found the vaccine 91 percent effective in preventing Covid.  The FDA tracked data from 12,000 vaccine recipients six months out from their vaccine series.  Most commonly reported side effects were mild and included pain and swelling at the injection site as well as headache, chills and fever.  The agency is continuing to investigate safety data regarding the highly rare but more worrisome condition myocarditis (heart inflammation), particularly within seven days after the second dose.  The highest risk has been detected in boys aged 12 through 17, with available data suggesting most individuals recover but some require intensive care.  - Military, NYC announce mandates -  The US military said shortly after the announcement that it would mandate the vaccine, and a slew of private businesses and universities are expected to follow.  New York City also said it would require all its department of education employees to receive at least one dose of vaccine by September 27, without the option for regular testing instead.  Story continues  The vaccine remains available under emergency use authorization to children aged 12 to 15, but because it has now been fully approved, physicians may prescribe it to children under 12 if they believe it will be beneficial.  But Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock recommended against so called ""off-label"" use in younger children until clinical trials report their data, which is expected later this year.  ""We need to get the information and data on usage in younger children -- they are not just small adults,"" she told reporters, emphasizing that knowing the correct dosage for this group was key.  - Boost for vaccination campaign -  Experts hailed the development, which many had been urging for months.  Amesh Adalja of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security hailed the development as ""good news"" that may sway people still on the fence.  ""One of the talking points of the anti-vaccine movement which has falsely claimed that this was an 'experimental vaccine' has been removed,"" he told AFP.  Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, added he expected to see ""tens of millions more Americans vaccinated"" as a result of new mandates.  A recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found 30 percent of adults said full approval would make them more likely to get vaccinated.  The approval came as the ultra-contagious Delta variant pummels the country, with around 80,000 Americans hospitalized with Covid and more than 700 dying every day.  The hardest hit regions include southern states Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.  The vaccination rate has risen in these states in recent weeks, but the national rate is still well below its peak from spring.  Some 628,000 people have died from coronavirus infection in the United States, making it officially the hardest hit country in the world -- though experts say it is possible that India may in fact hold the record.  Vaccines are less effective against the Delta variant than they were against previous strains, particularly against infection, making the goal of high population level vaccination critical.  The Biden administration announced last week plans to make a booster shot immediately available for immuno-compromised people, and recommended all vaccinated people get a third shot eight months after their second.  ia/dw"

22,22,true/false,"First study of all Amazon greenhouse gases suggests the damaged forest is now worsening climate change The Amazon rainforest is most likely now a net contributor to warming of the planet, according to a first-of-its-kind analysis from more than 30 scientists.  For years, researchers have expressed concern that rising temperatures, drought, and deforestation are reducing the capacity of the world’s largest rainforest to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and help offset emissions from fossil-fuel burning. Recent studies have even suggested that some portions of the tropical landscape already may release more carbon than they store.  But the inhaling and exhaling of CO2 is just one way this damp jungle, the most species-rich on Earth, influences the global climate. Activities in the Amazon, both natural and human-caused, can shift the rainforest’s contribution in significant ways, warming the air directly or releasing other greenhouse gases that do.  Drying wetlands and soil compaction from logging, for example, can increase emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. Land-clearing fires release black carbon, small particles of soot that absorb sunlight and increase warmth. Deforestation can alter rainfall patterns, further drying and heating the forest. Regular flooding and dam-building releases the potent gas methane, as does cattle ranching, one chief reason forests are destroyed. And roughly 3.5 percent of all methane released globally comes naturally from the Amazon’s trees.  Yet no team had ever tried to assess the cumulative impact of these processes, even as the region is being rapidly transformed. The research, supported by the National Geographic Society and published today in Frontiers in Forests and Global Change, estimates that atmospheric warming from all of these sources combined now appears to swamp the forest’s natural cooling effect.  “Cutting the forest is interfering with its carbon uptake; that’s a problem,” says lead author Kristofer Covey, a professor of environmental studies at New York’s Skidmore College. “But when you start to look at these other factors alongside CO2, it gets really hard to see how the net effect isn’t that the Amazon as a whole is really warming global climate.”  The damage can still be reversed, he and his colleagues say. Halting global emissions from coal, oil, and natural gas would help restore balance, but curbing Amazon deforestation is a must, along with reducing dam building and increasing efforts to replant trees. Continuing to clear land at current rates appears certain to make warming worse for the entire world.  “We have this system that we have relied on to counter our mistakes, and we have really exceeded the capacity of that system to provide reliable service,” says co-author Fiona Soper, an assistant professor at McGill University.  A complicated ledger  The same richness that makes the Amazon so wonderfully biodiverse, home to tens of thousands of insects per square mile, makes understanding it extremely hard. Shimmering green leaves suck CO2 from the sky, converting it through photosynthesis into carbohydrates that end up in woody trunks and branches as trees grow. In trees and carbon-rich soils, the Amazon stores the equivalent of four or five years worth of human-made carbon emissions, up to 200 gigatons of carbon.  But the Amazon is also super wet, with floodwaters rising dozens of feet a year across the forest floor. Microbes in those drenched soils make methane, which is 28 to 86 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2. Trees act like smokestacks, channeling that methane to the atmosphere.  Meanwhile, moisture from the Atlantic Ocean that falls as rain gets sucked up by plants, used for photosynthesis, and exhaled by leaves through the same pores that take up CO2. Back in the atmosphere, it falls as rain again.  Humans complicate these natural cycles not just through climate change but through logging, reservoir-building, mining, and agriculture. Deforestation in Brazil has exploded in recent years, hitting a 12-year high in 2020, increasing nearly 10 percent from the year before.  Some of these processes draw down greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, while others cause the gases to rise, and they all influence one another. But until recently, no had attempted to understand that balance. “It’s this system of interacting parts, and they’re all measured in different ways, on different time scales, by different people,” Soper says.  What’s clear is that the forest has been changing fast and in alarming ways. Rain now falls in massive bursts more frequently than it once did, triggering record floods. Droughts come more often and, in some areas, last longer. Trees that fare better in wet places are being outcompeted by tall, drought-tolerant species. Illegally set fires are on the rise again. About 5.4 million acres burned in 2019, an area roughly the size of New Jersey.  So, in 2019, the National Geographic Society brought Covey, Soper, and a team of other Amazon experts together to begin trying to dissect how all of these pieces fit together. They didn’t take new measurements—they looked for new ways to analyze existing data with an eye toward a comprehensive picture.  Looking beyond CO2  While the results include some uncertainty, they make clear that focusing on a single metric—CO2—simply doesn’t paint an accurate picture. “As important as carbon is in the Amazon, it’s not the only thing that’s going on,” says Tom Lovejoy, a senior fellow in biodiversity with the United Nations Foundation, who has worked in the Brazilian Amazon for decades. “The only surprise, if you can call it that, is how much more there is when you add it all up.”  Resource extraction, damming rivers, and the conversion of forest for soybean and livestock production all alter the natural systems in a variety of ways. But most serve to warm the climate. Methane is a particularly important player. While the largest sources of methane are still from natural forest processes, the Amazon’s capacity to take up carbon used to do far more to offset its methane emissions. Humans have diminished that capacity.  Rob Jackson, an earth systems scientist at Stanford University and a leading expert on global greenhouse emissions, considers the new research a worthwhile contribution. “The Amazon is vulnerable, and we tend to get tunnel vision about one greenhouse gas alone,” he says.  Patrick Megonigal, associate director of research at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, agreed. “What the authors do that’s important is to expand the conversation beyond carbon dioxide, which is what 90 percent of public conversation is centered around,” he says.  “CO2 is not a lone actor. When you consider the whole cast of other characters, the outlook in the Amazon is that the impacts of human activities will be worse than we realize.”  Many questions remain. The biggest for Megonigal is one that Lovejoy also worries about: How do all of these factors influence the local Amazon climate? That’s important because the Amazon supplies much of its own moisture, with a single water molecule cycling through the forest five or more times as moist air moves from the Atlantic west over the continent.  A recent analysis by Lovejoy and Carlos Nobre, a climate scientist with the University of São Paulo's Institute for Advanced Studies, suggests that rising deforestation might so alter the flow of that moisture that it could push large stretches of the Amazon toward a permanent transition to a drier woodland savanna. The duo believes that tipping point could be reached if as little as 20 to 25 percent of the rainforest is cleared.  That would spell big trouble for the climate, substantially reducing even more the forests’ potential to scrub the skies of some of our fossil-fuel emissions. By the Brazilian government’s own measure, forest clearing already tops 17 percent.  What happens in Brazil (and neighboring countries in the Amazon) affects the whole world. In the United States, a group of environmental leaders from four previous presidential administrations, both Democratic and Republican—Bush senior, Clinton, Bush junior, and Obama—recently called on President Joe Biden to demand that Brazil’s government reduce deforestation. They urged Biden to use trade with the U.S. as leverage.  Brazil and the U.S. are currently in negotiations.

23,23,true/false,"Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has worst coral die-off ever Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has worst coral die-off ever  One of the world’s treasures, the Great Barrier Reef, just suffered from its worst coral die-off ever recorded, Australian scientists announced Monday.  Record coral kill-off on Great Barrier Reef Scientists confirm a mass bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef this year has killed more corals than ever before, with more than two thirds destroyed across large swathes of the biodiverse site. Video provided by AFP Newslook  Stress from unusually warm ocean water heated by man-made climate change and the natural El Niño climate pattern caused the die-off. ""The coral was cooked,” Terry Hughes, director of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, told the BBC.  At more than 1,400 miles long, Australia's Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef and the planet's biggest structure made by living organisms. In the northernmost section of the reef, which had been considered the most ""pristine,"" some 67% of the coral died.  The good news, scientists said, was that central and southern sections of the reef fared far better, with ""only"" 6% and 1% of the coral dead, respectively.  Coral reefs result from the work of little polyps, creatures only a few millimeters long, budded on top of one another. Over centuries, the shells of these creatures combine to form the exotic shapes of coral reefs. Tiny differences in the anatomy of each polyp species affect the shape of their shells and produce the exotic shapes of each reef.  The vibrant colors that draw thousands of tourists to the Great Barrier Reef each year come from algae that live in the corals tissue. When water temperatures become too high, coral becomes stressed and expels the algae, which leave the coral a bleached white color.  Mass coral bleaching is a new phenomenon and was never observed before the 1980s as global warming ramped up.  Besides their beauty, reefs shelter land from storms, and are also a habitat for myriads of species.  ""Coral reefs are therefore the most biologically diverse ecosystems of the planet, and provide a number of ecosystem services that hundreds of millions of people rely on,"" said Greg Torda, also of the Centre, in an e-mail to USA TODAY.  ""These include provisioning (fishing, other types of harvesting, for pharmaceuticals, for example), coastal protection, aesthetic and cultural values – to name a few. If corals are lost, so are all the services they provide to humans; and so are all the species that directly or indirectly rely on them.""  Tourism on the Great Barrier Reef employs 70,000 people, and generates $5 billion (Australian) in income each year, the Centre said in a statement.  The good news is that much of the coral survived this bleaching event. But looking to the future, mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef will likely be an annual phenomenon within a decade, Torda said.  If all the coral died on the reef, “it would be among the largest mass extinction events in history,” said Torda."
24,24,true/false,"7th Lecture Series: Makinde hails Oduyoye, describes him as a unifier Engr. ‘Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, on Tuesday, described Hon. Babatunde Oduyoye, who is currently serving as his Special Adviser on Strategy and Political Matters, as a unifier.  The governor gave the commendation while speaking at the Annual Birthday Lecture Series in commemoration of the birthday of the former Minority Whip of the House of Representatives and a two-term member of the House, Hon. (Chief) Babatunde Oduyoye, at Oritsejolomi Hall, International Conference Centre, University of Ibadan.  The lecture, with the topic: ‘Security and National Unity in Difficult Times’ was delivered by the chairman of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum (NGF) and governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi.  He equally commended the celebrant for always demonstrating a commitment to any course he believes in to the point of success, adding that, as a governor, he has won many political battles with the intervention of Oduyoye.  “Well, we have all listened to the lecture, which was given by a Ph.D. holder in war studies. But I only have one or two things to say about today’s celebrant, Hon Babatunde Oduyoye. Governor Fayemi said he is a good man. Yes, He is.  “And one thing I can say about Hon Babatunde Oduyoye is, He is a unifier. In this gathering, I have seen members of the APC and PDP. I can also see members of the aggrieved PDP. Also, I can see some members of progressives (Afenifere). So, He is a unifier.  “In 2015, I contested to be the governor and lost. I was going around to see where I was not doing things right and then a very close brother of mine told me that I did not look for a unifier and that was why I lost the election. So, he took me to Hon. Oduyoye. And when I got to him, he said I failed because all other governorship candidates came to meet him and I did not come. And I said, going forward, we will work together. And from that point forward, he demonstrated commitment.  “And I can tell you that he flew outside the country on my behalf to go have a former governor to accept me into the fold and, at the end, of the day, God took control.  “If Hon. Oduyoye makes any commitment, you can rest assured that he will follow through. So, I did not have any problem after I was sworn in as the governor and I had to appoint him as my Special Adviser and Politics and Strategy. He has been doing some talking behind the scene.  “Today, I am happy to be here for this lecture series. I pray that many more will come. And I am using you as a point of contact for Nigeria and all the October 1st celebrants. I wish all of you many more years of fruitful service to our state, our country in good health.”  The Babatunde Oduyoye Annual Birthday Lecture Series is a platform for discussion of critical national issues and proffering solutions to contemporary national existential challenges.  Some of the previous lectures were delivered by notable personalities including the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Ghali Umar Na’Abba, the late elder statesman, Alhaji Balarabe Musa, highly-rated academics and political heavyweights.  Other dignitaries at the event included the Oyo State governor, ‘Seyi Makinde; former Governor Rashidi Ladoja and his wife, Alhaja Mutiat Ladoja; Speaker, Oyo State House of Assembly, Honourable Adebo Ogundoyin; Majority Leader; Oyo House of Assembly, Honourable Sanjo Adedoyin former Chief of Staff to Oyo State governor, Chief Bisi Ilaka, among others."
25,25,true/false,"26,000 National Guard troops came to DC and protected the inauguration without incident. Now the drawdown begins National Guard troops in Washington D.C. in the wake of a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol building on January 6 talk about the experience of being mobilized.  After every military troop surge eventually comes the drawdown, and that’s what is starting to take place in Washington.  National Guard officials say that after about 26,000 troops poured into the city to help protect Wednesday’s inauguration events, they are working to pull troops out and bring them home.  There were no security incidents reported involving the National Guard, officials said in a media release.  “The National Guard is now focusing on coordinating with federal law enforcement to meet any continuing requirements while simultaneously working the logistics to return Guard members to their home states, families, and employers,” the release stated. “As the mission wraps up in the capital region, the National Guard Bureau is working to assist states with preparations and logistics to return troops safely home. ""  Though the inauguration ended safely, “we will continue to support federal law enforcement as requested,” said Army Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard. “Our Guard members will return home as soon as conditions permit.”  On Jan. 6, then-acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller approved up to 6,200 National Guard troops to support civil authorities in the District of Columbia for up to 31 days under Title 32, 502(f) authority  About 10,600 troops remain on duty right now, Air Force Maj. Matthew Murphy, an NGB spokesman, told Military Times. The other 15,000 troops are in the process of heading back home now, he said.  “The planning and process may take several days, but arrangements are being made to return close to 15,000 troops as soon as possible and should conclude within a five to 10-day period,” Murphy said. “Demobilization is involved with equipment turn-in and accountability, travel arrangements, COVID screening and mitigation. Troops will leave by ground transportation, airlift provided by the Air National Guard and contracted commercial air as necessary.”  But about 7,000 troops will remain through the end of the month, he said.  “Some agencies are requesting continuity of operations, additional support and recuperation time for their forces to regroup. Approximately 7,000 National Guard personnel are anticipated to provide that assistance through the end of the month,” said Murphy.  RELATED  D.C. National Guard troops will remain on-post until at least Jan. 30, Mayor Muriel Bowser said during a Thursday afternoon press conference. Future deployment of the DCNG depends on future threats, she said.  “We are evaluating … what we think would be intelligence from federal partners that suggest the need” for continued or future DCNG presence in the city,” she said.  Bowser said she asked Christopher Rodriguez, director of the city’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency, to “begin working with our partners to deal with the threat of white extremism and any other threat to our city.”  Rodriguez said that “the threat of right-wing extremism is here. You saw it on Jan. 6. It continues to be a persistent and real threat to the District of Columbia and the region.”  RELATED  Before the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol siege by supporters of then-President Donald Trump, Bowser said there was no reason to consider calling in the Guard to help protect the Capitol during joint sessions of Congress, like the election certification process that was taking place when the building was stormed.  But in the wake of that event, which took the lives of five people, including Air Force veteran and Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, Bowser said security changes need to be made.  “It is very clear any joint session of Congress should be a special security event or some package like that,” she said.  The next such event is likely to be President Joe Biden’s address to Congress, which will probably take place some time in February.  Hokanson, the NGB chief, said the public has been grateful for the help.  “The outpouring of support to our National Guard across the entire country, and here in the District of Columbia, is a story in itself. I want to particularly thank the citizens of the District of Columbia,” said Hokanson.

26,26,true/false,"COVID vaccine immunity is waning — how much does that matter? As debates about booster shots heat up, what’s known about the duration of vaccine-based immunity is still evolving.  For those vaccinated against COVID-19, antibody levels eventually wane, but this is not the whole story.Credit: Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library  Six months ago, Miles Davenport and his colleagues made a bold prediction. On the basis of published results from vaccine trials and other data sources, they estimated that people immunized against COVID-19 would lose approximately half of their defensive antibodies every 108 days or so. As a result, vaccines that initially offered, say, 90% protection against mild cases of disease might only be 70% effective after 6 or 7 months1.  “It felt a little bit out on a limb at the time,” says Davenport, a computational immunologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. But on the whole, his group’s predictions have come true.  Immunological studies have documented a steady decline of antibody levels among vaccinated individuals2. Long-term follow-up of vaccine trial participants has revealed a growing risk of breakthrough infection3. And health-care records from countries such as Israel, the United Kingdom and elsewhere all show that COVID-19 vaccines are losing their strength, at least when it comes to keeping a lid on transmissible disease.  That’s without accounting for the Delta threat either — and it’s clear that vaccine–induced antibodies do a worse job at recognizing SARS-CoV-2 variants compared with the ancestral strain of the virus4. What remains unclear, however, is to what degree the immune system’s safeguards that protect vaccinated people against severe disease, hospitalization and death might be fading as well. “That,” says Davenport, “is the million-dollar question at the moment.”  As discussions over booster programmes heat up — with leading global-health authorities coming out publicly against the idea this week, UK officials endorsing boosters for the over-50s, and advisers to US regulators meeting on 17 September to discuss the issue — Nature takes stock of the data informing the debate.  How is vaccine-induced immunity holding up?  “Things wane,” says Nicole Doria-Rose, an immunologist at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland. But not all things wane equally.  ‘Neutralizing’ antibodies that can intercept viruses before they infiltrate cells might not have much staying power. Levels of these molecules typically shoot up after vaccination, then quickly taper off months later. “That’s how vaccines work,” Doria-Rose says.  But cellular immune responses are longer lasting — and as Jennifer Gommerman, an immunologist at the University of Toronto in Canada, explains: “Cellular immunity is what’s going to protect you from disease.” Memory B cells, which can rapidly deploy more antibodies in the event of re-exposure to the virus, tend to stick around, and so do T cells, which can attack already-infected cells. Both provide an added measure of protection should SARS-CoV-2 sneak past the body’s first line of defence.  In one of the only long-term studies to consider these three planks of the immune system simultaneously — antibodies, B cells and T cells — researchers found that vaccination spurred durable cellular immunity5. Memory B cells continued to grow in numbers for at least six months, and got better at fighting the virus over time. T-cell counts remained relatively stable, dipping only slightly over the duration of the study period.  “So, you have this reserve,” says John Wherry, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia, who led the study. “Circulating antibodies may be declining, but your immune system is capable of jumping into action once again.”  How can immune memory actually be getting stronger?  Research from immunologist Ali Ellebedy, at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, Missouri, helps to explain the vigour of the memory-B-cell response. His group took samples from the lymph nodes of vaccinated individuals and found tiny B-cell finishing schools — called germinal centres — that were churning out ever more potent immune cells as time went on6.  B cells in these structures randomly mutate their genes to create entire new sets of antibodies. Those cells that produce the best antibody repertoires eventually win out through an evolutionary process that augments the immune system’s ability to fight off Delta and other SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.  Ellebedy and his colleagues initially described the persistence of these germinal centres for 15 weeks post-immunization with an RNA-based jab — longer than anyone had ever seen before with older-technology vaccines for other ailments. Now, the researchers have unpublished data, following the germinal centres for up to six months. “The training camp is still going,” Ellebedy says. “It’s amazing.”  Should that immune memory give durable protection against severe disease?  For the most part, it should. But, says Theodora Hatziioannou, a virologist at the Rockefeller University in New York City, “if protection from disease relies at any level on circulating neutralizing antibodies” — and those molecules are clearly on the decline — “then, yes, the longer out you are from natural infection or from vaccination the worse you will be”.  Real-world data from diagnostic-testing records and hospital databases suggest that this might be the case. In Israel, for example, elderly people who got their shots at the beginning of the year seemed to have almost double the risk of severe illness during a July outbreak compared with similar individuals who were immunized more recently7. As researchers reported this week, older individuals given a third dose of vaccine were less likely to become infected and much less likely to develop severe disease than those who had not received the boosters8.  Third-dose COVID-19 vaccine programmes have already begun in Israel, and data about their effectiveness are starting to come in.Credit: Kobi Wolf/Bloomberg via Getty  To Eran Segal, a computational biologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, who advises the Israeli government on COVID-19 issues, the implications are clear-cut. “There’s compelling evidence that the third dose increases protection dramatically.”  But as University of Pennsylvania biostatistician Jeffrey Morris points out, inferences made from observational studies of this kind should be viewed with a critical eye. People going about their everyday lives are not clinical-trial participants. They are not randomized to account for behavioural and demographic differences. And although statistical modelling can help to correct for some of these variables, it’s impossible to account for all potential confounding factors.  “The bottom line,” Morris says, “is we need careful modelling and we need really thorough data to deconvolve all these things.”  What about other countries besides Israel?  Preliminary data from the United Kingdom and Qatar would seem to confirm the Israeli experience. Researchers at Public Health England posted a preprint this week detailing a modest but appreciable dip in vaccine effectiveness against hospital admission and death. This occurred about 20 weeks out from inoculation for recipients both of the mRNA vaccine from Pfizer–BioNTech and the viral vector vaccine from the AstraZeneca — although the effect was most pronounced for older individuals and those with underlying health conditions. Among the elderly, there was also some indication that spacing out the initial two doses of vaccine promoted more durable protective immunity.  Meanwhile, in Qatar, Laith Abu-Raddad and his colleagues described last month how the vaccine from Pfizer–BioNTech had provided consistently high protection against critical illness for up to six months post-immunization. Vaccine effectiveness against mild or symptom-free infections has declined gradually, as expected. But at the time that he posted a preprint online, on 27 August9, Abu-Raddad, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar in Doha, was unsure about the need for booster shots.  Then, he says, he saw the data from seven months post-immunization. Although the results are preliminary, the vaccine’s ability to ward off hospitalization and death seems to drop off. “The data now forced a change in thinking,” says Abu-Raddad. (A comparable study from the United States has so far reported data only on waning protection against infection, not severe disease10.)  Still, globally, there is as yet no indication that the rates of severe illness among the vaccinated are spiking in any appreciable way. “The vaccines are really designed to prevent disease,” says Julie McElrath, an infectious-disease specialist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington. “That is still holding up.”  Even if most vaccinated individuals are not getting really sick, are there other benefits to boosters?  Reducing rates of infection should help break the cycle of viral transmission, which would ultimately result in fewer cases of severe COVID-19 and death. And according to Fyodor Kondrashov, an evolutionary geneticist at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria in Klosterneuburg, it should also help keep the emergence of vaccine-resistant variants at bay.  “Things that are good from the epidemiological perspective,“ he says, “are also good from the evolutionary perspective.”  As Kondrashov’s modelling work has shown, resistant viruses are most likely to emerge when transmission is not controlled11. Getting more people vaccinated is the single most effective intervention to keep transmission rates low, but any bump in vaccine effectiveness can help as well.  So far, no human vaccine has been completely undermined by resistance in the way that many anti-infective drugs have, says Andrew Read, who studies the evolution of infectious diseases at Pennsylvania State University in University Park. “It’s eroded their benefits,” he says, but in ways that have been fixable with tweaks in vaccine design.  That’s not to say it won’t happen with COVID-19 vaccines. “We’re on new territory here,” says Read. The Delta variant took the world by surprise. Evolution — and our immunological responses — could have more surprises in store.  But any discussion around the need for boosters cannot be had in a vacuum. In addition to considerations of immune kinetics among the immunized, there are also issues of vaccine equity and availability to factor in. And as long as vaccinated people are staying out of hospitals and morgues, then to Katrina Lythgoe, an evolutionary epidemiologist at the University of Oxford, UK, theoretical arguments around vaccine resistance are secondary. “In my view,” she says, “apart from people who are particularly vulnerable, efforts should be directed to getting people, globally, vaccinated.”"
27,27,true/false,"Indoor and outdoor air pollution 'claiming at least 40,000 UK lives a year' WOODSIDE — She was a high school dropout at 15. Then a grocery clerk, then a Harvard MBA, then a rock star high tech executive. At 37, having revolutionized the dot-com world by helping to create Amazon, she quit to lead another, more personal startup: her own life. Joy Covey often went rock climbing and kite-boarding, and undertook her greatest adventure with the birth of son Tyler eight years ago. She was 50 when she died Wednesday. Riding her bike down one of Skyline Boulevard’s treacherous hills, she collided with a van. Like so much else in Covey’s life, her death came suddenly, a shock to friends and admirers who never knew what to expect from her next. Before becoming an Internet pioneer, Covey was the restless daughter of a doctor and nurse, who were no doubt taken aback when she abruptly quit as a freshman at San Mateo High School, but not appalled. With a blazing IQ of 173 and an adventurer’s urge to try something new, instead of surrendering to boredom, she left home at 15. “I thought, ‘If I don’t obey, what can they do?’ ” Covey said in a 1999 interview with Fortune magazine, which had just named her to its list of Most Powerful Women in Business. “I decided, there’s no more following the rules.” Name some poets She passed the high school equivalency exam, then bagged groceries in Fresno for a while, graduated from Cal State-Fresno in 21/2 years, and scored second highest in the country on the exam to become a certified public accountant. A brief stint at the accounting firm Arthur Young led her to Harvard, where she earned an MBA and a law degree. She was the only member of her Harvard cohort to arrive with bragging rights over bagging both groceries and high school. “I was completely intimidated by the rest of the class,” Covey told the Harvard Law Bulletin in a 2002 interview. “Not having finished high school and having been fairly utilitarian in the way I went about college, I didn’t have a deep liberal arts background. So we’d go to lunch and people would talk about their favorite seventeenth-century poets, and I’d be thinking, ‘Could I even name five poets? From any century?’ It wasn’t until we got our first-semester grades back that I started to realize that everything was going to be OK.” Metamorphosis Amazon co-founder and CEO Jeff Bezos named the company after the Amazon River, which in turn was named after Greek mythology’s legendary nation of female warriors. That was Covey’s tribe after taking the position of chief financial officer at the fledgling online bookseller at age 33. When she joined Amazon, the company had 150 employees and annual losses that would soon grow into the hundreds of millions. She led Amazon’s IPO, counseling impatient Wall Street analysts to expect more red ink before profitability. By the time she quit to go skiing in 2000, Covey’s net worth was estimated at $200 million. Amazon now has 97,000 employees and a market capitalization of $142.6 billion, all of it based on a structure she put in place. She always insisted that she hadn’t retired, just gone through another metamorphosis. This one led her to pour energy and considerable money into the National Resources Defense Council, where she served on the board and as treasurer. In the cycling accident that killed her, the driver of the van, a 22-year-old Fremont man, had turned left in front of her from the oncoming lane at the last instant, according to CHP spokesman Arturo Montiel. He stayed at the scene and has not been cited in the incident. Montiel said the collision is still under investigation. Staff writer Joshua Melvin contributed to this report.

28,28,true/false,"The ozone layer is healing, new study finds The father of the Honduran girl who became the face of the family separation crisis has revealed that he still has not been in touch with his wife or daughter but was happy to learn they are safe. Denis Javier Varela Hernandez, 32, said that he had not heard from his wife Sandra, 32, who was with his two-year-old daughter Yanela Denise, for nearly three weeks until he saw the image of them being apprehended in Texas. In an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com, Hernandez, who lives in Puerto Cortes, Honduras, says that he was told on Wednesday by a Honduran official in the US that his wife and child are being detained at a family residential center in Texas but are together and are doing 'fine.' 'You can imagine how I felt when I saw that photo of my daughter. It broke my heart. It's difficult as a father to see that, but I know now that they are not in danger. They are safer now than when they were making that journey to the border,' he said. Denis said his wife and daughter were never separated by border control agents and remain together. Denis Javier Varela Hernandez (far right) spoke out about his wife Sandra and daughter, Yanela Two-year-old Yanela, a Honduran asylum seeker, has become the face of the child separation crisis after she was photographed crying in McAllen, Texas, as Border Control agents searched her mother A spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has told DailyMail.com that Sandra had been previously been deported from the US in 2013. The spokeswoman said that she was 'encountered by immigration officials in Hebbronville, Texas' in and sent back to Honduras 15 days later under 'expedited removal.' Sandra current immigration proceedings are 'ongoing' and she is being housed at a family detention center in Texas. Denis said that his wife had previously mentioned her wish to go to the United States for a 'better future' but did not tell him nor any of their family members that she was planning to make the trek. 'I didn't support it. I asked her, why? Why would she want to put our little girl through that? But it was her decision at the end of the day.' He said that Sandra had always wanted to experience 'the American dream' and hoped to find a good job in the States. Denis, who works as a captain at a port on the coast of Puerto Cortes, explained that things back home were fine but not great, and that his wife was seeking political asylum. He said that Sandra set out on the 1,800-mile journey with the baby girl on June 3, at 6am, and he has not heard from her since. 'I never got the chance to say goodbye to my daughter and now all I can do is wait', he said, adding that he hopes they are either granted political asylum or are sent back home. Yanela's father, Denis Javier Varela Hernandez (left), said that he had not heard from his daughter Yanela, one year and 11 months, and his wife for a month until he saw the image of them being apprehended Denis says that he has not spoken to his wife or daughter since they left for their journey from Puerto Cortes, Honduras, to the US on June 3 Above Sandra and little Yanela are seen being detained by US Border Patrol agents 'I don't have any resentment for my wife, but I do think it was irresponsible of her to take the baby with her in her arms because we don't know what could happen.' The couple has three other children, son Wesly, 14, and daughters Cindy, 11, and Brianna, six. 'The kids see what's happening. They're a little worried but I don't try to bring it up that much. They know their mother and sister are safe now.' Denis said that he believes the journey across the border is only worth it to some degree, and admits that it's not something he would ever consider. He said he heard from friends that his wife paid $6,000 for a coyote - a term for someone who smuggles people across the border. 'I wouldn't risk my life for it. It's hard to find a good job here and that's why many people choose to leave. But I thank God that I have a good job here. And I would never risk my life making that journey.' The heart-breaking photo was taken by Getty photographer John Moore close to midnight on the night of June 12 near McAllen, Texas, as the row over Donald Trump's separation of migrant parents and children escalated. Denis said that he hopes to use the photo and his family's situation to help him reunite with his daughter. 'I don't want money, what I want is someone to tell me that my daughter is going to be OK.' When asked about his views on Trump's border policy, Denis said: 'I've never seen it in a positive light the way others do. It violates human rights and children's rights. Separating children from their parents is just wrong. They are suffering and are traumatized. 'The laws need to be modified and we need to have a conversation. It's just not right. '[Illegal] Immigration and drug smuggling across the United States border is never gonna stop. They can build a wall and it's never going to stop,' he said. Sandra was part of a group that were caught by Border Patrol agents after making their way across the Rio Grande river on a raft. Hernandez's wife was part of a group that were caught by Border Patrol agents after making their way across the Rio Grande river on a raft. Hernandez said that he had heard through family members that his wife and daughter had not actually been separated Hernandez's daughters, Cindy, Yanela, and Brianna Moore's photo showed Yanela crying on a dirt track as her mother is patted down by a Border Patrol agent. For many the photo summed up the cruelty of Trump's 'zero tolerance' policy towards migrants which has caused 2,300 children to be separated from their mothers and fathers. A photo of Yanela was used on the front cover of TIME magazine to show the devastating effect of the policy, which was brought in in April. TIME magazine's July 2 cover features Yanela crying and looking up at President Donald Trump. The cover reads: 'Welcome to America' But actually Yanela remained with her mother after she arrived in the US after making the perilous 1,800 mile journey North through Central America and Mexico, TIME magazine later issued a clarification saying that the original version of its story accompanying the cover was wrong because Yanela ‘was not carried away screaming by Border Patrol Agents’. TIME’s editor in chief Edward Felsenthal said in a statement that it stood behind the wider point which is that Yanela was ‘the most visible symbol of the ongoing immigration debate’ Among those who have Tweeted DailyMail.com’s story have been White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. She wrote: ‘It’s shameful that dems and the media exploited this photo of a little girl to push their agenda. She was not separated from her mom. The separation here is from the facts’. Moore, who has worked on the border with Mexico for years and has won a Pulitzer for his photography, has said the the image of Yanela was the last one he took that night. Speaking to People magazine he said that the girl's mother was the last to be searched and a female agent asked her to put Yanela down so she could pat her down. Hernandez said that he wanted his wife and daughter to come home and that he would welcome them when they return Hernandez said that Yanela (center in her mother's arms) is the youngest of four children and she was the only one that traveled with her mother, a decision that surprised him Moore said: 'The mother hesitated and then set down the little girl and the child immediately started crying. ‘As a father, it was very emotional for me just to hear those cries. When I saw this little girl break down in tears I wanted to comfort this child. 'But as a photojournalist we sometimes have to keep photographing when things are hard. And tell a story that people would never see.' Moore crouched 6ft from the girl as she looked up at her mother and took seven shots, Yanela's mother's hands spread out on the Border Patrol truck. The image was a major factor in pressuring Trump to do a U-turn on his immigration policy and sign an executive order allowing families to stay together. The President said that he wanted to look strong but admitted that the 'zero tolerance' policy made him look like he had 'no heart'. Trump's climb down came after worldwide outrage including British Prime Minister Theresa May who called his policy 'deeply disturbing' while Pope Francis said it was 'immoral'. The climb down was a rare one from Trump, who almost never apologizes and rarely backs down.

29,29,true/false,"Most people don't know climate change is entirely human-made AdvertisementsOne day after the February 3 2020 Iowa caucuses — the first primary voting of all fifty American states — the hashtag #IowaCaucusDisaster remained at the top of Twitter’s “trending” charts after a confusing night with no clear, announced results. Even before caucus-goers gathered in Iowa to participate, the lead-up to the event was, to say the least, unusual. One of the first unexpected occurrences involved a decision to withhold the results of a highly anticipated final poll because of an apparent irregularity involving presidential contender Pete Buttigieg: The Des Moines Register poll, a closely watched indicator of the Iowa race, was canceled after at least one interviewer apparently omitted Pete Buttigieg’s name from the randomized list of candidates the surveyor read. The political website Axios reported that the reason for the error was that an interviewer increased the font size of the questionnaire on a computer screen, leaving the bottom choice invisible. A prescient article published by The Atlantic on February 3 2020, prior to the start of the caucuses, predicted possible chaos: BURLINGTON, Iowa—A crush of new Democratic voters, mobilized by a wave of anti-Trump energy, will arrive at their caucus precinct, and there will not be enough voter-registration forms. The lines will be long, and some Iowans, many of them elderly, will shiver in the cold for hours before getting inside. The caucus itself will be pandemonium: There won’t be enough preference cards for caucus-goers to write down their favorite presidential contenders. Voters will be incensed when they learn about the new realignment rules. There will be miscounts and recounts. And at the end of the night, once all the numbers have been crunched and recrunched, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders will each claim victory. This is Sandy Dockendorff’s nightmare scenario for tonight’s caucus. The 62-year-old former nurse, who is running a caucus in the small town of Danville, laid it all out for me over coffee [in late January 2020]. Her worst fears are unlikely to be realized. “The party has done everything it can to make sure that’s not the case,” she said. But the caucus is extremely complex, and rule changes threaten to make it even more bewildering for voters to navigate and complicated for the press to cover. The biggest fear: Democrats may not have a clear winner—a scenario that could further threaten Iowa’s imperiled first-in-the-nation position. Alas, it seemed Dockendorff’s fears were more than realized as the night wore on. As results failed to appear, social media lit up with debate over what exactly was taking place in Iowa, leading to, among other things, memes satirizing the lack of reported results: Just after 10PM Eastern time, the Iowa State Democratic Party stated it was doing “quality control” testing, thus delaying the results of the caucuses: In a void where results had been anticipated, speculation and rumors predictably rushed in to take their place. A number of claims were popular on Twitter, many of which in whole or in part attempted to explain the mitigating factors in the Iowa caucus meltdown. Rumor #1: Robby Mook, former campaign manager during Hillary Clinton’s unsuccessful 2016 presidential bid, designed an app used to limited efficacy during the Iowa caucuses. Mook’s name emerged Monday night as the purported architect of an app being blamed for many of the problems with Iowa caucus reporting; the app developer was provided as Shadow, and a related company identified as ACRONYM: Mook denied designing the app: On January 29 2020, the Des Moines Register reported Mook and another former campaign manager had consulted with the app’s developers, not that either had a hand in developing it: Both parties in Iowa and their app and web development vendors partnered [in fall 2018] with Harvard’s Defending Digital Democracy Project to develop strategies and systems to protect results and deal with any misinformation that’s reported on caucus night. They worked with campaign experts Robby Mook and Matt Rhodes — as well as experts in cybersecurity, national security, technology and election administration — and simulated the different ways that things could go wrong on caucus night. Mook, 2016 campaign manager for Hillary Clinton, and Rhodes, Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign manager, helped develop a public-service video to alert campaigns to the warning signs of hacking and misinformation. It was released in 2018, days after a federal indictment detailed how Russian intelligence operatives hacked Clinton’s presidential campaign, the DNC and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2016. Mook’s name did not appear in a separate February 4 2020 Des Moines Register item about Clinton campaign operatives and the app in play in Iowa, and the organization also reported that Nevada would not be using the app in its own caucus: The smartphone application blamed in part for the ongoing delay in reporting results of the [February 3 2020] Iowa caucuses is linked with key Iowa and national Democrats associated with Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. The revelation came as the Nevada Democratic Party announced [February 4 2020] it would not be using the same app in its Feb. 22 [2020] caucuses, despite earlier reports to the contrary. The app was issued by Jimmy Hickey of Shadow Inc., metadata of the program that the Des Moines Register analyzed Tuesday shows. Gerard Niemira and Krista Davis, who worked for Clinton’s 2016 campaign, co-founded Shadow. Rumor #2: Iowa caucus results were delayed due to onerous reporting requirements instituted by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) on the request of Bernie Sanders supporters in 2016. Another rumor spreading held that supporters of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in 2016 were largely at fault for the Iowa caucuses debacle in 2020: Tweets making that claim sometimes came with screenshots of a February 3 2020 Associated Press piece about changes to the caucus system: Q: Why are Democrats making this change? A: The new rules were mandated by the DNC as part of a package of changes sought by Bernie Sanders following his loss to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential primaries. The changes were designed to make the caucus system more transparent and to make sure that even the lowest-performing candidates get credit for all the votes they receive. And it’s not just Iowa that is affected by the changes. The Nevada Democratic caucuses on Feb. 22 will also report three sets of results. Without context, it looked as if those two conditions — Iowa’s delayed caucus results and Sanders’ objections to 2016 caucusing — were directly related. But a December 2017 Des Moines Register report about the changes as they unfolded provided a bit more context before the 2020 primaries were underway. It began by reporting that absentee Iowans would be able to participate in 2020: Iowa’s first-in-the-nation Democratic presidential caucuses would break with decades of tradition in 2020 by allowing voters to cast absentee ballots and then releasing the raw total of votes won by each candidate. A Democratic National Committee panel known as the Unity Reform Commission set those changes into motion during a meeting here [in December 2017], clearing the way for perhaps the most significant changes to the Iowa caucuses since they emerged as a key step in the presidential nominating process five decades ago … DNC Chairman Tom Perez called the caucus reforms “game-changing.” “Obviously we want to make sure that if you’re a shift worker you can vote in a caucus,” Perez said. “We want to make sure a member of the military or someone else who’s been left out of the process — that you can vote, that you can make sure your franchise is exercised.” The piece quoted Sanders 2016 operative Jeff Weaver on complaints about the 2016 caucus: Commission member Jeff Weaver pointed to 2016 candidate Martin O’Malley, who campaigned heavily in Iowa and won a following but received 0.6 percent of the state delegate equivalents … The change forces Iowa, in effect, to release at least two different results: the traditional calculation of state delegate equivalents as well as a much more straightforward tally of votes. Finally, the reforms centered on the controversial influence of DNC “superdelegates,” party-appointed individuals unbound by primary results with outsized influence on the final tallies: In other business, the commission moved to scale back the influence of so-called “super-delegates” — the party leaders and insiders who were not bound to support a particular presidential candidate in previous national conventions. In a series of recommendations, the commission sharply reduced the number of super-delegates who can back a candidate regardless of how that candidate performed in their home state’s caucus or primary. The move is a response to 2016 convention delegates and particularly supporters of Bernie Sanders who believed Hillary Clinton’s nomination was unfairly bolstered by super-delegates who were unaccountable to the will of voters in their states. It is broadly true that supporters of Sanders (such as Weaver) as well as the DNC instituted reforms affecting the 2020 Iowa caucuses. But it was unclear whether those reforms — particularly ones involving superdelegates — had any direct effects on the Iowa caucus chaos. Rumor #3: “Quality control.” As mentioned above, Iowa’s official Democratic Party cited “quality control” as a cause for the delayed results, promising a 50 percent tally by 5PM on February 4 2020. It is true that the Democratic Party referenced “quality control,” but few details about what that meant exactly were available the morning after the Iowa caucuses: The party said it was doing “quality control” on the results before releasing them out of “an abundance of caution.” In a statement, the party said that 25% of precincts have reported results, but they have not publicly announced any numbers. The delay was linked, in part, to issues with a new app being used by the Iowa Democratic Party to report precinct results, though the party denied that the app crashed. The Iowa Democratic Party in a statement said, “We found inconsistencies in the reporting of three sets of results.” At 1:14 PM EST on February 4 2020, NPR reported: But as of Tuesday afternoon [February 4 2020], the state’s Democratic Party was still struggling to report the outcome of [the previous] night’s caucuses, blaming the delay on problems with that app. The party told campaign representatives it plans to release some results by 5 p.m. ET [on February 4 2020]. The party said it has determined “with certainty” that “the underlying data” via its new app “was sound.” In a statement Tuesday [February 4 2020], party chair Troy Price said the app was recording data accurately, but “it was reporting out only partial data” because of a “coding issue in the reporting system.” NPR’s reporting also pointed out that the app and its late introduction to caucus chairs might be in part to blame for the chaos and confusion: Multiple county chairs blamed the app for the delayed reporting of results. Holly Christine Brown said she was only appointed [in late January 2020] as the Asian/Pacific Islander caucus chair for the Iowa Democratic Party and first saw the app on [the evening of January 31 2020]. “We were just given access to the app and told, ‘Play around in there a little bit,’ and that was about as much training as we got,” Brown told NPR’s Rachel Martin. “We were able to call in and ask questions, but there was no real training on the app.” Brown said the problems with [February 3 2020] caucuses will “absolutely” increase calls to change Iowa’s system. “People are very upset about how this happened and how this played out,” she said. Elesha Gayman, the Scott County Democratic chair, said the app was difficult to use for older and younger people alike. “It was unique; it’s not something you can download in the app store,” she said. “You actually had to fill out a form. In addition to that, you got a series of PIN numbers. And so, yeah, there was a lot of layers and I think that absolutely mucked it up. Anecdotally, a few of the people I do know who used the app successfully were younger people. But I do know some young people that also had troubles, just so many layers.” … But the app didn’t work for Des Moines County Democratic Party Co-Chairman Tom Courtney. “Things didn’t work out right,” said Courtney, who said he tried to call in the results for several hours but couldn’t get through because the number was “constantly busy.” NPR also echoed reporting about Nevada Democratic Party officials swearing off use of the app for their February 22 2020 caucuses: “NV Dems can confidently say that what happened in the Iowa caucus last night will not happen in Nevada on February 22nd [2020],” the party said in a statement. “We will not be employing the same app or vendor used in the Iowa caucus. We had already developed a series of backups and redundant reporting systems, and are currently evaluating the best path forward.” Rumor #3: Unfair coin flips or coin tosses. A contentious element of the 2016 Iowa caucuses involved the purported use of coin flips to award delegates, a factor witnesses inevitably claimed was unfair. A number of Iowa coin flip rumors circulated on Twitter, but as was the case in 2016, their claims were impossible to either verify or debunk: Myriad rumors about the delay continued spreading on social media the day after the Iowa caucuses. Use of a new app called Shadow was blamed by many caucus chairs for the difficulties, and Iowa’s Democratic Party cited only an “abundance of caution” regarding “quality control” for the delays. Related rumors about coin flips or coin tosses used to award delegates also circulated widely on social media, but without firm results or numbers, it remained difficult to draw any conclusions about the array of speculative claims regarding chaos at Iowa’s caucuses in 2020."
30,30,true/false,"'Freedom day' in England as virus ramps up in Asia LONDON: England lifted most pandemic restrictions Monday despite surging infections and dire warnings from experts, as the Delta variant sweeps parts of Europe and Asia, where new cases are threatening to scupper the upcoming Tokyo Olympics.As England celebrated so-called “freedom day”, Vietnam locked down much of its population, while Indonesia clocked daily record deaths and in France lawmakers were set to toughen vaccine rules to battle rising cases.The highly transmissible Delta variant, first detected in India, is driving new outbreaks along with a relaxation of measures, as countries seek to kickstart virus-battered economies.In Britain, daily infections have climbed, averaging more than 50,000 since last week, with Delta taking hold in many areas.But despite accusations against the UK government of recklessness, it lifted legal mandates on social distancing, wearing masks and working from home, urging personal responsibility instead.Nightclubs in England reopened their floors to dancers at the stroke of midnight for the first time since March 2020, while sports stadiums, cinemas and theatres can now run at full capacity.“I thought, well, we missed New Year's, so why not come out and celebrate?” said Nicola Webster Calliste, 29, outside a club in Leeds, northern England.“It's like a new chapter.”Alex Clarke, 40, was at the front of the queue outside a club in north London.“There's a bit of apprehension and uncertainty about the protocols,” Clarke said. “But as long as everyone is sensible, then it'll be alright.”Covid-19 travel rules and self-isolation for close contacts remain in place.Prime Minister Boris Johnson , who is self-isolating after his health was affected, defended the move, dubbed “freedom day” by some media, but urged people to remain prudent.The government says thanks to a rapid vaccination programme, the risks to the healthcare system are manageable.But the approach is marked by “moral emptiness and epidemiological stupidity”, said University of Bristol public health expert Gabriel Scally.Elsewhere in Europe, countries including Greece, the Netherlands and Spain, have been forced to reimpose restrictions to battle new outbreaks recently.And in France, cabinet members were expected on Monday to approve stricter vaccination rules requiring people to show either proof of full vaccination or a recent test to enter public venues such as restaurants, bars, shopping centers, long-distance trains and cinemas.The coronavirus is known to have claimed more than four million lives since it emerged in late 2019 but, for some nations in the Asia-Pacific , the worst is still ahead.Indonesia has in recent days overtaken India and Brazil as the global covid-19 hotspot, its daily death toll hitting a record 1,338 on Monday.There are fears people travelling for the Eid al-Adha festivities could spread the virus further, and authorities in the vast Muslim-majority country strengthened roadblocks on Monday for the start of the holidays.Vietnam ordered about a third of its 100 million people to stay at home in several provinces as it battles new outbreaks, with a record 6,000 new daily infections reported.Although Australia has enjoyed far lower case numbers than most nations, it is also struggling with outbreaks in its two biggest cities, Melbourne and Australia.Melbourne extended a lockdown, meaning roughly 12 million Australians will remain under some form of stay-at-home order.In Myanmar, where hospitals are empty because of a long-running strike against the military junta, volunteers are going house-to-house to collect bodies for burials.“We are running our service without resting,” Than Than Soe told AFP at the bustling office of her volunteer group.And as organisers finalised preparations for the 2020 Olympics, set to open Friday with no spectators and with Tokyo under a state of emergency after a surge in cases, four virus cases were confirmed in the athletes' village.And on Monday a female American gymnast tested positive at an Olympic training camp, while another team member is self-isolating.The cases put a damper on the upcoming games, which have failed to secure much public support in Japan.The latest Asahi Shimbun newspaper poll found a majority of respondents, 55 percent, were against holding the Games this summer, with 33 percent in favour.In a sign of the current sentiment, auto giant Toyota said it would not run Olympics-related TV ads, and its executives will not be present at the opening ceremony.“Toyota officials will not attend the opening ceremony, and the chief reason behind it is there will be no spectators,” Toyota spokeswoman Shiori Hashimoto told AFP."
31,31,true/false,"AMCON seizes Senator Buhari’s properties The Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria says it has taken over assets belonging to Oyo North lawmaker, Senator Abdulfatai Buhari, over a N600m debt taken by his company, Abadat Ventures Limited.  AMCON said in a statement by its Spokesman, Mr. Jude Nwauzor, that Senator Buhari took the loan from Guaranty Trust Bank and refused to offset it despite repeated reminders.  According to the corporation, the decision to seize Senator Buhari’s assets was sequel to the order of Justice I. E Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja.  Some of the assets seized by AMCON include: a property at 12, St, Petersburg Street, Wuse II, Abuja and Plot 516 off Misau Crescent, off Birnin Kebbi Crescent, Garki II, Abuja.  The statement read in part, “Sequel to the order of Honourable Justice I. E Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, AMCON has taken over assets belonging to Alhaji Buhari Abdulfatai, Chief Promoter of Abadat Ventures Limited over indebtedness of almost N600m.  “Interestingly, Alhaji Buhari Abdulfatai is a serving Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria representing Ogbomosho North Federal Constituency in Oyo State a seat he won on the platform of the ruling All Progressive Congress.  “Justice Ekwo made the ruling on March 25, 2021, and in compliance to the enforcement order, AMCON went about putting the logistics together and on Friday, June 18, 2021, the corporation took effective possession of the two properties as listed by the court through its appointed Receiver Manager – Mr Baba Waziri of Baba Waziri & Co. Chambers.”  Apart from granting AMCON possession of the properties, the court also ordered the receiver manager to take all necessary steps required to realise the assets of the obligor, with a view to paying the outstanding loan in line with Section 553 and 554 of the Companies and Allied Matters Act, 2020.  The corporation said the non-performing loan of Abadat Ventures Limited was purchased by AMCON from Guaranty Trust Bank during the second phase of Eligible Bank Asset purchases in 2021.  “Since then, the obligor has been unwilling to repay the loan despite the concessions made available to him by the corporation in a bid to amicably resolve the bad debt,” AMCON said.

32,32,true/false,"Getting on with the job this week — Scottish National Party He did none of those things. I’ve reviewed all of his public statements and actions on coronavirus over the last two months, and they show a president who put almost no priority on public health. Trump’s priorities were different: Making the virus sound like a minor nuisance. Exaggerating his administration’s response. Blaming foreigners and, anachronistically, the Obama administration. Claiming incorrectly that the situation was improving. Trying to cheer up stock market investors. (It was fitting that his first public comments were from Davos and on CNBC.) Now that the severity of the virus is undeniable, Trump is already trying to present an alternate history of the last two months. Below are the facts — a timeline of what the president was saying, alongside statements from public-health experts as well as data on the virus. Late January On the same day that Trump was dismissing the risks on CNBC, Tom Frieden, who ran the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for eight years, wrote an op-ed for the health care publication Stat. In it, Frieden warned that the virus would continue spreading. “We need to learn — and fast — about how it spreads,” he wrote. It was one of many such warnings from prominent experts in late January. Many focused on the need to expand the capacity to test for the virus. In a Wall Street Journal article titled, “Act Now to Prevent an American Epidemic,” Luciana Borio and Scott Gottlieb — both former Trump administration officials — wrote: If public-health authorities don’t interrupt the spread soon, the virus could infect many thousands more around the globe, disrupt air travel, overwhelm health care systems, and, worst of all, claim more lives. The good news: There’s still an opening to prevent a grim outcome. … But authorities can’t act quickly without a test that can diagnose the condition rapidly. Trump, however, repeatedly told Americans that there was no reason to worry. On Jan. 24, he tweeted, “It will all work out well.” On Jan. 28, he retweeted a headline from One America News, an outlet with a history of spreading false conspiracy theories: “Johnson & Johnson to create coronavirus vaccine.” On Jan. 30, during a speech in Michigan, he said: “We have it very well under control. We have very little problem in this country at this moment — five. And those people are all recuperating successfully.” That same day, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus to be a “public-health emergency of international concern.” It announced 7,818 confirmed cases around the world."
33,33,true/false,"A NATION CHALLENGED: THE VAULT; Below Ground Zero, Silver and Gold Correction Appended  About two weeks ago, a security team spotted scorch marks on a basement doorway below 4 World Trade Center, on the east side of the ruined complex, according to officials.  Even in a place of mass devastation and death, those scorch marks got fast attention. They had not been noticed by a patrol team a few hours earlier, and behind the damaged -- but intact -- door were nearly a thousand tons of gold and silver. To security officials, it looked as if someone had tried to break in.  Within hours, a video surveillance system was installed to keep at least an electronic eye on the precious metals until their custodian, the Bank of Nova Scotia, had a chance to remove them. That work began this week.  A team of 30 firefighters and police officers are helping to move the metals, a task that can be measured practically down to the flake but that has been rounded off at 379,036 ounces of gold and 29,942,619 ounces of silver.  As layers of debris are peeled away, recovery workers are opening gangways to intact portions of a 16-acre basement that was largely unseen but was a place of spectacular scope in its own right. Just the basement area of the World Trade Center enclosed twice as much space as the entire Empire State Building.  Nearly a quarter of a mile below the spectacular vistas from the towers was their upside-down attic dropping 70 feet below the ground, a strange world with enough room for fortunes in gold and silver, for Godiva chocolates, assault weapons, old furniture, bricks of cocaine, phony taxicabs and Central Intelligence Agency files. With so many people still lost, the owners of this stuff have maintained a discreet silence during the recovery operations. But that doesn't mean they're not interested.  Beneath the Customs House -- 6 World Trade Center -- was an armada of government vehicles, including dozens owned by the Secret Service, in a fenced-off area. Within that area was a garage where a single armored limousine was parked under the tightest security.  The limousine was so long that it needed straight-line access to the street, because it could not clear tight corners in the basement.  That car had been used to carry heads of state visiting the city, said Tony Ball, a spokesman for the Secret Service. (The president's limousines are stored in Washington and flown everywhere he visits.)  In the 1993 trade center bombing, an armored Secret Service limousine was parked about 100 feet from a truck bomb. Although the bomb crashed through five stories of concrete and the concussion destroyed cars all over that floor, the Secret Service limousine ''did not even have a broken windshield,'' according to a government official on the scene that day. The condition of the limousine after September's attack was not known yesterday. ''We haven't gotten anything back yet,'' Mr. Ball said.  Asked about reports that his agency also kept what looked like ordinary taxis and telephone company trucks in the basement, Mr. Ball laughed. ''What I would say is that it is not unusual for law enforcement agencies to have these kinds of things,'' he said.  Besides the Secret Service, the building named for the United States Customs Service also housed an office of the C.I.A.  That building is now partly collapsed, with a rubble pit 30 feet deep. Somewhere in there are drugs, weapons and contraband seized by the Customs Service at the region's airports. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms also lost two evidence vaults, according to a spokesman for that agency, Joseph Green. They have not yet been recovered.  ''There could be several hundred weapons -- somewhere between 200 and 400, ranging from small-caliber semiautomatic pistols to assault rifles,'' Mr. Green said, adding that a few of the guns had been found. Agents plan to be on the scene when the remains of the building are demolished sometime in the next two weeks, he said.  ''After that, we'll be working at the landfill to search for any important items that are still missing.''  For people who have seen the surface destruction, either in pictures or in person, it may be hard to imagine that anything is intact below ground. But engineers and recovery officials say that large parts of the underground perimeter are undamaged, even though the buildings above them are partly collapsed.  One area is below 4 World Trade Center, where more than two decades ago, Swiss Bank built a huge vault and storage area. The vault was reached from the Swiss Bank offices by a private elevator.  To reach the vaults, armored trucks would drive through what had once been the tunnels for the Hudson and Manhattan railroad, the predecessor of the PATH system. These tunnels had run as far east as Church Street, but were not needed when the trade center was built and the PATH terminal was set closer to the river.  The western stubs of the original tunnels, ringed with cast iron, were converted into roadways. These roads ran directly to a roll-down door in front of the Swiss Bank vault area. Inside was a loading dock.  By the time of the 1993 bombing, Swiss Bank no longer was using the vault, and shortly afterward, the bank relocated its remaining operations.  The next tenant of the vault space was the Bank of Nova Scotia, which estimated the value of the metals at $200 million.  ''We are in the process of relocating the contents of our vault at World Trade Center building No. 4 to another secure location, because authorities need to demolish the building,'' Pam Agnew, a spokeswoman for the bank, said yesterday by phone from Toronto.  Some of the metal is owned by the bank, and some by its customers, she said. She declined to say where the metals were being taken.  ''The contents remain safe and intact,'' Ms. Agnew said. ''The contents are fully insured. We're working very closely with local authorities to ensure a safe and secure relocation effort.  ''The removal of the contents was not a priority for us because we've always known it was safe and secure,'' Ms. Agnew said.  Asked about what appeared to be an attempted break-in two weeks ago, Ms. Agnew said that she was unaware of it. Later, she called to reiterate that the metals were safe: ''It would be factually incorrect to say there had been any attempt to steal the contents of our vault.''  However, a government official involved in the recovery efforts said that there had clearly been an attempt within the last two weeks to enter the vault area. ''It looked like they used a blowtorch, a crowbar,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition that neither his name nor his position be identified. ''The Port Authority police began periodic patrols, and then a closed-circuit television system was put in.''  The bank also engaged Kroll Inc., a security business based in New York, to supervise the relocation of the gold and silver, a process that began this week, The Daily News reported yesterday.  Michael Cherkasky, the president of Kroll, declined to comment on his company's involvement.  Anyone trying to make off with the gold would not be able to run very fast: each ingot weighs 70 pounds.

The children of the Windrush generation who are in the UK will in most cases be British citizens already, but where that is not the case, they will be able to apply to naturalise at no further cost.  We are also taking action in relation to those who made their life here but retired to their country of origin and have found it difficult or impossible to return to the UK. We will work with high commissions to make sure that they can easily access the offer of formal British citizenship, because the Windrush generation are British; they are part of us.

35,35,true/false,"Members of the House Are on Notice: No Tweeting Deepfakes You might have missed it amid all the sound and fury of impeachment, but it’s been a busy week for disinformation. Twitter, the Wall Street Journal reports, will start removing posts that it determines are “misleading about an election.” Elizabeth Warren’s campaign rolled out a plan on “Fighting Digital Disinformation,” including a pledge not to “knowingly use or spread false or manipulated information.” And the House Ethics Committee announced that members of the House of Representatives who share deepfakes on social media might face sanctions from the House itself. The ethics announcement attracted the least attention of all, but it’s actually an important step in creating standards for how elected representatives should use social media.  This news might seem trivial compared to the drama of the impeachment trial going on just down the street. But as technology companies and governments alike grapple with how to address the spread of online falsehoods, the committee’s memo is noteworthy. Four years after the shock to the system of 2016, everyone agrees that disinformation and misinformation are problems that need to be dealt with, but the question remains who is best positioned to accept responsibility. The House of Representatives appears to be, in some small way, beginning to take on the task.  The committee’s “pink sheet”—an advisory memorandum on House rules—alerts members of the House to the dangers of posting deepfakes on social media, warning that “manipulation of images and videos that are intended to mislead the public can harm … discourse and reflect discreditably on the House.” For this reason, disseminating “deep fakes or other audio-visual distortions intended to mislead the public” could violate the House’s Code of Official Conduct, which governs the behavior of the chamber’s members and employees.  This might sound like the committee is addressing a problem that doesn’t exist yet. As far as we know, there have not been any cases in which a member of Congress—or any other prominent American political figure—has tweeted a genuine deepfake, meaning doctored audio or video generated through machine learning than can produce extremely lifelike and misleading results. After all, deepfakes—though concerning—just aren’t all that common in politics (yet).  Politicians have, however, published plenty of what the memorandum describes as “other audio-visual distortions”—that is, photos or video deceptively manipulated in a less sophisticated manner than a deepfake. Sometimes the manipulation is obvious: President Trump recently tweeted a picture altered to depict him putting a Medal of Honor around the neck of a dog that played a role in the raid on Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (the original photo showed the president bestowing the medal to a Vietnam War medic). But U.S. political figures have published more deceptive images, too. Three days after the strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, Rep. Paul Gosar tweeted a photo appearing to show President Obama shaking hands with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani; it took 40 minutes before he acknowledged that the picture was actually a fake, a doctored version of a shot from a 2011 meeting between Obama and then-Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.  The world is a better place without these guys in power. pic.twitter.com/gDoXQu9vO5 — Paul Gosar (@DrPaulGosar) January 6, 2020  It’s easy to see why the committee might be particularly concerned about these manipulations now. Quoting a Congressional Research Service article on deepfakes, the memo warns that when members of the House or their staff tweet or share deepfakes or other manipulated audio or video, they could “erode public trust, negatively affect public discourse, or even sway an election.” Consider, for example, the misleadingly edited video tweeted out by President Trump in May 2019 that appeared to display Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi slurring her words at a news conference—or the wide circulation of a deceptive clip that seemed to show Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden make a racist remark. Now imagine such a clip, with sophisticated editing or not, circulated in the days or even hours before an election—and given the appearance of legitimacy by retweets from members of Congress and perhaps even the president himself.  The memo changes the calculation for members: Tweet misleading content, and you could be subject to House disciplinary rules. The Ethics Committee asks members and staff to think before they tweet: Before posting on social media, “[m]embers and staff are expected to take reasonable efforts to consider whether such representations are deep fakes or are intentionally distorted to mislead the public.” Members who break this guidance could be subject to public admonition by the committee of the offending members. Technically, the full House could even censure members—or expel them for violation of House rules.  Censure is unlikely, though, and expulsion even less so. Only five members have ever met the latter fate, three of whom were expelled for fighting for the Confederacy. Tweeting a deepfake may be harmful to democracy, but it might not be quite the same as taking up arms against the republic.  More realistically, the committee may hope that the guideline itself will have a deterrent effect. The committee is often reluctant to discipline members, so the most realistic deterrent may come from members’ desire to avoid scrutiny from the Office of Congressional Ethics, which investigates and produces public reports about ethics violations. As former senior counsel to the House Michael L. Stern, told us, “[T]he primary motivation for complying with this edict is not the formal sanction, but the embarrassment of getting called out for violations, as well as the desire to avoid an investigation” by either the committee or the independent Office of Congressional Ethics.  In this way, the pink sheet is a norm-setting exercise for the House—and a bipartisan one, as the committee is the only one in the House evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. When members tweet doctored pictures or share altered videos, they now do so as knowing violators of the House’s position on this type of content.  So the guidelines set out in the memo might not have that much bite. Yet they still represent a shift from the current state of things—which is to say, an ad hoc system in which tech platforms are effectively building the content moderation plane in midair, setting out broad rules and then struggling to decide the extent to which politicians get special treatment. The result of these efforts has been that, by and large, citizens and users of the major platforms have come to think of the platforms themselves as the governing bodies to whom appeals should be addressed when a prominent political figure publishes misleading or objectionable content. Every time President Trump posts a threat on Twitter, for example, hundreds of other users will tweet at Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and other executives demanding to know why the platform won’t remove content that appears to violate its terms of service.  Hey @Twitter, is threatening nuclear war not a violation of terms of service? https://t.co/Gwz2EZHKnu — Kal Penn (@kalpenn) August 11, 2017  The situation has become so commonplace that it may no longer seem strange. But there is something bizarre about the notion that private platforms not only can regulate what and how politicians communicate with their constituents and the rest of the world, but that those platforms should. As any number of scholars and journalists have pointed out, the responsibility of deciding what speech is and is not within the bounds of acceptable discourse is, on its face, a task better suited to democratic governance than private enterprise. The Ethics Committee guidance is a small step toward governmental institutions accepting at least some of that burden.  That said, the House shouldering part of that weight means that the chamber will now have to grapple with some of the puzzling content moderation questions that only platforms have dealt with until now. Just as Twitter or Facebook users whose content is removed will appeal to the platforms to argue that their posts don’t violate the terms of service, surely the Ethics Committee and the Office of Congressional Ethics are going to be faced with the problem of assessing whether a member or staffer has actually violated the rule. Recall that the memo’s prohibition includes an intent requirement—so a member who shares a deepfake could argue that he or she too was duped, or explain that the shared deepfake was not a deception, but merely a joke. In fact, after he published the fake image of Obama shaking hands with Rouhani, that’s exactly what Gosar did: “[N]o one said this wasn’t photoshopped. No one said the president of Iran was dead. No one said Obama met with Rouhani in person,” Gosar wrote.  Then there are the new questions that emerge from two sets of overlapping rules between the House and the platforms, which will create headaches for both parties. Platforms are likely to face two situations: those in which a member spreads misleading content that appears to violate the terms of the memo and the House does nothing, and those in which the House issues some sort of sanction.  In the first case, where a member spreads misleading content but the committee takes no action, there will no doubt still be calls—as there are every time something similar happens—for platforms to do something. These calls are natural: Platforms have the greatest capacity to stop the spread of content on their services by using their content moderation infrastructure, and so it feels like they should exercise it. But, as noted above, it is jarring to ask a private company, with no democratic mandate or legitimacy, to take action against the speech of a public representative when the House Committee on Ethics itself has not done so. This situation appears to be a lose-lose for platforms: Take no action and they will continue to face charges of negligence in their roles at gatekeepers; do something and they will appear to be usurping the role of the committee to police the boundaries of acceptable conduct by elected representatives.  The second case isn’t easy either. Where a particular post has resulted in sanction from the committee, what should platforms do to best facilitate democratic accountability? Continuing to allow false content to spread might allow it to continue to do harm. But removing a post by a representative could prevent constituents from holding their member of Congress accountable, because fewer people will be aware of the post in the first place.  This situation calls for thinking outside the binary of taking down content or leaving it up, which platforms are starting to show in other cases—like flagging content that has been rated false by fact-checkers, or Twitter’s (as yet unused) policy of placing warning screens on content that breaks its rules but is in the public interest. When it comes to deepfakes and other “synthetic and manipulated media,” for example, Twitter has proposed placing a notice next to such posts or adding some other kind of warning, which could mesh well with whatever action the committee takes. Similarly, platforms could reduce circulation of misleading content that is the subject of committee censure and add context noting the committee’s action.  And, as ever, there’s the little matter of what to do about the president. The Ethics Committee can pass whatever rules it likes for members, but that’s not going to stop Trump from tweeting and retweeting. What happens if, for example, members of the House retweet a Trump tweet containing a misleadingly edited video? The members might be censured while the president would remain untouched.  Then again, perhaps this mirrors the struggles of Twitter itself: Puzzled by how to handle presidential tweets, the platform has written into its terms of service an exception for “newsworthiness,” which essentially allows Trump to publish whatever he likes. (Other platforms have similar rules.) Of course, the House has no power over Trump’s Twitter feed, and while the platform could limit his tweets if it wanted, it has decided not to.  The Ethics Committee is now going to get a taste of the absurdities and contradictions of regulating social media. We’ll have to wait and see whether Twitter users start tweeting at the committee as well as @jack and asking that congressional tweets be taken down—or demanding to know why members have been unjustly punished."
36,36,true/false,"The UK’s new Trade Agreements: Curb your Enthusiasm « UK Trade Policy Observatory The UK’s new Trade Agreements: Curb your Enthusiasm  Share this article:  8 November 2021  L. Alan Winters is Professor of Economics and Founding Director of the UKTP0 and Guillermo Larbalestier is Research Assistant in International Trade at the University of Sussex and Fellow of the UKTPO.  Key Findings:  To date, the UK government has signed no new trade agreements relative to what it would have had as a continuing member of the EU.  The Government estimates that the two agreements in principle announced this year (Australia and New Zealand) will increase UK Gross Domestic Product by between £200 and £500 million annually – that is, 0.01% to 0.02% (one to two ten-thousandths) of GDP or between £3 and £7 per head of population – and that only after they have bedded down over 15 years or so .  We were asked to sum up the economic benefits of the UK’s new post-Brexit trade agreements. Our first observation is that if we take as a starting point the trade agreements that the UK would have been party to as a member of the EU, the government has, to date, signed no new trade agreements!  There are two new trade agreements in principle. That with Australia was announced in June 2021 but has not yet been finalised, and that with New Zealand was announced last month. As the full details of these agreements have not yet been released (or perhaps determined), we do not know what their effects will be, but in June and July 2020 the government’s preliminary analysis (which is not likely to be an underestimate of the worth of the agreements) suggested that in the long run, the trade deal with Australia will raise UK GDP by between £200 and £500 million annually – that is, 0.01% to 0.02% (one to two ten-thousandths) of GDP or between £3 and £7 per head of population. The trade agreement with New Zealand is estimated to raise GDP by basically zero – minus 0.01% to plus 0.01%. (The long run ‘is generally assumed to represent around 15 years from implementation of the agreement.’)  Government analysis also treats the agreement with Japan (the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement – CEPA) as new because the EU’s agreement was not fully operational when it was undertaken. In fact, however, CEPA is modelled extremely closely on the EU-Japan agreement, with a few small differences. These include extensions on, e.g., digital trade, and one major loss – the inability of UK exporters to the EU to be able to count Japanese parts towards meeting the EU’s requirements for getting zero-tariff entry to the EU. Relative to having no agreement, the government estimated that CEPA would raise UK GDP by £1.5 billion (0.07% or £22 per head), but relative to what the UK would have had without Brexit the gains will be negligible or negative.  Parts (A) and (B) of the table below give the numbers in more detail, along with estimates from the same sources of the effects of these agreements on UK exports and imports with the partners. Of course, all modelling results are uncertain, but the ranges quoted reflect the different trade liberalisation scenarios assumed in the government’s analysis. Thus, for example, the UK-Australia deal would raise UK exports by 3.6% under a ‘substantial’ trade liberalisation and by 7.3% under an even more ambitious one. [One can also see that increases in imports are predicted to substantially exceed those in exports, but that is a story for another occasion.]  The changes in trade with the partners look impressive, but remember two key facts:  A trade agreement will divert some trade to, say, Australia from other partners, so total UK trade will increase by less, and  Australia and New Zealand are small trading partners, accounting for 1.7% and 0.2% of UK exports and 1.0% and 0.2% of UK imports respectively (in 2019).  But the small shares of overall UK trade are not enough to explain the modest impacts. Even the proposed UK-US trade agreement, shown in part (C) and a key aspiration of the Government, was estimated to increase UK GDP by only a modest 0.07%-0.16%. Bear in mind that the US is the UK’s largest single-country trading partner accounting for 20.5% and 17.9% of total exports and imports, respectively, in 2019.  The UK has also signed nearly 70 other agreements that are new to the UK, but which are designed as closely as possible ‘to reproduce the effects of trading agreements that previously applied’ when the UK was a member of the EU. They add nothing to UK trade, and, because they are not perfect replicas, actually harm it very slightly.  The issue is not that trade agreements are worth nothing, but that they barely scratch the surface of the UK’s challenge to make up the GDP lost by leaving the EU, which the Office for Budget Responsibility puts at 4%.  Thus, one might ask ‘if the effects are so small, why bother?’ Among the possible answers are that:  a) while each agreement is small, cumulatively they could sum to a significant amount,  b) the current agreements could be stepping stones to bigger, regional agreements, such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership,  c) there are other impacts beyond GDP and trade, such as on longer-run innovation, investment and productivity impacts, which the assessments are not good at capturing,  d) there may be specific sectoral access issues;  e) there may be additional non-trade objectives related to climate and the environment, for example.  None of these is convincing economically. On (a) and (b), non-EU partners account for about half of UK total trade and so, to counteract the OBR’s 4% loss from Brexit, would require agreements with each and every one of them to induce trade changes that create a 4% increment to UK GDP. That is nowhere in sight in the numbers in the table.  Answer (c) is conceivably true but there has been no such evidence and one would have to explain why agreements with non-EU countries would have this effect while a deeper agreement with the EU would not. Similarly, on (d), there certainly are disproportionate gainers from these agreements, but what are they and why do we preference them? On (e), again it is conceivably true, but the dilution of the climate clauses with Australia suggests the opposite.  The sad answer is that  f) the government is happy to accept, on our behalf, the economic losses from Brexit in return for political benefits (sovereignty), and trade agreements with other countries are merely making the best of a bad job from an economic perspective.

37,37,true/false,"Russia's economy chief explores the Trump phenomenon, sees re-election in 2020 Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic. Some coronavirus victims could be temporarily buried in the Hart Island potter’s field — or even public parks — if New York’s morgues become overwhelmed by the number of dead, officials said Monday. They floated the heart-wrenching option as the city death toll climbed to 2,738 and the caseload hit 68,776 — accounting for more than half of the Empire State’s 4,758 fatalities and 130,689 cases. “We may well be dealing with temporary burials so we can deal with each family later,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio in a press briefing at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. “Obviously the place we have used historically is Hart Island.” Located in the Long Island Sound off The Bronx’s southeast coast, the desolate spit of land is the nation’s largest public burial ground, with a macabre history. It has hosted a Civil War prison camp, a colony for tuberculosis patients, and became the resting place for thousands of HIV/AIDS victims during the 1980s who were abandoned by families or unable to receive proper burials. De Blasio — who has been loath to publicly discuss how New York would handle the overwhelming body count — faced the ghastly reality after City Councilman Mark Levine raised an even more dire possibility. “Soon we’ll start ‘temporary interment.’ This likely will be done by using a NYC park for burials (yes you read that right),” the Manhattan Democrat tweeted prior to de Blasio’s remarks. “Trenches will be dug for 10 caskets in a line. “It will be done in a dignified, orderly — and temporary — manner. But it will be tough for NYers to take.” Levine, chair of the council’s Health Committee, clarified in a later tweet that the plan to convert parks into makeshift cemeteries was a “contingency,” and City Hall said it wasn’t happening — for now. “We are NOT currently planning to use local parks as burial grounds,” tweeted mayoral rep Freddi Goldstein. “We are exploring using Hart Island for temporary burials, if the need grows.” As New Yorkers were still dying by the hundreds, Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday again voiced guarded optimism that the wave may be cresting. After a record 630 deaths were logged Saturday, the number fell to 594 Sunday, and stayed “effectively flat” with 599 on Monday. “The flattening — possible flattening — of the curve is better than the increases that we have seen,” said Cuomo in his daily Albany press briefing. Longtime Cuomo aide Dr. Jim Malatras agreed that New York may be turning a corner. “This could suggest that we are indeed, potentially, at the apex,” said Malatras, while cautioning that this is far from over. “It looks like we are towards the earlier side of the projection.” If the disease is truly hitting its apex, it comes just in time for New York’s overtaxed hospitals. “This is a hospital system where we have our foot to the floor,” Cuomo said. “The engine is at redline, and you can’t go any faster. You can’t stay at redline for any period of time, because the system will blow.” To ease the pressure, President Trump on Monday granted Cuomo’s request for the hospital ship docked along Manhattan’s West Side — the USNS Comfort — to take on COVID-19 patients. The 1,000-bed vessel was originally reserved for non-coronavirus patients, but hadn’t seen many cases in the shut-down city. “That is a welcome relief,” Cuomo told MSNBC of the move.

38,38,true/false,"FDA Takes Key Action in Fight Against COVID-19 By Issuing Emergency Use Authorization for First COVID-19 Vaccine Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued the first emergency use authorization (EUA) for a vaccine for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 16 years of age and older. The emergency use authorization allows the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to be distributed in the U.S. “The FDA’s authorization for emergency use of the first COVID-19 vaccine is a significant milestone in battling this devastating pandemic that has affected so many families in the United States and around the world,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “Today’s action follows an open and transparent review process that included input from independent scientific and public health experts and a thorough evaluation by the agency’s career scientists to ensure this vaccine met FDA’s rigorous, scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization. The tireless work to develop a new vaccine to prevent this novel, serious, and life-threatening disease in an expedited timeframe after its emergence is a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide.” The FDA has determined that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has met the statutory criteria for issuance of an EUA. The totality of the available data provides clear evidence that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine may be effective in preventing COVID-19. The data also support that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks, supporting the vaccine’s use in millions of people 16 years of age and older, including healthy individuals. In making this determination, the FDA can assure the public and medical community that it has conducted a thorough evaluation of the available safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality information. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine contains messenger RNA (mRNA), which is genetic material. The vaccine contains a small piece of the SARS-CoV-2 virus’s mRNA that instructs cells in the body to make the virus’s distinctive “spike” protein. When a person receives this vaccine, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease, but triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against SARS-CoV-2. “While not an FDA approval, today’s emergency use authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine holds the promise to alter the course of this pandemic in the United States,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “With science guiding our decision-making, the available safety and effectiveness data support the authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine because the vaccine’s known and potential benefits clearly outweigh its known and potential risks. The data provided by the sponsor have met the FDA’s expectations as conveyed in our June and October guidance documents. Efforts to speed vaccine development have not sacrificed scientific standards or the integrity of our vaccine evaluation process. The FDA’s review process also included public and independent review from members of the agency’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. Today’s achievement is ultimately a testament to the commitment of our career scientists and physicians, who worked tirelessly to thoroughly evaluate the data and information for this vaccine.” FDA Evaluation of Available Safety Data Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is administered as a series of two doses, three weeks apart. The available safety data to support the EUA include 37,586 of the participants enrolled in an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled international study, the majority of whom are U.S. participants. These participants, 18,801 of whom received the vaccine and 18,785 of whom received saline placebo, were followed for a median of two months after receiving the second dose. The most commonly reported side effects, which typically lasted several days, were pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, and fever. Of note, more people experienced these side effects after the second dose than after the first dose, so it is important for vaccination providers and recipients to expect that there may be some side effects after either dose, but even more so after the second dose. It is mandatory for Pfizer Inc. and vaccination providers to report the following to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine: all vaccine administration errors, serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS), and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death. FDA Evaluation of Available Effectiveness Data The effectiveness data to support the EUA include an analysis of 36,523 participants in the ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled international study, the majority of whom are U.S. participants, who did not have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection through seven days after the second dose. Among these participants, 18,198 received the vaccine and 18,325 received placebo. The vaccine was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19 disease among these clinical trial participants with eight COVID-19 cases in the vaccine group and 162 in the placebo group. Of these 170 COVID-19 cases, one in the vaccine group and three in the placebo group were classified as severe. At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person. The EUA Process On the basis of the determination by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services on February 4, 2020, that there is a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad, and then issued declarations that  circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of unapproved products, the FDA may issue an EUA to allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent COVID-19 when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. The issuance of an EUA is different than an FDA approval (licensure) of a vaccine. In determining whether to issue an EUA for a product, the FDA evaluates the available evidence and assesses any known or potential risks and any known or potential benefits, and if the benefit-risk assessment is favorable, the product is made available during the emergency. Once a manufacturer submits an EUA request for a COVID-19 vaccine to the FDA, the agency then evaluates the request and determines whether the relevant statutory criteria are met, taking into account the totality of the scientific evidence about the vaccine that is available to the FDA. The EUA also requires that fact sheets that provide important information, including dosing instructions, and information about the benefits and risks of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, be made available to vaccination providers and vaccine recipients. The company has submitted a pharmacovigilance plan to FDA to monitor the safety of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The pharmacovigilance plan includes a plan to complete longer-term safety follow-up for participants enrolled in ongoing clinical trials. The pharmacovigilance plan also includes other activities aimed at monitoring the safety profile of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and ensuring that any safety concerns are identified and evaluated in a timely manner. The FDA also expects manufacturers whose COVID-19 vaccines are authorized under an EUA to continue their clinical trials to obtain additional safety and effectiveness information and pursue approval (licensure). The EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was issued to Pfizer Inc. The EUA will be effective until the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biologics for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is terminated, and may be revised or revoked if it is determined the EUA no longer meets the statutory criteria for issuance. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products."
39,39,true/false,"Details emerge of Vaccine Choice Canada lawsuit over coronavirus response CBC News has obtained an unredacted copy of a lawsuit launched by an anti-vaccination advocacy group against the government response to the coronavirus crisis, the details of which can now be independently verified and publicly reported for the first time.  The lawsuit was filed July 6 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Toronto by Aylmer, Ont.-based Vaccine Choice Canada and seven individuals. The legal action is a challenge under Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms to the country's pandemic response measures, including compulsory face masks, the closure of businesses and the enforcement of physical distancing.  The plaintiffs are suing the governments of Canada and Ontario, the City of Toronto, senior politicians, a number of local Ontario health authorities, health officials and the CBC over their response to the pandemic.  The suit states that the closure of businesses to prevent the spread of the virus was ""extreme, unwarranted and unjustified,"" that self-isolation measures imposed on individuals were ""not scientific, nor medically based nor proven"" and that the mandatory wearing of face coverings in some public spaces imposes ""physical and psychological harm.""  The lawsuit alleges that the measures violate Sections 2 (right of association), 7 (life, liberty and security of the person), 8 (unlawful search and seizure), 9 (arbitrary detention of enforcement officers) and 15 (equality before and under the law) of the charter.  ""The measures ... are further not in accordance with the tenets of fundamental justice in their overbreadth, nor are they justified under S.1 of the charter in that they are demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society,"" the lawsuit states.  Vaccine Choice Canada describes itself as a watchdog organization whose mandate is ""to empower families to make educated, voluntary, and informed decisions about vaccination,"" but public health authorities have criticized the group for spreading false or misleading information about vaccines and immunization.  Names of plaintiffs redacted for fear of harassment  While copies of the 191-page statement of claim exist online, the names and stories of some of the individual plaintiffs have been redacted on the documents by the plaintiffs themselves. Social media posts from Rocco Galati, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said it was done out of precaution to protect the individuals from harassment.  Here is the statement of claim filed in Ontario Superior Court.<a href=""https://t.co/rULDUrXdQe"">https://t.co/rULDUrXdQe</a><br><br>Some of the plaintiffs' names have been redacted to protect them from harassment. —@roccogalatilaw  CBC News has agreed not to name the individuals, who range from a former professor to working parents, a chiropractor and people living with chronic illnesses or disabilities.  No date has been set for when the case will go to court, and it's unclear whether a judge will allow it to proceed.  The lawsuit is seeking $1 million in general damages and $10 million in punitive damages, plus legal costs.  No statements of defence have been filed in the case.  Legal scholar says lawsuit has claims worth examining  Among the personal stories contained in the statement of claim is that of a 23-year-old Hamilton man with autism who has the emotional capacity of a four-year-old. His guardian claims in the suit that the man doesn't have the capacity to understand pandemic health measures, which have ""totally mentally devastated"" him by depriving him of his routines and his social and emotional network.  Another account is of a Mississauga woman who says she can't wear a mask because it triggers a traumatic memory of having a mask forcibly held over her face during a sexual assault.  Protesters gather outside the Ontario Legislature in Toronto in May to demonstrate against government actions related to the coronavirus pandemic. (Chris Young/The Canadian Press)  The claim states the woman is often faced with a choice when she goes out in public without a mask: risk being embarrassed by disclosing her private history or be denied service at local businesses.  ""I don't think we need to violate people's privacy or have them disclose medical conditions, particularly in the context of a private business,"" said Jacob Shelley, an assistant professor of health law and ethics at Western University in London, Ont., who examined an unredacted copy of the lawsuit provided by CBC News.  ""We need to have a discussion about what does it mean to mandate masks. What does it mean to have everyone wear masks when you're indoors and you can't socially distance, because I think there are going to be legitimate instances where people are going to be unable or unwilling to wear a mask for reasons that really are their own.  ""There's lucid, valid, potential issues that maybe are worth being adjudicated before the court.""  A sign encouraging physical distancing at Union Station in Toronto. The City of Toronto is one of the parties named in the suit. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)  Shelley said given the content of the lawsuit, a public debate over masks risks being overshadowed by other claims that aren't supported by science.  ""The 'pandemic' is false, and the measures phony, designed and implemented for improper and ulterior purposes, at the behest of the WHO, controlled and directed by billionaire, corporate oligarchs,"" the statement of claim says.  ""The plaintiffs state, and the fact is, that the evidence is that far many more people have died as a result of the 'pandemic' measures themselves than purportedly from the 'COVID-19 deaths,' even if one takes the deaths 'caused' by COVID as a given.""

""Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology report the development of a novel way to record a patient's vaccination history by using smartphone-readable nano crystals called 'quantum dots,' embedded in the skin using micro-needles. In short, a vaccine chip embedded in the body. This work and research are funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,"" the lawsuit said.  The statement of claim includes a timeline that begins in the year 2000 when Bill Gates steps down as the head of Microsoft to start the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It also states Gates expects a ""'twenty-fold' return on his $10 billion vaccine investment within the next few decades.""  Included in the timeline are references to the Chinese military, 5G networks, international vaccine programs and the Rockefeller Foundation as relevant to the creation and spread of the coronavirus, but the lawsuit isn't clear on how.  Shelley said including such references in the statement of claim without providing supporting scientific evidence could ultimately be what gets the suit dismissed before it goes to trial under Ontario's rules of civil procedure.  Toronto lawyer Rocco Galati, who is representing plaintiffs in the suit, initially agreed to speak to CBC News but then did not respond to follow-up requests for comment. (Trevor Hagan/The Canadian Press)  CBC News reached out multiple times to Galati, who is listed as the spokesperson for the lawsuit in a press release issued by Vaccine Choice Canada. He spoke with a reporter last Wednesday but did not agree to an on-the-record interview.  Galati told CBC News he would be available last Thursday for a recorded interview but did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday or the following Monday.  The CBC has also been named as a defendant in the lawsuit for allegedly propagating misinformation and ""false news"" about the coronavirus crisis.

40,40,true/false,"White House blames Boris Johnson after U.S. press corps denied opportunity to ask questions Members of the White House press corps filed a formal complaint after a meeting between President Biden and the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ended with questions only from members of the British press. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Yet the White House appeared to point the finger at Johnson, insisting the British leader was responsible for the seemingly chaotic scenes in the Oval Office by springing an unplanned news conference.  “He [Johnson] called on individuals from his press corps without alerting us to that intention in advance,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday when asked about the incident.  “I think our relationship with the United Kingdom and with Prime Minister Johnson is so strong and abiding, we will be able to move forward beyond this,” she added.  Biden on Tuesday wished Johnson “good luck” when the British leader attempted to take questions from the media.  President Biden met with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the White House on Sept. 21 to discuss the countries' shared goals. (Video: The Washington Post, Photo: The Washington Post)  Johnson then called on a handful of British reporters for questions — and when their American counterparts attempted to raise their own, the whole media scrum was ushered out of the room.  Advertisement  CBS News Radio’s White House correspondent Steven Portnoy, who is also president of the White House Correspondents’ Association, said in a pool report dispatch on Tuesday that “the entire editorial component of the US pool went immediately into Jen Psaki’s office to register a formal complaint that no American reporters were recognized for questions in the president’s Oval Office.”  Psaki noted that the president takes press questions several times a week, he added.  A day later on Wednesday, Psaki batted away any notion that Biden had felt “upstaged” by the British prime minister, telling reporters, “I think the president has not spent a moment worrying about it.”  IN THE PRESIDENT'S OVAL OFFICE:    Boris Johnson recognized two British reporters for questions.    Joe Biden then signaled it was time for the press to leave, without taking any questions from his own press corps. — Steven Portnoy (@stevenportnoy) September 21, 2021  Biden ruffled some feathers among the press corps in the early days of his presidency when he waited more than two months after his inauguration to hold his first news conference in March — longer than any of his predecessors in the past 100 years.  Advertisement  The Washington Post’s White House bureau chief, Ashley Parker, also highlighted after the Biden meeting with Johnson that “respect for a free press” was “a key tenet of a flourishing democracy.”  Worth noting that Biden ran for office promising to restore democracy after 4 years of Trump. But today it was the British leader, NOT the American one, who spotlighted a key tenet of a flourishing democracy — respect for a free press — by taking questions from his press corps. — Ashley Parker (@AshleyRParker) September 21, 2021  Submitting to substantial questioning and news conferences serve as a crucial venue for the media to probe and publicly hold to account the power of the presidency, which Psaki said Biden recognized as “vitally important to our democracy.”  “The President knows that he was elected not to just get the pandemic under control and put people back to work, but protect our democracy and stand up for what’s right and be transparent,” Psaki said Wednesday. “And, certainly, part of that is engaging with all of you.”  Meanwhile, the British prime minister’s office has yet to comment on the White House’s remarks and did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Post.

41,41,true/false,"Rain fell at the normally snowy summit of Greenland for the first time on record (CNN) For the first time on record, precipitation on Saturday at the summit of Greenland — roughly two miles above sea level — fell as rain and not snow.  Temperatures at the Greenland summit over the weekend rose above freezing for the third time in less than a decade. The warm air fueled an extreme rain event that dumped 7 billion tons of water on the ice sheet, enough to fill the Reflecting Pool at the National Mall in Washington, DC, nearly 250,000 times.  It was the heaviest rainfall on the ice sheet since record keeping began in 1950, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center , and the amount of ice mass lost on Sunday was seven times higher than normal for this time of year.  Ted Scambos, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado, said this is evidence Greenland is warming rapidly.  ""What is going on is not simply a warm decade or two in a wandering climate pattern,"" Scambos told CNN. ""This is unprecedented.""  Read More"
42,42,true/false,"ESA Science & Technology - Earth's atmosphere stretches out to the Moon &ndash; and beyond Earth's atmosphere stretches out to the Moon – and beyond  20 February 2019  A recent discovery based on observations by the ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, SOHO, shows that the gaseous layer that wraps around Earth reaches up to 630 000 km away, or 50 times the diameter of our planet.  ""The Moon flies through Earth's atmosphere,"" says Igor Baliukin of Russia's Space Research Institute, lead author of the paper presenting the results.  ""We were not aware of it until we dusted off observations made over two decades ago by the SOHO spacecraft.""  Where our atmosphere merges into outer space, there is a cloud of hydrogen atoms called the geocorona. One of the spacecraft instruments, SWAN, used its sensitive sensors to trace the hydrogen signature and precisely detect how far the very outskirts of the geocorona are.  These observations could be done only at certain times of the year, when the Earth and its geocorona came into view for SWAN.  For planets with hydrogen in their exospheres, water vapour is often seen closer to their surface. That is the case for Earth, Mars and Venus.  ""This is especially interesting when looking for planets with potential reservoirs of water beyond our Solar System,"" explains Jean-Loup Bertaux, co-author and former principal investigator of SWAN.  The first telescope on the Moon, placed by Apollo 16 astronauts in 1972, captured an evocative image of the geocorona surrounding Earth and glowing brightly in ultraviolet light.  ""At that time, the astronauts on the lunar surface did not know that they were actually embedded in the outskirts of the geocorona,"" says Jean-Loup.  Cloud of hydrogen  The Sun interacts with hydrogen atoms through a particular wavelength of ultraviolet light called Lyman-alpha, which the atoms can both absorb and emit. Since this type of light is absorbed by Earth's atmosphere, it can only be observed from space.  Thanks to its hydrogen absorption cell, the SWAN instrument could selectively measure the Lyman-alpha light from the geocorona and discard hydrogen atoms further out in interplanetary space.  The new study revealed that sunlight compresses hydrogen atoms in the geocorona on Earth's dayside, and also produces a region of enhanced density on the night side. The denser dayside region of hydrogen is still rather sparse, with just 70 atoms per cubic centimeter at 60 000 kilometers above Earth's surface, and about 0.2 atoms at the Moon's distance.  ""On Earth we would call it vacuum, so this extra source of hydrogen is not significant enough to facilitate space exploration,"" says Igor.  The good news is that these particles do not pose any threat for space travelers on future crewed missions orbiting the Moon.  ""There is also ultraviolet radiation associated to the geocorona, as the hydrogen atoms scatter sunlight in all directions, but the impact on astronauts in lunar orbit would be negligible compared to the main source of radiation – the Sun,"" says Jean-Loup Bertaux.  On the down side, the Earth's geocorona could interfere with future astronomical observations performed in the vicinity of the Moon.  ""Space telescopes observing the sky in ultraviolet wavelengths to study the chemical composition of stars and galaxies would need to take this into account,"" adds Jean-Loup.  The power of archives  Launched in December 1995, the SOHO space observatory has been studying the Sun, from its deep core to the outer corona and the solar wind, for over two decades. The satellite orbits around the first Lagrange point (L1), some 1.5 million kilometres from Earth towards the Sun.  This location is a good vantage point to observe the geocorona from outside. SOHO's SWAN instrument imaged Earth and its extended atmosphere on three occasions between 1996 and 1998.  Jean-Loup and Igor's research team in Russia decided to retrieve this data set from the archives for further analysis. These unique views of the whole geocorona as seen from SOHO are now shedding new light on Earth's atmosphere.  ""Data archived many years ago can often be exploited for new science,"" says Bernhard Fleck, ESA SOHO project scientist. ""This discovery highlights the value of data collected over 20 years ago and the exceptional performance of SOHO.""

43,43,true/false,"UK economy rebounds despite supply chain woes © Paul ELLIS The lifting of coronavirus curbs to allow more socialising provided Britain's economy with a boost but the recovery still faces headwinds, such as supply chain woes and inflation  Britain's economy rebounded in August despite ongoing supply chain woes, as people socialised more due to the lifting of coronavirus curbs, data showed Wednesday.  Gross domestic product grew 0.4 percent in the first full month since England's lifting of Covid restrictions, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said in a statement.  ""The economy picked up in August as bars, restaurants and festivals benefited from the first full month without Covid-19 restrictions in England,"" noted ONS official Darren Morgan.  ""This was offset by falls in health activity with fewer people visiting GPs and less testing and tracing.""  Construction also fell for the second month in a row, as supply issues created shortages of key materials.  - 'Recovery resumes' -  The ""recovery resumes despite supply chain pressures"", concluded KPMG UK economist Yael Selfin.  ""August GDP ... saw decent growth as the economy bounced back while dealing with supply chain issues and labour shortages.""  The UK economy remains 0.8 percent smaller than its pre-coronavirus level.  All lockdown restrictions in England were lifted on July 19, allowing people to visit shops and hospitality venues without having to wear masks.  Yet the ONS also revealed the economy shrank 0.1 percent in July, revising down an initial estimate of 0.1 percent growth.  That marked the first contraction since January when stricter lockdown curbs weighed on activity.  July was hit by downwardly revised data for the automobile and energy sectors, and improvements to how health output is measured.  Car manufacturing was plagued by an ongoing global shortage of microchips.  Britain's economy had rebounded by 5.5 percent in the second quarter, or three months to June.  But the outlook remains clouded by ongoing Brexit and Covid pandemic fallout and supply chain bottlenecks.  Activity has in addition been hit by shortages of lorry drivers, semiconductors and motor fuel, as well as surging oil and gas prices that have sparked elevated inflation.  The outlook also darkened after the government ended its furlough jobs support scheme and cut back Universal Credit welfare support.  - Recovery facing headwinds -  ""The recovery is certainly facing more headwinds,"" added EY economist Martin Beck.  ""Rising inflation, driven by significant increases in energy prices, and the recent cut in Universal Credit are squeezing consumers' spending power.  ""And continued supply-side disruption and the narrative around shortages, whether real or not, will hold back activity and sentiment.""  Paul Dales, chief UK economist at research consultancy Capital Economics, warned the economy might flatline as a result of supply bottlenecks.  ""Shortages may bite harder in the coming months,"" he added.  ""The recent broadening in shortages and the fuel crisis may mean that growth has come to a near-standstill since August.""  The Bank of England has forecast UK inflation will this year top 4.0 percent on soaring energy costs.  Natural gas prices recently soared to record heights, sparking fears of rocketing domestic fuel bills during the peak-demand winter months.  rfj/cw"
44,44,true/false,"Urban renewal's power: Public investments boost prosperity for all The Chancellor has broken the Conservatives’ manifesto pledge not to raise National Insurance contributions after increasing the headline rate of the tax for some workers in his Budget. Independent white van traders and freelancers are likely to be worst hit by the policy, which will raise the tax rate twice in the next two years ahead of Brexit. The 2015 Conservative election manifesto repeatedly pledged that “we will not raise VAT, National Insurance contributions or Income Tax” . Recommended Six million workers to pay higher National Insurance contributions On another page the document stated that “we can commit to no increases in VAT, Income Tax or National Insurance. Tax rises on working people would harm our economy, reduce living standards and cost jobs”. At the time Labour described the pledge as a “last-minute gimmick”. In the Chancellor’s speech on Wednesday afternoon Mr Hammond however targeted self-employed workers with a hike in the rate of NI contributions. Self-employed workers will see their rate rise from 9 per cent to 10 per cent in 2018, with a further rise to 11 per cent in 2019 ✕ Budget 2017: Seven key points Treasury officials say 2.5 million people will be hit by £240 a year by the NICS class 4 change. The number of people seeing a NICS rise in April 2018 when it comes in will fall to 1.6 million because of the move to abolish class 2 NICS previously announced JIC. He justified the policy on the basis that differences in benefits between employees and self-employed workers “have been very substantially reduced” in recent years.

45,45,true/false,"Answers to Questions About the Texas Abortion Law A Texas law banning most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy went into effect on Wednesday, despite the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right to the procedure, making the state the most restrictive in the nation in terms of access to abortion services.  Other states have passed similar laws, but those measures face legal challenges. The Texas law is the first to be implemented. On a vote of 5 to 4, the court refused just before midnight on Wednesday to block the law.  Because of the way the law was written, it may be difficult to challenge in court, representing a sea change in the battle over abortion rights and inviting imitation by other jurisdictions seeking to tamp down access to abortion.  “These laws are unconstitutional, as we have understood Supreme Court rulings until now, and courts have quickly issued preliminary injunctions blocking enforcement,” said Elizabeth Nash, state policy analyst for the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights."

47,47,true/false,"Coverup on Benghazi does make a difference Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton responds to questioning on the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks in Benghazi, Libya, during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 23, 2013. Credit: Jason Reed / Reuters  By  Fifteen months ago, I asked then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton why she hadn't simply picked up the phone and talked to the Benghazi survivors to find out what had actually happened. Instead of being straightforward, she deflected this uncomfortable question with a now-infamous question of her own: What difference, at this point, does it make?  The answer to that question and the motive behind this administration's lies and coverup are finally becoming quite clear. The belated release of a Sept. 14, 2012, talking points email from deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes proves that senior White House officials were fully engaged in directing the coverup and perpetuating the lies.  According to the Rhodes email, the goal of the administration's Benghazi spin was to underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy. This was in spite of the fact that within hours of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack, the administration knew — or certainly should have known — there was no protest.  So why did the administration lie to America?  Because the truth would have damaged President Barack Obama's re-election chances and further revealed Clinton's dereliction of duty that contributed to the unnecessary deaths of four brave Americans. She fully understood her culpability in the Benghazi tragedy, which is why she reacted so testily to my reasonable line of questioning.  The outrages surrounding the Benghazi attack involve administration action, or lack of action, before, during and after the attack.  The greatest outrages occurred before the attack. The State Department not only failed to honor repeated requests for additional security but instead actually reduced security in Libya. Although no one can say with certainty, I firmly believe a relatively small contingent of armed military guards would have prevented the attack, and those four lives would not have been lost.  The outrageous act of omission during the attack was that no additional defensive or offensive military assets were immediately dispatched to help the endangered personnel in Benghazi. Although it is true that no intervention to save the lives of Ambassador Christopher Stevens or diplomat Sean Smith was possible, I do not believe the same can be said with certainty concerning U.S. personnel Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, who also were killed that night.  No one could know with certainty that the survivors would be able to get to the airport and be safely evacuated within 12 hours. What if they had encountered resistance en route to the airport? There were military assets in Croatia that could have arrived within the 12-hour window it took the survivors to reach safety. Didn't the administration feel obligated to deploy every asset available until the moment the survivors were safe?  Finally, there are the outrageous lies and coverups after the attack. There were many, but I want to concentrate on one: Clinton's comments to Woods' father at the moment she should have been demonstrating only genuine compassion.  Imagine yourself in her role, honoring the remains of four brave Americans who had given their lives for their country. Would you have taken that moment to offer sincere condolences and to grieve with the families? Or would you have seized the opportunity to plant and perpetuate the coverup of your dereliction of duty?  In the words of Woods' father, Clinton did the latter: Hillary Clinton came up to me and I gave her a handshake and a hug, and when I shook her hand, she said to me, 'We are going to have the filmmaker arrested.' Even at that time, she was trying to place a spin on what happened.  What difference does it make? I'll let my fellow Americans judge for themselves.

48,48,true/false,"Fani-Kayode: Those behind Abba Kyari's death rumour are heartless Posted: February 10, 2020 by Last updated: New online scams have preyed on the public's fear about coronavirus outbreak. Don't be fooled. Here is what we know about coronavirus and its related scams. UPDATE 03/05/2020: Yesterday, our malware intelligence researchers found a clever ploy to hide an info-stealer behind a website that purported to show updated coronavirus cases on a global map. Malwarebytes initially detected the malware, which carried the ominous and maybe-too-obvious filename “corona.exe”, as Trojan.Corona. Upon further analysis, we learned that this malware was actually a variant of AzorUlt, a family of spyware that steals information and sometimes downloads additional malware. We have now updated the detection name to Spyware.AzorUlt. Unlike similar coronavirus scams we discovered last month, this threat does not rely on an email campaign. Original story below. Panic and confusion about the recent coronavirus outbreak spurred threat actors to launch several malware campaigns across the world, relying on a tried-and-true method to infect people’s machines: fear. Cybercriminals targeted users in Japan with an Emotet campaign that included malicious Word documents that allegedly contained information about coronavirus prevention. Malware embedded into PDFs, MP4s, and Docx files circulated online, bearing titles that alluded to protection tips. Phishing emails that allegedly came from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were spotted, too. Malwarebytes also found a novel scam purporting to direct users to a donation page to help support government and medical research. All of these threats rely on the same dangerous intersection of misinformation and panic—a classic and grotesque cybercrime tactic. A great defense to these is, quite simply, the truth. At Malwarebytes, we understand that safeguarding you from cyberthreats goes beyond technological protection. It also means giving you the information you need to make smart, safe decisions. Because of this, we’re presenting verified resources and data about coronavirus that will hopefully steer users away from online threats. If you see a sketchy-looking email mentioning the virus (like the one we found below), don’t open it. Instead, come here. If you want to immediately see what these online scams look like, scroll below. What is coronavirus? According to the World Health Organization, the current coronavirus that has infected thousands of people across the world is a single variant of a broader family of viruses, also called “coronavirus.” This particular strain of coronavirus was first identified in the city of Wuhan in central China’s Hubei province. It has the title “2019-nCoV.” Though 2019-nCoV is from the same family of coronaviruses as SARS—which spread to 26 countries between 2002 and 2003—it is not the same virus. As of February 7, coronavirus has spread to at least 25 countries, including Australia, Vietnam, the United States, the Philippines, Nepal, Sweden, the United Kingdom, India, and more. Mexico has no reported cases—the only country in North America to avoid the virus, it appears. Countries in South America, including Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, and Chile, have not reported any confirmed cases of the virus, either. While the majority of infections are reported in China, with 31,211 confirmed cases, the highest count of any other country is Singapore, with 30 cases. Full, daily reports on the virus’ spread can be found at the World Health Organization’s resource page here: Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) situation reports. The situation reports also provide information about every country with confirmed coronavirus cases, and this Al Jazeera article compiles that information up to February 6. According to a February 6 report in The Wall Street Journal that cites scientists and medical academics in China, the recent coronavirus likely started in bats. According to the US Center for Disease Control, coronavirus symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. How can I protect myself from coronavirus? Because coronavirus spreads from human-to-human contact, the best protection methods involve good hygiene. According to the WHO, individuals should: Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand rub if your hands are not visibly dirty. Maintain social distancing—maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and other people, particularly those who are coughing, sneezing and have a fever. Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth. If you have fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Tell your health care provider if you have travelled in an area in China where 2019-nCoV has been reported, or if you have been in close contact with someone with who has travelled from China and has respiratory symptoms. If you have mild respiratory symptoms and no travel history to or within China, carefully practice basic respiratory and hand hygiene and stay home until you are recovered, if possible. The WHO also actively dispelled some current myths about coronavirus. For instance, individuals cannot catch the virus from dogs and cats that are their pets, and vaccines against pneumonia do not protect against coronavirus. For more information on coronavirus myths, please visit the WHO Myth Busters page here, along with the WHO Q&A page. What else should I know about coronavirus? Coronavirus is a serious threat, but it is not the world-ending plague that many fear. As of February 7, the virus has resulted in 637 total deaths. A February 6 notice by the Chinese media service CGTN reported more recoveries, at 1,542. Individuals should not fear receiving packages from China, the WHO said, as the virus cannot survive long durations on physical objects like packages and letters. Similarly, individuals should not dip into unmeasured fear of all things Chinese. These fears have turned New York’s Chinatown district into a “ghost town,” said one local business owner, and have fueled multiple xenophobic and racist assumptions across the world. The WHO says it is okay to receive packages delivered from China. Coronavirus has also received a strong global response. Air travel has been severely limited, Olympic qualifying games were relocated, workers built a hospital in about 10 days, fast food restaurants temporarily closed their locations, and China closed off entire populations—which has come with its own tragic tales of quarantine camps, isolation, and fear. The spread of the virus is scary, yes, but people are working day and night to prevent greater exposure. What should I know about coronavirus scams? Coronavirus online scams are largely similar to one another. By preying on misinformation and fear, cybercriminals hope to trick unwitting individuals into opening files and documents that promise information about the virus. However, Malwarebytes recently found an email scam that preys on people’s desire to help during a moment like this. The scam email—titled “URGENT: Coronavirus, Can we count on your support today?”—purportedly comes from the nondescript “Department of Health.” Inside, the email asks users to donate to coronavirus prevention causes. “We need your support , Would you consider donating 100 HKD to help us achieve our mission?” the email says near its end, before offering a disguised link that opens an application, not a website. The link itself begins with neither HTTPS or HTTP, but “HXXP.” A screenshot of an emailed coronavirus scam that preys on users’ good will. Routine scams that allegedly include information about prevention and protection also come through emails, like this phishing scam spotted by Sophos. A screenshot of the emailed coronavirus scam that Sophos discovered. The malicious email informs its recipient to open an attached document that includes information about “safety measures regarding the spreading of coronavirus,” which then directs users to a page that asks for their email address and password. These scams are becoming a dime a dozen, and we don’t expect them to dwindle any time soon. In fact, threat actors in China were spotted sending malware around through email and through the Chinese social media platform WeChat. Though the exact types of malware were not reported, the Computer Virus Emergency Response Center said the malware itself could be used to steal data or remotely control victims’ devices. Coronavirus information and data resources If you’re afraid about the spread of coronavirus, we understand.

49,49,true/false,"What science can tell us about the links between global warming and massive heat waves The United States is witnessing a massive, dangerous heat wave, as a huge system of high pressure covers the central part of the country. It’s a big enough deal that yesterday President Obama even tweeted about it, including a map showing the maximum heat index in some parts of the Midwest and Southeast reaching 110 or 115 degrees on Saturday. Here in Washington, temperatures could break 100 degrees Friday or over the weekend.   This will, inevitably, lead to much talk of climate change in the coming days. So it’s important to separate the scientific wheat from the chaff and figure out what science can, and can’t, reliably say about the link between an event like this and a warming planet — especially in a year that, on a global scale, has shattered past temperature records for six out of the last six months. And the gist is that when it comes to extreme heat waves in general — heat waves that appear out of the norm in some way, for instance in their intensity, frequency, or duration — while scientists never say individual events are “caused” by climate change, they are getting less and less circumspect about making some connection. “As predictable as the sunrise, some will say heat waves always happened,” said Marshall Shepherd, director of the atmospheric sciences program at the University of Georgia and former president of the American Meteorological Society. “Yep, so did home runs in baseball, but the steroid era brought more and longer home runs. A new National Academies study suggests that ‘heat waves’ may be one of the primary climate change markers like home runs were in baseball.” In other words, when a planet warms, the odds shift in favor of more intense or long lasting heat waves. That’s just plain logic. Indeed, the National Academy of Sciences report in question notes that, “Confidence in attribution findings of anthropogenic influence is greatest for those extreme events that are related to an aspect of temperature, such as the observed long-term warming of the region or global climate, where there is little doubt that human activities have caused an observed change.” “In particular, for extreme heat and cold events, changes in long-term mean conditions provide a basis for expecting that there should also be changes in extreme conditions.” And we’ve definitely already had changes in not only “long-term mean conditions,” but in heat waves themselves. The U.S. National Climate Assessment found that U.S. heat waves have already “become more frequent and intense,” that the U.S. is shattering high temperature records far more frequently than it is shattering low temperature records (just as you’d expect), and that it is seeing correspondingly fewer cold spells. As for future projections, meanwhile, the assessment added that “Climate models project that the same summertime temperatures that ranked among the hottest 5% in 1950-1979 will occur at least 70% of the time by 2035-2064 in the U.S. if global emissions of heat-trapping gases continue to grow.” However, pointing all of this out is not the same as making a specific attribution for this specific heat event — rather, it is saying that attribution can be made for this class or type of event. Beyond that, specific attribution requires active research, and an attention to the actual temperatures, duration and other aspects of the weather phenomenon. That’s because, as Shepherd notes, there are always heat waves, even in a stable climate. Typically, in such an attribution study, scientists will use sets of climate models — one set including the factors that drive human global warming and the other including purely “natural” factors — and see if an event like the one in question is more likely to occur in the first set of models. Researchers are getting better and better at performing these kinds of studies fast, in near real time. So don’t be at all surprised if we see such a study for the current heat wave event — just as we saw for, most recently, the devastating bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, which was tied to an extreme marine heatwave off Australia’s northeastern coast. But in the meantime, some scientists and experts aren’t holding back. With every heat wave, probably the number one question is, is it climate change, or is it not? Well the answer is, it’s both,” said Texas Tech University climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe on a press call Thursday. “We get heat waves naturally, but climate change is amping them up, it’s giving them that extra energy, to make them even more serious, and have even greater impacts.” Hayhoe didn’t attempt a specific attribution of the current heat wave, any more than Shepherd did. Rather, she’s once again articulating the general connection. “We are not used to having heat waves that are extreme as the ones we see today,” she said. It’s important to underscore, as Hayhoe did, that this event poses severe risks to health — particularly for children and the elderly — and also to crops across the U.S. heartland. She pointed to an extreme 2003 heat wave that affected Paris and Europe, and which has indeed been connected to climate change through statistical attribution analysis. That event killed hundreds of people in Paris and London, and a recent study attributed at least some of those deaths, themselves, to climate change. So these links are real, if not always simple to characterize. Now, it’s all about watching this current event carefully, taking preparations, and seeing what scientists have to say once they run their analyses."
50,50,true/false,"Long-Term Monitoring Program Annual Summary Report of Coral Reef Condition 2020/2021 This report summarises the condition of coral reefs of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) from the Long-Term Monitoring Program (LTMP) surveys of 127 reefs conducted between August 2020 and April 2021 (reported as ‘2021’). Over the 35 years of monitoring by AIMS, the reefs of the GBR have shown an ability to recover after disturbances. In 2021, widespread recovery was underway, largely due to increases in fast growing Acropora corals. Survey reefs experienced low levels of acute stressors over the past 12 months with no prolonged high temperatures or major cyclones. Numbers of outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish on survey reefs have generally decreased; however, there remain ongoing outbreaks on some reefs in the Southern GBR. Overall, 59 out of 127 reefs had moderate (>10% - 30%) hard coral cover and 36 reefs had high (>30% - 50%) hard coral cover. On the Northern GBR, region-wide hard coral cover was moderate and had continued to increase to 27% from the most recent low point in 2017. On the Central GBR region-wide hard coral cover was moderate and had increased to 26% in 2021. Region-wide hard coral cover on reefs in the Southern GBR was high and had increased to 39% in 2021. In 2020, most of the surveyed reefs experienced heat stress accumulation that produced widespread coral bleaching but was below thresholds where widespread mortality is expected to occur. Consistent with this, surveys in 2021 recorded low coral mortality from the 2020 bleaching event. In periods free from acute disturbances, most GBR coral reefs demonstrate resilience through the ability to begin recovery. However, the reefs of the GBR continue to be exposed to cumulative stressors, and the prognosis for the future disturbance regime is one of increased and longer lasting marine heatwaves and a greater proportion of severe tropical cyclones. Australian Institute of Marine Science 1.3K subscribers The Great Barrier Reef is in a window of recovery after a decade of disturbances. Watch later Share Watch on Figure 1: Summary of the results from the 127 reefs surveyed by manta tows between August 2020 and April 2021, along with the boundaries of the Northern, Central and Southern GBR reporting regions (see details of the long-term regional coral cover trends further below). a) The status of the surveyed coral reefs is defined by the category of hard coral cover. b) The coral change displays the magnitude and direction of the absolute annual change in reef-level percent hard coral cover between 2021 and the previous survey within the last two years. c) The COTS outbreak status of each reef is defined by the number of COTS per 2-minute manta tow: No COTS (0 COTS), No Outbreak (0 to 0.1 COTS), Potential Outbreak (0.1 to 0.22 COTS), Incipient Outbreak (0.22 to 1 COTS) and Active Outbreak (more than 1 COTS). Reefs are defined as Recovering when they were previously classified with an Incipient or Active Outbreak, but currently have COTS numbers below outbreak thresholds. d) The coral bleaching severity is reported as the percent of live coral colonies bleached at the time of survey per region: Northern GBR (October/November/December 2020), Central GBR (January/February and April 2021) and Southern GBR (August 2020). Background With reef surveys extending over 35 years, the AIMS Long-Term Monitoring Program (LTMP) provides an invaluable record of change by repeatedly surveying coral reef communities over a large area of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). This annual update of the state and trends in hard coral cover across the entire GBR is based on manta tow surveys of coral reefs, mainly on the mid- and outer shelf (Figure 1). A total of 127 reefs were surveyed from August 2020 to April 2021 (reported as ‘2021’). Detailed reports on the state and trends of reefs by latitudinal sectors and of individual reefs, including their disturbance history, and are available shortly after the completion of each survey trip. Data summaries are available for download. The dynamic nature of GBR coral reefs and the considerable variation among regions in the rates of decline and recovery of hard coral cover in response to disturbances are clear in the long-term record. Understanding the dynamics of the disturbance regime provides a critical context for the interpretation of the long-term monitoring data. For annual updates, the GBR Marine Park is divided into three regions (Figure 1), with each showing different trajectories of change in hard coral cover over time, mostly in response to the cumulative impacts of the main disturbances affecting the surveyed reefs, e.g., severe tropical cyclones, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish and coral bleaching. The LTMP provides the longest running, most spatially extensive dataset collected by standard methods on the GBR (see Box 1). Due to logistical and cost constraints, the numbers of reefs surveyed each year are small compared to the number of reefs found on the GBR (~100 vs 3000). However, the LTMP survey reefs provide a representative sample across the length and breadth of the GBR that captures several geographical and ecological gradients (e.g., latitude, position across the continental shelf) and encapsulates many of the bioregions and all the management zones defined in the 2004 rezoning of the Marine Park. AIMS is committed to continual improvement in the analyses of LTMP data, and recent statistical advances have permitted a refinement of analytical approaches used to analyse the type of ecological time series data used in this report. This year we have examined the effectiveness of several approaches and present an ensemble of various statistical models with a justification for the choice of the model selected in this report (see Box 2). Figure 2: Status of the 127 reefs surveyed in the Northern, Central and Southern GBR in 2021. Data are the number of reefs with average hard coral cover falling within low, moderate, high and very high coral cover categories. RESULTS - Condition Summary to April 2021 Northern Great Barrier Reef (Surveyed October to December 2020) There was substantial variation in the condition of individual reefs in the Northern GBR (Figures 1 and 2, Image 1). Seven of 54 reefs surveyed had low coral cover (>0% - 10%), 29 reefs had moderate coral cover (>10% - 30%), 14 reefs had high (>30% - 50%) and four had very high coral cover (>50% - 75%) (Figures 1 and 2). Recovery was underway on the majority of Northern GBR reefs following a period of cumulative disturbances stretching from 2014 to 2020. Of the 32 reefs previously surveyed in the last two years, only six had decreased in hard coral cover (Figure 1), indicating there was minimal mortality from the 2020 mass coral bleaching event at these survey reefs. The impacts of this event are discussed in more detail further below. Region-wide hard coral cover continued to increase from the lowest levels recorded by the LTMP in 2017 to 27% in 2021 (Figure 3). Surveys in 2021 found little evidence of crown-of-thorns starfish activity in the region, most reefs were classified as No COTS and No Outbreak and only one reef classified as Incipient Outbreak (Figure 1). In 2021, surveys were conducted prior to peak summer temperatures. During surveys, 15 of 54 Northern GBR reefs had low-level bleaching (<10% of corals bleached), with no bleaching recorded on the remainder. This indicates there was some accumulation of thermal stress in 2021. Figure 3: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Northern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 129 reefs contributed to the 35-year time series; blue shading represents 95% confidence intervals. 54 reefs were surveyed in 2021. Note that many reefs in this region do not have a regular survey history, and in recent years fewer inshore reefs were surveyed due to the risk of crocodile encounters. Image 1: Photos showing the variable state of reefs in the Northern GBR in 2021. Some reefs had yet to recover from a series of recent disturbances with low hard coral cover and dead standing skeletons covered in turf algae, mostly on mid-shelf reefs such as A. Monsoon Reef and B. Reef 11-049. Other mid-shelf reefs had high numbers of Acropora corals, such as C. Forrester Reef near Cooktown and D. Macgillivray Reef near Lizard Island. Outer shelf coral assemblages had moderate to high levels of hard coral cover such as e) Reef 14-075 and f) Ribbon Reef No. 1.  More information on individual survey reefs can be found here. Central Great Barrier Reef (Surveyed January to April 2021) Since regular surveys by AIMS began in 1985, hard coral cover on reefs in the Central GBR has generally been lower than in the Northern and Southern GBR. Region-wide hard coral cover in the Central GBR decreased to the lowest level in LTMP records in 2012, following the impact of Severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi in 2011 (Figure 4). Hard coral cover then recovered rapidly to the highest average regional cover in the LTMP database record in 2016 (29%). From 2016 to 2019, hard coral cover decreased continuously to 14% (Figure 4), largely due to repeated mass coral bleaching in 2016 and 2017 and outbreaks of crown‐of‐thorns starfish. In 2021, hard coral cover had increased again to 26% (Figure 4). The status of the reefs in the Central GBR was variable in 2021; 32 of the 53 reefs surveyed had low or moderate hard coral cover (<30%) while 21 reefs had coral cover higher than 30% (Figures 1 and 2, Image 2). None of the surveyed reefs had hard coral cover higher than 75% (Figure 2). A total of 30 of the 53 Central GBR reefs surveyed in 2021 had been previously surveyed within the last two years. Hard coral cover had declined on only two reefs while increasing on most of them (28 reefs; Figure 1). Many reefs offshore from Cairns, Innisfail, and Townsville have had outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish in recent years. However, there were no Incipient or Active Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish recorded on Central GBR reefs in 2021 (Figure 1). The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority’s Crown-of-thorns Starfish Control Program has been actively removing substantial numbers of starfish in this area, which would have contributed to the low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish recorded during these surveys. Coral bleaching was widespread in the Central GBR during the last surveys in 2020, although the severity varied among reefs. The impacts of this event are discussed in more detail further below. Central GBR reefs surveyed in 2021 had low-level bleaching (<10% of corals bleached), indicating there was some accumulation of thermal stress. No bleaching levels higher than this were recorded. Figure 4: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Central GBR based on manta tow surveys up. Survey data from 226 reefs contributed to the 35-year time series; blue shading represents 95% confidence intervals. 53 reefs were surveyed in 2021. Image 2: Some Central GBR reefs had very high coral cover like, A. Rebe Reef offshore from the Whitsundays. B. Parts of John Brewer Reef have been protected from crown-of-thorns starfish impacts by the COTS Control Program. C. Numbers of COTS have declined in the Central GBR and very few COTS were recorded in 2021, although some reefs, like D. Rib Reef were badly affected by COTS in previous years and currently have very low coral cover.  More information on individual survey reefs can be found here. Southern Great Barrier Reef (Surveyed August 2020) The Southern GBR has generally had higher coral cover than the Northern or Central GBR, but it has also been the most dynamic over the 35-year survey history. Large declines in hard coral cover followed Severe Tropical Cyclone Hamish in 2009, which reduced coral cover to the lowest levels recorded by the LTMP in 2011 (Figure 5). A large increase in hard coral cover occurred from 2011 to 2016, reaching 37% in 2017. However, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish began in 2018 and regional coral cover decreased to 29% in 2019. In 2021 coral cover has increased again to 39% (Figure 5). The state of individual Southern GBR reefs was variable (Image 3) however, there was a greater proportion of reefs with high coral cover than low or moderate coral cover, a contrast to the Northern and Central GBR where the majority of reefs had coral cover in the two lowest categories (Figures 1 and 2). Of the 20 reefs surveyed in 2021, 19 reefs have been surveyed in the last two years. Hard coral cover decreased on four of these, whereas 15 reefs increased in hard coral cover (Figure 1). In 2016 and 2017, reefs in the Southern GBR were not exposed to the extreme sea surface temperatures that led to the mass coral bleaching on the Central and Northern GBR. However, in the austral summer of 2020, waters of the Southern GBR warmed substantially. Aerial surveys by the ARC Centre of Excellence in Coral Reef Studies revealed widespread severe bleaching across much of the Southern GBR. However, only two reefs accumulated degree-heating weeks[1] (DHW) values in 2020 that were above the level at which mortality would have been expected. The impacts of this event are discussed in more detail further below. In 2021, there was widespread low-level bleaching (<10% of colonies)of sensitive species during surveys, however no instances of more severe bleaching were observed. The Southern GBR was the epicentre of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks in 2021, with three of the 20 reefs classified as having Active Outbreaks and one reef with an Incipient Outbreak (Figure 1). Low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish were recorded on three reefs classified as Recovering or No Outbreak. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority’s Crown-of-thorns Starfish Control Program has been actively removing substantial numbers of starfish in this area. 1Degree Heating Weeks (DHW) shows the accumulated heat stress over the previous three months by adding up the time when temperature exceeds the bleaching threshold. Significant coral bleaching is predicted above 4 DHW and coral mortality is expected above 8 DHW. Further information available from NOAA. Figure 5: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Southern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 137 reefs contributed to the 35-year time series; blue shading represents 95% confidence intervals. 20 reefs were surveyed in 2021. Image 3: Many reefs in the Southern GBR still have high coral cover such as A. Snake Reef in the Swain sector and B. Boult Reef in the Capricorn-Bunkers. However, C. surveys of agents of coral mortality revealed D. outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish continue to decimate coral populations on many reefs in the Swain sector. Such outbreaks leave very low coral cover as seen at E. Chinaman Reef, F. Horseshoe Reef, where crown-of-thorns outbreaks have run their course. More information on individual survey reefs can be found here. Models BOX 2: How the data were analysed The impact of the 2020 mass coral bleaching event In the austral summer of 2020, the Great Barrier Reef was subjected to accumulated heat stress to the level at which mass coral bleaching occurred across much of the GBR. This included the Southern GBR which had escaped bleaching in the 2016 and 2017 events. The third such event in five years is a sign that the Great Barrier Reef is already experiencing the consequences of climate change. Aerial surveys undertaken by the Centre of Excellence in Coral Reef Studies in 2020 revealed extensive mass coral bleaching on the Southern GBR for the first time, as well as widespread bleaching in the Central and Northern GBR. Of the reefs surveyed by the LTMP using manta tow in 2021, 81 were surveyed within the last two years allowing an appraisal of the impacts of the 2020 mass coral bleaching. Only twelve reefs had decreased in hard coral cover. Decreases in coral cover on most of these twelve reefs were most likely associated with heat stress during the 2020 mass bleaching event, as there were few other acute pressures. However, three of these reefs also had crown-of-thorns starfish at densities expected to cause coral mortality and their coral cover declines cannot be attributed solely to coral bleaching. These results indicate minor impacts on coral cover on the LTMP survey reefs from the 2020 mass coral bleaching event. However, it is important to place these results into the context of the accumulated heat stress experienced by survey reefs during the 2020 event, recorded as degree-heating weeks (DHW). Accumulated heat stress was variable across the GBR in 2020 (Figure 6). DHW information was available for 126 out of 127 reefs surveyed in 2021. Of these, 101 reefs experienced heat stress during 2020 that was greater than the threshold at which widespread mass coral bleaching is expected (4 DHW; Figure 6). This agrees with the observations from aerial surveys of widespread bleaching across the Great Barrier Reef. However, only 15 survey reefs experienced heat stress above the levels at which mortality from coral bleaching is expected (8 DHW; Figure 6). This agrees well with the LTMP observations that most reefs surveyed by the LTMP in 2021 appear to have undergone minimal coral mortality following the 2020 bleaching event. Heat stress accumulation between 4 and 8 DHW can cause some mortality but is more likely to produce sub-lethal effects like reduced growth, reproductive output and larval settlement. These sub-lethal effects can have long-lasting impacts on the recovery dynamics of coral reefs; however, the full extent of these impacts is poorly understood and will only become evident in the future. Figure 6: Exposure level of the 127 LTMP reefs surveyed in 2021 to accumulated heat stress during the austral summer of 2020. Widespread bleaching is expected above 4 DHW, while coral mortality is predicted above 8 DHW. Source: NOAA/NESDIS/STAR Coral Reef Watch program The LTMP surveys a representative but small proportion of GBR reefs and there are reefs not surveyed that experienced high levels of accumulated heat stress above thresholds at which we would expect to see coral mortality. This year has seen recovery underway on LTMP survey reefs across much of the GBR. However, the metric hard coral cover, while being a simple and robust measure of reef condition, reveals nothing about the diversity or composition of coral assemblages. To assess this, the LTMP also quantifies the percent cover of different coral types using digital imagery along permanently marked transects during fixed site surveys, at a smaller subset of reefs across the length and breadth of the GBR. The majority of recovery was driven by increases in the fast-growing Acropora corals, which have proliferated across many GBR reefs. Once established, these corals enter an exponential growth phase which rapidly increases measures of percent hard coral cover, as documented in this year’s results. However, the fast growth comes at a cost, the skeleton is less dense than other slower growing corals, making them particularly susceptible to wave damage, like that generated by strong winds and tropical cyclones. They are also highly susceptible to coral bleaching and are the preferred prey for crown-of-thorns starfish. This means that large increases in hard coral cover can quickly be negated by disturbances on reefs where Acropora predominate. Preliminary analyses have also revealed a shift in the community composition of coral assemblages on some outer shelf reefs in the Northern and Central GBR, where the impacts of the 2016 and 2017 bleaching were greatest. While there have been increases in hard coral cover in these areas, there has been a shift to coral assemblages dominated by Pocillopora corals (Image 4) rather than the typically dominant Acropora corals. This shift to Pocillopora-dominated reefs likely results from different mechanisms on different reefs and may include: Adult Pocillopora have survived bleaching where other corals have died, and, Surviving Pocillopora can produce more offspring after bleaching as they are more numerous and spawn more frequently than other corals like Acropora Image 4: Coral community changes at Yonge Reef in the Northern region of the GBR from A. 2001 when Acropora corals were abundant to B. 2021 when Pocillopora corals were emerging as the dominant coral species. The replacement of Acropora corals by Pocillopora has important ramifications. For example, slower growth of Pocillopora will likely result in decreased speed of recovery. Additionally, impacts to other animals, like fishes, which are dependent on Acropora corals for food and shelter, may become apparent due to the reduced habitat complexity of a Pocillopora-dominated reef. AIMS will continue to monitor these reefs to determine whether Pocillopora continues to dominate, how that will affect other parts of the reef ecosystem, as well as conduct more detailed analyses of the longer-term effects of bleaching and other disturbances on the trajectory of coral reef status. Assessing the long-term health of the Great Barrier Reef Determining the status of the GBR requires robust long-term datasets collected using standard methods. Long-term data are particularly important to avoid the “shifting baseline” syndrome, as the results each year are always considered in the context of the long-term trends. The last couple of years have revealed that recovery is underway across much of the GBR, a promising sign illustrating that the GBR still has the capacity and necessary ecological functions to recover from disturbances. The Central and Southern GBR had periods of recovery within the last decade which have been curtailed by disturbances, arresting recovery, and causing further coral declines. Sustained recovery of the GBR back to historical high coral cover requires the next few years to be disturbance free to allow corals to continue to grow and increase their populations. While there have been hard coral cover increases across all three regions over recent years, the Northern and Southern GBR are still below the highest recorded coral cover in the 1980s, and preliminary analyses have documented shifts in the dominant corals on some reefs. 2021 has been a low disturbance year, while the period from 2014 to 2020 was an intense period of widespread disturbances. There were numerous severe tropical cyclones and three mass coral bleaching events in five years. The fourth wave of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks began around 2010 between Lizard Island and Cairns, and by 2020 had progressed south to reefs offshore from Townsville. The prognosis for the future disturbance regime under climate change is one of increasingly frequent and longer lasting marine heatwaves and a greater proportion of severe tropical cyclones. Mitigation of these climatic threats requires immediate global action on climate change. Crown-of-thorns starfish as coral predators are a major cyclic disturbance on the GBR and when left unchecked, outbreaks can decimate coral populations. However, it is one of the few threats to the GBR that can be directly managed locally. The Crown-of-thorns Control Program has been active on the GBR during the current outbreak and seeks to reduce starfish numbers at key reefs to reduce the amount of coral lost and to diminish the brood stock which propagates the outbreak ‘wave’ southward through most of the GBR. In 2021, the number of Active Outbreaks has decreased from previous years, although outbreaks were still recorded in the Swain sector of the Southern GBR. The LTMP aims to assist analyses of the effectiveness of the Crown-of-thorns Control Program in the next few years. The predicted consequences of climate change, which include more frequent and intense mass coral bleaching events, are now a contemporary reality. Simultaneously, chronic stressors such as high turbidity, increasing ocean temperatures and changing ocean chemistry can all negatively affect recovery rates, while more frequent acute disturbances mean that the intervals for recovery are becoming shorter. Measuring and understanding the process of, and limitations to, coral reef recovery will be a continued focus of AIMS’ research and monitoring over the next years."

National Records of Scotland figures show the underlying cause of the deaths has been adverse effects of Covid-19 vaccines.  This is in the context of 2.81 million people having been given at least one dose by April 30, according to statistics from Public Health Scotland.  The statistics also showed Scotland recorded six coronavirus deaths between May 10 and May 16, a drop of one on the previous week.  One death was of someone aged 75 or over and the other five deaths were of people aged under 65.  It means 10,109 deaths have been registered in Scotland where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate.  North Lanarkshire recorded three coronavirus-related deaths, Glasgow recorded two deaths, while Perth and Kinross recorded one death.  Four deaths occurred in hospitals, one death occurred in a care home, and one in a non-institutional setting such as at home.  There were 32 excess deaths in the previous week, representing 3% above the five-year average for this week."

EAST ANTARCTIC ICE SHEET  This is the last of three dispatches from a New York Times reporting trip to Antarctica.  From the air, the Ross Ice Shelf looks like a vast white plain extending to the horizon. The monochromatic landscape is relieved only occasionally by rocks poking through, or by deep crevasses in the ice itself.  Only at its edge does the ice shelf become something more dramatic: a spectacular sheer cliff rising 100 feet above the ocean and extending 900 feet below the surface. From that cliff edge, icebergs occasionally calve away, completing a thousand-year journey of the ice from land to sea.  Scientists are racing to understand what is happening to the Ross Ice Shelf — and the rest of Antarctica — as the planet warms around it. They are trying to map the thickness of the ice and the shape of the sea floor beneath it in an effort to gauge how vulnerable the shelf may be to collapse, and how soon that could happen.  Scientists are also trying to measure the role of human-caused climate change in weakening some parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet, and to fathom how damaging the seas around the continent might prove to be as they warm over time.  The edge of the Ross Ice Shelf.  The answers carry profound implications for humanity. In the scientists’ worst-case computer simulations, continued global warming will cause the Ross Ice Shelf to weaken and collapse starting as early as the middle of this century.  Right now, the shelf works like a giant bottle-stopper that slows down ice trying to flow from the land into the sea. If it collapses, the ice could flow into the ocean more rapidly, an effect that has already happened on a much smaller scale in other areas of Antarctica.  The most vulnerable parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet could raise the sea level by 10 to 15 feet, inundating many of the world’s coastal cities, though most scientists think that would take well over a century, or perhaps longer. They are worried about a possible rise of as much as six feet by the end of this century.  Whether these alarming forecasts ultimately prove right depends in part on the shape of the sea floor beneath the ice shelf, and in particular on whether it has deep channels that can funnel warming ocean water under the ice shelf and attack the West Antarctic ice sheet from below. A different undersea topography — high ridges of rock, for example — may keep warmer water out, stabilizing the ice sheet, possibly for hundreds of years.  “We’re hoping to figure out how warm water can get to the edge of the ice sheet,” said Robin E. Bell, head of the Columbia University laboratory that sent a team to survey the Ross Ice Shelf late last year. “What are the sort of hidden roads it can go on?”  As they flew back and forth across the vast white landscape in December, the Columbia scientists used some of the world’s most sophisticated geophysical instruments to see into and beneath the ice. As the hours-long flights wore on, the scientists took turns napping, knitting or eating cold pizza, but at all times, somebody kept close watch on the instruments.  Kirsty J. Tinto, the scientist leading the field team, loved watching as the measurements stripped away the illusion that the ice was just a flat, boring pancake.  “You take a slice through it and you can see a thousand years of history, a hundred million years of history,” she said.  Kirsty J. Tinto steps out of an LC-130 Hercules on the Ross Ice Shelf.  The Ross Ice Shelf appears stable now, so the Columbia project will function somewhat like a doctor’s baseline X-ray — a starting point for comparison if the ice starts to deteriorate.  Satellite evidence suggests that this is already happening in other parts of West Antarctica, and many scientists believe that relatively warm ocean water is the culprit. “It’s kind of a blowtorch on the underside of the ice shelf,” said Robert A. Bindschadler, a retired NASA climate scientist.  But the story is not straightforward, and the warmer water attacking the ice has not been linked to global warming — at least not directly. The winds around the continent seem to be strengthening, stirring the ocean and bringing up a layer of warmer water that has most likely been there for centuries.  Are those stronger winds tied to human-caused global warming? Some scientists think so, but others say the case is unproven. “We’re not sure because we don’t have enough data, for long enough, to separate signal from noise,” said Eric J. Steig, a scientist at the University of Washington who has studied temperature trends in Antarctica.  Though the role of global warming is unclear now, it is likely to be a factor in the relatively near future. Many experts think warmer air temperatures could start to weaken the ice of West Antarctica from above, even as warmer ocean water attacks it from below.  The warmer water seems to be doing the most damage to a series of glaciers that flow into a region of West Antarctica called the Amundsen Sea. Satellites have identified the most rapid loss of ice there, raising a critical question: Has an unstoppable collapse of the ice sheet already begun?  Ross Ice Shelf Pine Island Glacier Thwaites Glacier Ross Sea Amundsen Sea Pine Island Glacier Thwaites Glacier Amundsen Sea Red areas have lost significant amounts of ice since 2010.  The Amundsen Sea region is one of the remotest parts of the continent, far from American and British research bases. Working together, the two countries are planning to devote tens of millions of dollars to getting better measurements there, having decided that it is imperative to begin answering questions about the region’s potential collapse.  For instance, scientists need to know a lot more about the ground beneath the glaciers there. Is it slick mud that may allow the ice to flow much faster, or hard rock that may slow down the ice even in a warmer world?  “What we need to know is really the details of what is occurring where the ice, ocean and land all come together,” said Ted A. Scambos, a University of Colorado scientist who is helping to plan the joint research effort.  Unraveling the answers, and gaining a better understanding of how Antarctica’s ice has waxed and waned in the past, may offer a rough guide to the changes that human-caused global warming could wreak in the future.  Already, scientists know enough to be concerned. About 120,000 years ago, before the last ice age, the planet went through a natural warm period, with temperatures similar to those expected in coming decades.  The sea level was 20 to 30 feet higher than it is today, implying that the ice sheets in both Greenland and Antarctica must have partly disintegrated, a warning of what could occur in the relatively near future if the heating of the planet continues unchecked.  But some research suggests that a catastrophe might not yet be inevitable. In a study last year, Robert M. DeConto of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and David Pollard of Pennsylvania State University used their computer model to predict what would happen if emissions were reduced sharply over the next few decades, in line with international climate goals.  Under the most ambitious scenarios, they found a strong likelihood that Antarctica would remain fairly stable.  “There’s still a chance that all hell will break loose,” Dr. DeConto said. “But the model is suggesting there’s a way to reduce the risk of a big sea-level rise from Antarctica.”"
53,53,true/false,"Brexit: Number of Britons getting EU citizenship of another country doubles The number of Britons taking up EU citizenship of another member state more than doubled in the year of the Brexit referendum, official EU figures show.  Eurostat, the EU’s statistics agency, shows that 6,555 British nationals acquired such citizenship in 2016, up from 2,478 in 2015.  Germany was the biggest country for Britons to adopt the citizenship of, with 2,702. France and Belgium followed with 517 and 506 citizens each.  Other​ significant beneficiaries of British citizens were Cyprus, Ireland and Italy.  “We are seeing a Brexodus of people giving up their passports and rushing to take citizenship in EU countries as Brexit draws near,” Paul Butters, a spokesperson for the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign, said.  “People have done this to give themselves some security. This should make David Davis ashamed that people feel they have no option but to give up their citizenship or apply to be a dual national. These people are giving up part of their identity to try to secure their future.  “The government don’t seem to care and their only interest is their ill advised ‘tens of thousands’ immigration target.  “The government dragged their feet over EU citizens’ rights and this is the real life manifestation of their tactics.

British citizens will lose the automatic rights to work and settle in other EU countries after Brexit, making UK passports less powerful. The government has, however, said British passports will be changed to blue, which Brexiteers claimed could not be the case while the UK was still in the bloc.  The EU referendum was held on 23 June 2016 meaning that any acceleration of applications for citizenship after the referendum would only have applied in the second half of the year.

One possible post-Brexit immigration scheme could struggle to channel workers towards less attractive roles - while another may heighten the risk of labour exploitation, a new report warns. PA The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Customs union A key point in the negotiations remains Britain's access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does? No 10 has so far insisted that “Brexit means Brexit” and that Britain will be leaving the customs union, but may be inclined to change its position once the potential risks to the UK’s economic outlook become clearer. Alamy The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Northern Ireland-Irish border Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. To ensure borderless travel on the island, the countries must be in regulatory alignment and therefore adhere to the same rules as the customs union. In December, the Conservative Party’s coalition partners, the DUP, refused a draft agreement that would place the UK/EU border in the Irish Sea due to its potential to undermine the union. May has promised that would not be the case and has suggested that a “specific solution” would need to be found. Getty The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Transition period Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit. The talks, however, have reached an impasse. Though May has agreed that the UK will continue to contribute to the EU budget until 2021, the PM wants to be able to select which laws made during this time the UK will have to adhere to. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said the UK must adopt all of the laws passed during the transition, without any input from British ministers or MEPs. EPA The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Rights of EU citizens living the UK The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear. May insists that those who arrive during the transition period should not be allowed to stay, whereas the EU believe the cut-off point should be later. Getty The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Future trade agreement with the EU Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU. Infighting within the Cabinet has prevented a solid position from being reached, with some MPs content that no deal is better than a bad deal while others rally behind single market access. The EU has already confirmed that access to the single market would be impossible without the UK remaining in the customs union. Getty The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Future trade agreements internationally The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London. However the UK cannot make trade agreements with another country while it is still a member of the EU, and the potential loss of trade with the world's major powers is a source of anxiety for the PM. The EU has said the UK cannot secure trade deals during the transition period. EPA The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Financial services Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal. However according to new reports Germany has suggested allowing trade on the condition that the UK continues paying into the EU budget even after the transition period. Getty  Ireland’s Department of Foreign Affairs said in late 2017 that more than a fifth of all Irish passports issued in the last year went to people living in the UK.  The department in Dublin said more than 779,000 of the Republic’s passports were issued in 2017, a record figure, with 81,752 Irish citizens in Northern Ireland being among those who received passports.  The European parliament has repeatedly called in its resolutions for exploration of some mechanism by which British people can opt-in to keep their EU citizenship, but little actual movement has been made on this so far in talks – with such a system looking increasingly unlikely."
54,54,true/false,"The Gingrich Tragedy - The New York Times Then Romney put his boys on notice: He would be making predetermined stops for gas, and that was it. Before beginning the drive, Mitt Romney put Seamus, the family's hulking Irish setter, in a dog carrier and attached it to the station wagon's roof rack. He'd built a windshield for the carrier, to make the ride more comfortable for the dog. His father had known poverty as a child, Mitt only privilege. His father had succeeded without a college degree while Mitt was launched with the finest educational pedigree. Given all his advantages, Mitt seemed restless to make his mark sooner. If anything, 36-year-old Mitt, who had just been tapped to lead a new venture capital firm, was on track to achieve more at a younger age than his famously overachieving father. Even for someone who had always idolized his father, the similarities between his path in life and the one George Romney had cut before him were remarkable. Husband to his high school sweetheart , father to a brood of young children , bishop of his local Mormon church, and businessman on the threshold of life-altering success. As with most ventures in his life, he had left little to chance, mapping out the route and planning each stop. The destination for this journey in the summer of 1983 was his parents' cottage on the Canadian shores of Lake Huron. Romney would be returning to the place of his most cherished childhood memories. The white Chevy station wagon with the wood paneling was overstuffed with suitcases, supplies, and sons when Mitt Romney climbed behind the wheel to begin the annual 12-hour family trek from Boston to Ontario. Ann's roommate at BYU was Cindy Burton, a Michigan friend who would go on to marry Ann's older brother. Now Cindy Davies, she says that for a time she thought Ann might end up marrying Cameron. So it was in the fall of 1968, just months after he had survived a horrific car crash, that Romney received the letter he had been dreading. It wasn't the classic breakup letter, but it was close. Ann wrote that she hadn't had feelings for any of the BYU men pursuing her, until this one fellow named Kim Cameron, a basketball player and vice president of the student government. He reminded her, she wrote, of Mitt. Ann, meanwhile, was living the life of a co-ed at Brigham Young University. The Provo, Utah, campus was flush with men who had just returned from their own missions, with sharpened skills of persuasion and a determination to find a wife made more urgent by the Mormon ban on premarital sex. Not for nothing was the place nicknamed B-Y-Woo. But the 2 1/2-year mission took its toll on the romance. Under the rigid rules for missionaries, Romney was forbidden from telephoning Ann more than a couple of times a year, and his two visits with her were brief and supervised. Ann Davies had said yes to his informal marriage proposal when she was just 16. After Romney went to France, his father personally baptized her a Mormon. Staring at the wall, Romney worried, ''Is this what's in store for me?'' Back in 1967, when Romney was moving into a Paris apartment with fellow Mormon missionaries at 126 Rue du Chateau, his eyes were immediately drawn to a wall covered with hand-written letters. They were all ''Dear John'' break-up notes that other missionaries had received from their girlfriends back home. He had always treated Ann that way, especially since he'd nearly lost her. Tagg didn't get it back then, but now at age 37 he finally understands why his father has been willing to suspend his regimented ways when it comes to his wife. ''When they were dating,'' Tagg says, ''he felt like she was way better than him, and he was really lucky to have this catch. He really genuinely still feels that way, thinks, 'I'm so lucky I've got her.' So he puts her on a pedestal.'' ''Think about it,'' Tagg says, ''a 12-hour drive and the only time we stop is to get gas. When we stop, you can buy your food and go to the bathroom, but that's the only time we're stopping, so you'd better get it all done at once.'' Yet there was one exception to Mitt's nonstop policy. ''As soon as my mom says, 'I think I need to go to the bathroom,' he pulls over instantly, and doesn't complain. 'Anything for you, Ann.'.'' The church was at the center of the family's spiritual and social lives. Before high school every day, the boys went to a neighbor's house for ''seminary,'' where they would discuss scripture for 45 minutes. Sunday mornings were spent in church, and Sunday afternoons were devoted to volunteer work. Tuesday evening ''mutual'' brought together church families for basketball games and cookouts. While moving ahead briskly in the business world, Mitt took on the added responsibility of serving as a lay bishop of Belmont's Mormon congregation. ''Mitt,'' says Kem Gardner, a fellow church official from this period, ''just had the capacity to keep all the balls up in the air.'' Mitt and Ann moved east in 1971 so he could attend graduate school at Harvard. They settled in Belmont and began expanding their family. In 1981, Ann delivered their fifth and final son. By then, they had moved from a modest three-bedroom place to a handsome four-bedroom, natural shingle house near the private Belmont Hill School, which all five boys would attend. The next morning, the wedding party and guests flew to Salt Lake City and in the spired Mormon temple, Mitt and Ann were ''sealed'' for eternity. Because they were not Mormons, Ann's parents were not allowed inside. Mitt and Ann agreed to wait three months to walk down the aisle. The wedding was held in two parts. On March 21, 1969, exactly four years after their first conversation, Mitt, then 22, and Ann, 19, exchanged rings in a civil ceremony in her parents' home. It was officiated by church Elder Edwin Jones, the man after whom teenage Mitt had patterned his hairstyle. When they made it home, he told his parents about their plans for an immediate wedding. His father was delighted. His mother was horrified. A pillar of Detroit society, Lenore Romney knew a wedding was not something to be rushed. But that was only part of her hesitation. ''I think Lenore had a hard time letting go of her youngest son,'' Cindy Davies says, stressing Lenore's special connection to the baby her doctors had said she could never have. While George had quickly forged a loving bond with Ann, it took longer for Lenore. ''Her relationship with Ann wasn't as warm. She held back more.'' ''You want to get married?'' he asked. ''I feel exactly the same way,'' she said. ''Gosh, this feels like I've never been gone,'' he recalls telling her. ''I can't believe it.'' Ann joined the Romney clan in meeting him at the airport. Showered with hugs from his family, Mitt kept his focus squarely on Ann. Sitting with her in the third-row seat of his sister's Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser, he wasted little time. As he flew home just before Christmas 1968, Romney worried about what awaited him and Ann. ''I didn't know how we would feel.'' Romney feared the same. In letters to Ann, he implored her to wait for him. ''I think that's probably right,'' Cameron says now. ''Emotionally, I felt very close to her.'' A few years later, Ann would be mocked for her public claim that she and Mitt had never had an argument, which sounded preposterous to the ears of many married mortals. But Tagg says it's not that his parents never disagree. ''I know there are things that she says that he doesn't agree with sometimes, and I see him kind of bite his tongue. But I know that they go and discuss it in private. He doesn't ever contradict my mother in public.'' After a few years, the tensions lifted, as Mitt learned to give Tagg more space, and Tagg began to regret how he'd been behaving. By the time he was 15, the arguments stopped, and Tagg was once again looking at his father and seeing his hero. Tagg's early-adolescent struggles were emotional in nature, which meant they played more to his mother's strengths than his father's. With a few exceptions, ''he's not emotional at all,'' Tagg says. ''She runs on emotion, he runs on logic.'' Tagg had no problem with his mother, ''but my dad and I would just go at it.'' Family members say Mitt had a tough time dealing with this rejection from his oldest son. After all, Mitt's relationship with his own father had never suffered such strain. ''Overnight,'' Tagg says, ''everything about him bugged me.'' The way he wore his jeans so short. The way he insisted all the boys wake up early on Saturdays for chores. Even the way he said good morning. ''It bothered me that he would be so nice about it.'' As Mitt had before him, Tagg spent his early years idolizing his father. But then he spent much of his adolescence wanting nothing to do with his dad. It began around age 11, when his father in his eyes went from ''superman to supernerd.'' In time, the five boys would take on their own profiles within the family. As Tagg would later describe his brothers, Matt was ''the jokester, always pushing people's buttons'' and Josh was ''the typical middle child, wanting lots of attention and getting a lot of it.'' Ben remained ''very reserved and quiet, a little aloof from the situation'' while Craig relished his role as ''the ultimate baby, everyone's favorite brother.'' Tagg says he himself was the typical oldest brother, ''Type A and too tightly wound.'' At night, the family had a tradition of holding a freewheeling discussion while sitting together in a room, with the lights turned off. The practice was an outgrowth of the boys' habit of wandering into their parents' room in the middle of the night, climbing onto the couch at the foot of their bed, and wanting to talk. Over time, the discussion drifted to the evening hours before bed, with the darkened room somehow allowing the boys to feel more free to open up. ''It was just a time to totally be yourself,'' Tagg says. Later that summer, Ann and Mitt, according to the story they both would tell, were lying in bed when she turned to him. With her father's advice about making the most of life still echoing in her head, she told Mitt, ''You've got to run against Ted Kennedy.'' He laughed and pulled the covers over his head. In June 1993, as her condition worsened, Ann's mother asked her sons, Rod and Jim Davies, to baptize her a Mormon, according to both sons. Five days after her baptism, she died. In late summer 1992, Ann's father's condition quickly deteriorated. He remained opposed to organized religion, even though all three of his children, thanks largely to their association with Mitt Romney, had built their lives around the Mormon Church. As he bid his life goodbye, he urged his only daughter to make the most of hers. Not long after settling into their new house, Ann and Mitt invited her parents to move in to their guest suite above a bank of garages. Ann's father was battling prostate cancer, her mother ovarian cancer, and Ann nursed them through their treatments at Massachusetts General Hospital. In 1990, Romney began a turnaround effort at Bain & Company, the much larger -- but fast sinking -- sister company to Bain Capital. A few years later, he was back full time at his old firm. It had been reorganized as Bain Capital Inc., with Romney as CEO and sole owner. And it had matured, meaning far bigger paychecks were on their way. Before long, his father could have afforded to buy up the whole street, as he built a fortune that two of his former partners now estimate to be more than $400 million. Then, in 1989, Mitt and Ann allowed their first bout of conspicuous spending, plunking down $1.25 million for a stately five-bedroom house up the road, enlarging and renovating it, plus installing a pool and tennis court. At the time, Tagg was in France, following in his father's footsteps as a Mormon missionary. After his parents sent him a photo of their new place, he asked his father, ''How can you afford that house?'' His sons urged him to buy a luxury car, but he refused. Still, they had no idea how much money he had. Yet Mitt eschewed the trappings of wealth. The family had no cook or full-time maid. And Mitt continued to drive a dented Chevy Caprice Classic nicknamed ''the gray grunt.'' As the 1980s wore on, Mitt's responsibilities grew both at work and in the church, where he was promoted to stake president, overseeing about a dozen congregations. And his Midas touch at Bain Capital was helping to make him rich. In that way, the relationship between Mitt and Ann differed from the one between Mitt's parents. Despite their lifetime of devotion, George and Lenore had no problem airing their disagreements, especially in later years, according to Tagg. ''Listen, they fought like cats and dogs. We called them 'The Bickersons.'.'' It was the year Newt Gingrich was pushing his Contract with America, but Romney distanced himself from Gingrich and rejected help from the national right-wing apparatus. Romney stressed his own family values to create a contrast with Kennedy, who had a past reputation for womanizing. One commercial showed Mitt and Ann on their porch with glasses of lemonade. Asked to name his greatest personal failing, Romney lamented that he only had time to help the needy one day a week. He supported the assault weapons ban and the Brady gun control law. He favored indexing the minimum wage to inflation. In a letter to an organization of gay Republicans, he claimed he would be a stronger advocate for their rights than Kennedy. He demanded work for welfare recipients and talked tough on immigration, mandatory drug sentencing, and the death penalty. And, running in a state where the GOP's limited success had come mostly from fiscally conservative, socially liberal candidates, Romney staked out moderate positions on some issues. Despite Kennedy's baggage, Romney's team ruled out a character assault. Instead, Romney attacked Kennedy and his ''big-government'' policies as both being overdue for retirement. In October 1993, Romney changed his party affiliation from independent to Republican and began raising money. In February 1994, before a crowd of about 200 at the Copley Plaza, he formally announced his candidacy. Political operatives told Romney that Kennedy was never more vulnerable. ''People said to me, 'You know, he's getting older, he's over the hill. He's not coherent any more,'.'' Romney recalls. ''I was getting ready for this guy that was going to be kind of a doddering old fool. I'd be able to crush him like a grape.'' But Romney had timing on his side. An anti-Democratic storm was building nationwide. And the youngest Kennedy brother was a tarnished icon, even to Catholic voters raised in homes with brittle palm fronds wedged behind pictures of John F. Kennedy. The shocking revelations about the senior senator that emerged during the 1991 Palm Beach rape trial of his nephew remained fresh in many voters' minds. For a man who had succeeded in business largely by using rigorous analysis and fastidious preparation to reduce his margin of error, a run against Kennedy would be quite a roll of the dice. In 32 years, no Republican had come close to dislodging Kennedy, the embodiment of Democratic liberalism. Mitt had been contemplating a move into politics for some time. At age 55, his father had used his success as a business turnaround artist to launch his second act of politics. Now Mitt, who had already established his own turnaround credentials, was looking to follow the same script, except a decade ahead of his father's schedule. Romney held a news conference to criticize Kennedy for violating his own brother's edict to separate religion and politics, which in 1960 helped John Kennedy become the nation's first Catholic president. Kennedy's campaign said Romney should be asked about the Mormon Church's past policy of excluding blacks from the priesthood. But the Kennedy machinery, rusty at the start, was cranking up. So was the senator. Mitt's own race in 1994 got off to a good start. After he easily won the Republican primary , polls showed Romney to be even with or even slightly ahead of Kennedy. In the end, Hart handed out more than flowers, drubbing Lenore and giving her sons two important lessons about politics, according to Scott. ''You need to define yourself, and not let others define you. And it's no fun to lose.'' They resented how Hart tried to paint Lenore as a nice woman whose place was in the home, not the Senate. ''At the start of every debate, he would come over and hand her a rose,'' Scott recalls. Lenore Romney ran for US Senate in 1970 against popular Democratic incumbent Philip Hart. Taking a break from college to help out, 23-year-old Mitt turned to his older brother, Scott, and said, ''Gee, you and I ought to be running this campaign.'' Mitt had always been more careful and wary than his father, according to family members, and, in that way, more like his mother. In fact, his race against Kennedy had stronger parallels to his mother's single run for office than any of his father's campaigns. Despite the similarities between father and son in appearance and career path, the race highlighted the differences in their makeup. Behind the scenes, George - whose unguarded nature had hastened his downfall in the 1968 presidential campaign - admonished Mitt to loosen up, stop listening to consultants, and trust his gut. On the trail and on the fund-raising circuit, the vigorous 86-year-old was a celebrity stand-in for his son, relishing his return to the podium. Years later, Mitt Romney would recall watching the cameras shift away from him and onto his irrepressible father during press conferences, as George shook his fist and spoke his mind. Before long, George and Lenore moved into the guest suite above Mitt and Ann's garage, and George wasted no time in tutoring his son in politics. During the campaign kickoff, George Romney introduced his son, signaling the active role the former Michigan governor would play in the race and the reemergence of the father-son dynamic that had defined Mitt Romney's early life. He was more welcoming of help from his family. ''I don't want their money. I don't want their help,'' Romney said. ''This is my race.'' Still, Romney remained within striking distance, down 44 percent to Kennedy's 49 percent in a Globe poll in early October. Then came the first televised debate . Romney was on leave as Bain Capital's chief executive when the cuts occurred, but he struggled to rebut the charge. His polls numbers began to drop, with more voters describing him as a cold-hearted businessman. About a month before the election, Kennedy launched his most devastating attack. On the airwaves, he strafed Romney with tough ads designed to turn his greatest asset of business success into a vulnerability. Romney's Bain Capital had bought a paper company called American Pad & Paper, or Ampad , which then bought an Indiana plant and laid off workers, cut wages, and reduced benefits. The workers began striking. Seizing on Romney's candidacy, they brought their complaints to Massachusetts. Romney accepted the endorsement of Massachusetts Citizens for Life, though his aides labored to blur the distinctions with Kennedy, who years earlier had dropped his opposition to abortion and become a leader on abortion rights. Asked at the time how the two candidates differed on abortion, Romney's political consultant Charles Manning said, ''It's tiny nuances.'' Women's groups and political foes voiced skepticism over Romney's support of abortion rights. Although he said that as a politician he would not force his beliefs on others, Romney acknowledged that as a church leader, he had counseled women against having abortions. The Globe reported that as a Mormon bishop Romney had urged a mother of five, whose pelvic blood clot made her pregnancy dangerous, not to have an abortion. But there had been some wavering. Early in the campaign, he said he opposed Medicaid funding for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest, or threat to the mother's life. Later in the campaign, he said he would leave that matter up to the states. ''My mother and my family have been committed to the belief that we can believe as we want, but we will not force our beliefs on others on that matter,'' Romney declared. ''And you will not see me wavering on that.'' Although he always said he was personally opposed to abortion, Romney sought to reassure Massachusetts voters of his pro-choice bona fides by citing his mother's example. Lenore had run for the Senate on an abortion-rights platform, a stance forged by the death of her son-in-law's teenage sister from an illegal abortion. The Kennedy camp also hammered Romney on abortion, asserting that he had a secret pro-life agenda. But it was George Romney who stole the show that day. Surprising even his son, he stepped forward and thundered, ''I think it is absolutely wrong to keep hammering on the religious issues. And what Ted is trying to do is bring it into the picture.'' In 1997, Ann Romney felt numbness in her right leg. Then it spread to her entire right side. She had trouble getting up the stairs. Over the next year, she began having some difficulty swallowing, needing more sleep than usual, and feeling nauseated for a good part of every day. After the loss, Mitt told his brother, ''I never want to run for something again unless I can win.'' An unfailing optimist, George had never wallowed in his own failed campaign, and he didn't dwell on his son's either. Still, for Mitt, there was no denying that his idol's last image of him was one associated with failure. With Mitt back at Bain, his parents returned to Michigan. A year later, George Romney collapsed while running on his treadmill. He died at age 88. ''I'm sure I ruffled a lot of feathers,'' Romney recalled in his autobiography ''Turnaround.'' ''I had been gone for a year, and they were getting along fine without me. But Bain Capital was my baby and I was back in town. I owned 100 percent of the voting stock.'' After a year spent surrendering control to others - consultants, voters, even his father - Romney wasted no time in returning to his more comfortable position of being in charge. The morning after the election, he held a meeting at Bain Capital, and immediately started handing out assignments and reviewing deals. On election day, as Gingrich helped the GOP capture both houses of Congress for the first time in nearly half a century, Kennedy crushed Romney , 58 percent to 41 percent. By the end of the campaign, Romney began to heed his father's advice and loosen up. But it wasn't enough. Mitt Romney, like his mother a quarter-century earlier, had allowed his opponent to define him. When Romney charged that Kennedy had benefited from a no-bid real estate deal, the senior senator thundered back with the full weight of his family's history behind him. ''Mr. Romney, the Kennedys are not in public service to make money,'' he said, delivering a rehearsed line to wild applause. ''We have paid too high a price in our commitment to the public service of this country.'' Kennedy laid into Romney on Ampad . ''I don't know why you wouldn't meet with the strikers with that flimflam deal of yours out there in Indiana,'' he snorted. Expectations were low for Kennedy, seen as past his prime, and high for Romney, the telegenic upstart. But with his booming voice and fiery tone, Kennedy came out swinging. Although Romney had some effective parries and Kennedy occasionally tripped on his words, Romney appeared overmatched on stage with a legend. Fit and not yet 50, Ann knew something was seriously wrong. At first, Mitt held out hope that the numbness might be from a pinched nerve. In 1998, when Ann's primary care doctor referred her to a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, Mitt went along. It was there, sitting in the neurologist's waiting room, when Mitt grasped the severity of what his wife was up against. One of the brochures he spotted was about Lou Gehrig's disease, another about multiple sclerosis. There was no brochure for pinched nerves. Mitt turned to his wife and, seeing the worry in her eyes, said, ''I can deal with anything, so long as it's not fatal.'' Once in the exam room, Dr. John Stakes led Ann through a series of neurological tests - pinpricks, standing on one leg, turning around with her eyes closed. It quickly became clear she was not doing well. ''When she'd stand, for instance, with her eyes closed,'' Mitt recalled recently, ''she'd fall over.'' After the doctor left the room, Mitt recalled, Ann ''broke down and cried, and I shed tears with her.'' The confirmation of the diagnosis as multiple sclerosis would come later, after an MRI. But it was this crushing experience of watching Ann fail test after test that Mitt would describe later as the worst day of his life. Until this moment, his had been mostly a charmed life. He had suffered defeat as a candidate, but that could be dismissed as the folly of taking on an icon. Mitt's siblings, meanwhile, had all suffered setbacks, including painful divorces endured by his brother and older sister. ''My life did not remain golden. I hit bottom,'' his sister Jane says. ''But it continued for Mitt.'' Yet, seeing the love of his life have to face a potentially crippling disease changed Mitt Romney. ''It subdued him,'' Jane says. The first two years after Ann's diagnosis were particularly trying, Mitt says. ''She'd get a little better and then she'd get worse.'' Meanwhile, his mother's health was also deteriorating, and in the summer of 1998, she suffered a stroke and died. Eventually, Ann found remarkable relief through a surprising mix of treatments - mainstream, alternative, and equestrian. To supplement her traditional care, Ann found a retired 80-year-old guru of reflexology by the name of Fritz Blietschau who agreed to take her on as a patient, helping her to build muscle strength. Ann also rekindled her childhood passion of horseback riding, finding that the exercise improved her mobility and spirits. She was beginning to see how MS didn't necessarily have to mean a future in a wheelchair. The lesson was coming not in Belmont, where she had made her home for nearly 30 years, but rather in Utah, where her reflexologist and equestrian companions were both based. By early 1999, Ann and Mitt were based there as well. That's because when the call came through offering Mitt Romney the opportunity of a lifetime, it also came with a Utah address.

55,55,true/false,"Transparency and data – UKHSA’s vaccines report Vaccines work. They have played a critical role in breaking the link between infection and severe outcomes, and we should express our gratitude to the scientists who developed life-saving vaccines against COVID-19 and to those who work tirelessly every day to roll out the vaccine programme at pace, across the country.  In this blog I would like to explain how we use different data sets to look at the impact of vaccination in the population.  The UK Health Security Agency is committed to openness around data and has been at the forefront of publishing evidence to show the effectiveness of the UK vaccination programme. We were first to show that COVID-19 vaccines offer high protection against the Delta variant of the virus and this data has been regularly shared with policymakers and the public.  As well as this, the UKHSA publishes rates of cases, hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status, and the data in our report shows that the rates of hospitalisation and deaths are substantially lower in fully vaccinated people, across all age groups. It is clear therefore that COVID-19 vaccines provide a high level of protection against severe outcomes.  To make our data less susceptible to misinterpretation, the UK Health Security Agency has worked with the UK Statistics Authority to update some of the data tables and descriptions in the report, specifically around rates of infection in vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. In our commitment to transparent and clear data, we regularly review our publications to ensure they reflect the current situation within the pandemic, and we will continue to work with our partners at the statistics bodies, to ensure our reporting is as scientifically robust as possible.  Case rates in vaccinated versus unvaccinated people  UKHSA publishes vaccine effectiveness by vaccine and has done for many months. This is the source that should be used to understand how effective vaccines are in the population as there is a well-established method for calculating this.  We separately publish the rates of COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths in vaccinated and unvaccinated groups by age. This is important to understand the implications of the pandemic to the NHS and to help understand where to prioritise vaccination delivery.  A simple comparison of COVID-19 case rates in those who are vaccinated and unvaccinated should not be used to assess how effective a vaccine is in preventing serious health outcomes. This is because these figures are susceptible to a number of differences between the groups, other than the vaccine itself, and these biases mean that you cannot use the rates to determine how well the vaccines work.  If we look at the numbers of cases in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated people, the rate of cases in the vaccinated people appears higher for many age groups. This is because there are key differences in the characteristics and behaviour of individuals who are vaccinated compared to those who are unvaccinated. The rates therefore reflect this population's behaviour and exposure to COVID-19, not how well the vaccines work. We also know that, as infection rates have been high over the summer, many people were previously infected, and this has had an impact on the rate of infection in recent weeks.  Several important factors can affect the rates of diagnosed COVID-19 cases and this may result in a lower rate in unvaccinated than in vaccinated people. For example:  People who are fully vaccinated may be more health conscious and therefore more likely to get tested for COVID-19 and so more likely to be identified as a case (based on the data provided by the NHS Test and Trace).  Many of those who were at the head of the queue for vaccination are those at higher risk from COVID-19 due to their age, their occupation, their family circumstances or because of underlying health issues.  People who are fully vaccinated and people who are unvaccinated may behave differently, particularly with regard to social interactions and therefore may have differing levels of exposure to COVID-19.  People who have never been vaccinated are more likely to have caught COVID-19 in the weeks or months before the period of the cases covered in the report. This gives them some natural immunity to the virus for a few months which may have contributed to a lower case rate in the past few weeks.  These factors are all accounted for in our published analyses of vaccine effectiveness which uses the test-negative case control approach. This is a recommended method of assessing vaccine effectiveness that compares the vaccination status of people who test positive for COVID-19, with those who test negative.  This method helps to control for different propensity to have a test and we are able to exclude those known to have been previously infected with COVID-19. We also control for important factors including geography, time period, ethnicity, clinical risk group, living in a care home and being a health or social care worker.  We calculate the rate of cases in people who are vaccinated by taking the number of people who have tested positive and who have been vaccinated, and comparing to the total number of people who have been vaccinated in each age group.  The denominator  To calculate the percentage of people who have been vaccinated, we need to know how many people are eligible to receive the vaccination, this is called the denominator. Although it would seem straightforward, there is a degree of uncertainty about the true denominator. The two sources that are most commonly used to derive a denominator are:  The NHS national register (called NIMS) includes everyone who registered with the NHS and is therefore eligible to be called forward for a vaccine. Although NIMS is not perfect, it represents each unique individual who is being targeted for the vaccination programme and provides the only comparable information on key criteria for those who are targeted and those who are vaccinated. One of the basic problems with NIMS is that it contains some people who were registered with the NHS but may have moved – for example overseas – but these people have not yet been removed from the database – these are often called “ghosts”. Because vaccine uptake has been so high, even a small number of additional people included in the database will inflate the number recorded as unvaccinated – so this makes the rate of COVID-19 cases in some of the younger unvaccinated groups appear lower than it should be.  The second main denominator is the Office of National Statistics (ONS) which provides an estimate of the total number of people in each age group in the middle of each year. This is based on the 2011 census, and it updates the estimates each year using other surveys and sources of data. Using this population estimate as a denominator would potentially avoid some of the “ghost” people in the younger age groups – but it would also give rise to other issues. As the ONS data is not based on a list of unique individuals, it does not allow linking of a COVID-19 case to an individual’s vaccination status. This limits any analysis of uptake by some key criteria. As well as this, the current estimates seem to be undercounting in some older age groups. As rates of COVID-19 in older people are those we need to be most concerned about, because these age groups are at highest risk of hospitalisation and death – using the ONS denominator gives some inconsistent age-specific rates for these more severe outcomes.  Neither is perfect, however for estimating rates of cases by vaccination status we consider that using NIMS to identify those who are vaccinated and those who are unvaccinated is the best way to provide stable and comparable data, even though we accept that the infection rates in unvaccinated younger groups may seem lower than the true figure. These figures are useful for planning, for example in understanding workload in hospitals, but should not be used for assessing how effective the vaccine is. Vaccine effectiveness analysis of routine data is only possible by using the variables coded in NIMS and available at an individual level for all people who come forward for a test.  What data should we be looking at?  Data on COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths is much less prone to bias, as testing is more complete, and so it is more valid to compare rates for these severe outcomes. But even so a properly conducted analysis is much more reliable, as explained above.  Our publication of COVID-19 vaccine surveillance data is consistent with all the other vaccine surveillance data we publish and this consistency is important for understanding the patterns we see across all of our surveillance data sources. We have consistently published the data in this way, aligned to other vaccine surveillance data, since early in the year.  We believe that transparency - coupled with explanation – remains the best way to deal with misinformation. UKHSA has been committed to regular publishing of our vaccine effectiveness data and sharing this evidence promptly with others – this has played a huge role in increasing vaccine confidence in this country and worldwide."
56,56,true/false,"What is thermodynamics? Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with the relationships between heat and other forms of energy. In particular, it describes how thermal energy is converted to and from other forms of energy and how thermal energy affects matter.  Thermal energy is the energy a substance or system has due to its temperature — in other words, the energy of moving or vibrating molecules — according to the University of Kentucky (opens in new tab). Thermodynamics involves measuring this energy, which can be ""exceedingly complicated,"" David McKee, a professor of physics at Missouri Southern State University told Live Science. ""The systems that we study in thermodynamics … consist of very large numbers of atoms or molecules interacting in complicated ways. But, if these systems meet the right criteria, which we call equilibrium, they can be described with a very small number of measurements or numbers. Often this is idealized as the mass of the system, the pressure of the system, and the volume of the system, or some other equivalent set of numbers.""  Heat  Thermodynamics, then, is concerned with several properties of matter; foremost among these is heat. Heat is energy transferred between substances or systems due to a temperature difference between them, according to Georgia State University (opens in new tab). As a form of energy, heat is conserved — it cannot be created or destroyed. It can, however, be transferred from one place to another. Heat can also be converted to and from other forms of energy. For example, a steam turbine can convert heat to kinetic energy to run a generator that converts kinetic energy to electrical energy. A light bulb can convert this electrical energy to electromagnetic radiation (light), which, when absorbed by a surface, is converted back into heat. Throughout this process, a portion of the energy is lost to entropy.  Temperature  Comparing the freezing and melting points of water (in Celsius). (Image credit: Why Design via Shutterstock)  The amount of heat transferred by a substance depends on the speed and number of atoms or molecules of that substance in motion, according to Georgia State University (opens in new tab). The faster the atoms or molecules move, the higher the temperature, and the more atoms or molecules that are in motion, the greater the quantity of heat they transfer.  Temperature is ""a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a sample of matter, expressed in terms of units or degrees designated on a standard scale,"" according to the American Heritage Dictionary (opens in new tab). The most commonly used temperature scale is Celsius, which is based on the freezing and boiling points of water, assigning respective values of 0 C and 100 C. The Fahrenheit scale is also based on the freezing and boiling points of water, which have assigned values of 32 degrees Fahrenheit and 212 F, respectively.  Scientists worldwide, however, use the Kelvin (K with no degree sign) scale, named after William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, because it's based on total thermal energy rather than the freezing and boiling points of water, according to the National Library of Scotland (opens in new tab). This scale uses the same increments as the Celsius scale; for example, a temperature change of 1 C is equal to 1 K. However, the Kelvin scale starts at absolute zero, the temperature at which there is a total absence of heat energy, and all molecular motion stops. A temperature of 0 K is equal to minus 459.67 F or minus 273.15 C.  Specific heat  The amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a certain mass of a substance by a certain amount is called specific heat, or specific heat capacity, according to Wolfram Research (opens in new tab). The conventional unit for this is calories per gram per Kelvin. The calorie is defined as the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water at 4 C by 1 degree.  The specific heat of a metal depends almost entirely on the number of atoms in the sample and the way they bond, not the sample's mass. For instance, a kilogram of aluminum can absorb about seven times more heat than a kilogram of lead. A given mass of water, however, can absorb nearly five times as much heat as an equal mass of aluminum, thanks to the strong forces binding the water molecules, according to Southeastern Louisiana University (opens in new tab).  Thermal conductivity  A central processing unit (CPU) is an essential part of a computer's hardware components. (Image credit: Narumon Bowonkitwanchai via Getty Images)  Thermal conductivity (k) is ""the rate at which heat passes through a certain cross-section of a specified material,"" according to Debdatta Ratna's ""Thermosets"" (opens in new tab) (Woodhead Publishing limited, 2012). The unit for k is watts (W) per meter (m) per Kelvin (K), according to Swarthmore College (opens in new tab). Values of k for metals such as copper and silver are relatively high at 380 and 420 W/m·K, respectively. This property makes these materials useful for automobile radiators and cooling fins for computer chips because they can carry away heat quickly and exchange it with the environment. The highest value of k for any natural substance is diamond at 2,200 W/m·K, according to a 2009 study published in the journal Materials (opens in new tab).  Other materials are useful because they are extremely poor conductors of heat; this property is referred to as thermal resistance, or R-value, which describes the rate at which heat is transmitted through the material. These materials, such as fiberglass, goose down, and Styrofoam, are used for insulation in exterior building walls, winter coats, and thermal coffee mugs. R-value is given in units of square feet times degrees Fahrenheit times hours per British thermal unit (opens in new tab) (ft2·°F·h/Btu), according to OpenStax (opens in new tab), an open-source textbook.  Newton's Law of Cooling  In 1701, Sir Isaac Newton first stated his Law of Cooling in a short article titled ""Scala graduum Caloris"" (opens in new tab) (""A Scale of the Degrees of Heat"") in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. Newton's statement of the law translates from the original Latin as, ""the excess of the degrees of the heat ... were in geometrical progression when the times are in an arithmetical progression."" Worcester Polytechnic Institute (opens in new tab) gives a more modern version of this scientific law as ""the rate of change of temperature is proportional to the difference between the temperature of the object and that of the surrounding environment.""  This results in an exponential decay (opens in new tab) in the temperature difference. For example, if a warm object is placed in a cold bath, within a certain length of time, the difference between the two temperatures will decrease by half. Then in that same length of time, the remaining difference will again decrease by half. This repeated halving of the temperature difference will continue at equal time intervals until it becomes too small to measure. At that point, the system is in thermal equilibrium.  Heat transfer  Diagram showing how heat transfer works. (Image credit: blueringmedia via Getty Images)  Heat can be transferred from one body to another or between a body and the environment by three different means: conduction, convection, and radiation. Conduction is the transfer of energy through a solid material. Conduction between bodies occurs when they are in direct contact, and molecules transfer their energy across the interface.  Convection is the transfer of heat to or from a fluid medium. Molecules in a gas or liquid in contact with a solid body transmit or absorb heat to or from that body and then move away, allowing other molecules of the fluid to move into place and repeat the process.  Radiation is the emission of energy via electromagnetic (EM) radiation, particularly infrared photons that carry heat energy. All matter emits and absorbs some EM radiation, the net amount of which determines whether this causes a loss or gain in heat, according to Northwestern University (opens in new tab).  The Carnot cycle  In 1824, Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot (opens in new tab) proposed a model for a heat engine based on what has come to be known as the Carnot cycle, according to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (opens in new tab). The cycle exploits the relationships among pressure, volume, and temperature of gases, as well as how an input of energy can change form and do work outside the system.  The first step in the Carnot cycle is isothermal expansion, where a gas in a cylinder under pressure from a piston is kept at a constant temperature, but a heat source is brought in contact with the cylinder. To maintain the same temperature, the gas must expand. Next, adiabatic expansion, or expansion without heat transfer to the surrounding environment, removes weight from the piston to allow the gas to expand further, which helps it push on a cylinder to do work. Next, the gas is cooled at a constant temperature and compressed by adding weight to the piston to raise the pressure in the gas, at which point heat transfers from the gas back to the heat source. And finally, adiabatic compression adds more weight to the piston to further increase the pressure of the gas and, therefore, increase its temperature. Then the cycle repeats, according to NASA (opens in new tab). This is the basic principle behind heat pumps used for heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration, according to Georgia State University (opens in new tab).  Entropy  All thermodynamic systems generate waste heat. This waste results in an increase in entropy, which is a measure of the disorder of a system. Because work comes from ordered molecular motion, entropy is a measure of the energy that's not available to do work, according to Britannica (opens in new tab). Entropy in any closed system always increases; it never decreases. Additionally, moving parts produce waste heat due to friction, and radiative heat inevitably leaks from the system.  This makes so-called perpetual motion machines impossible. Siabal Mitra, a professor of physics at Missouri State University, told Live Science ""You cannot build an engine that is 100% efficient, which means you cannot build a perpetual motion machine. However, there are a lot of folks out there who still don't believe it, and there are people who are still trying to build perpetual motion machines.""  Entropy is also defined as ""a measure of the disorder or randomness in a closed system,"" which also inexorably increases. You can mix hot and cold water, but because a large cup of warm water is more disordered than two smaller cups containing hot and cold water, you can never separate it back into hot and cold without adding energy to the system. Put another way, you can't unscramble an egg or remove cream from your coffee. Entropy, therefore, provides us with an arrow of time: forward is the direction of increasing entropy.  The four laws of thermodynamics  The fundamental principles of thermodynamics were originally expressed in three laws. Later, scientists figured out that a more fundamental law had been neglected, apparently because it had seemed so obvious that it did not need to be stated explicitly. To form a complete set of rules, scientists decided this most fundamental law needed to be included. The problem, though, was that the first three laws had already been established and were well known by their assigned numbers. When faced with the prospect of renumbering the existing laws, which would cause considerable confusion, or placing the pre-eminent law at the end of the list, which would make no logical sense, British physicist Ralph H. Fowler came up with an alternative that solved the dilemma: he called the new law the ""Zeroth Law,"" according to Saint Anselm College (opens in new tab). Here are all four laws in brief:  The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics states that if two bodies are in thermal equilibrium with some third body, then they are also in equilibrium with each other. This establishes temperature as a fundamental and measurable property of matter.  The First Law of Thermodynamics states that the total increase in the energy of a system is equal to the increase in thermal energy plus the work done on the system. This states that heat is a form of energy and is therefore subject to the principle of conservation — that is, it can be neither created nor destroyed.  The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that heat energy cannot be transferred from a body at a lower temperature to a body at a higher temperature without the addition of energy. This is why it costs money to run an air conditioner.  The Third Law of Thermodynamics states that the entropy of a perfect crystal — that is, a substance made up of atoms arranged in a perfectly ordered, symmetrical pattern — at absolute zero is zero. As explained above, entropy is sometimes called ""waste energy,"" or the energy that is unable to do work; and since there is no heat energy whatsoever at absolute zero, there can be no waste energy. Entropy is also a measure of the disorder in a system, and while a perfect crystal is by definition perfectly ordered, any positive value of temperature means there is motion within the crystal, which causes disorder. For these reasons, there can be no physical system with lower entropy, so entropy always has a positive value.  The science of thermodynamics has been developed over centuries, and its principles apply to nearly every device ever invented. Its importance in modern technology cannot be overstated.

57,57,true/false,"Has volcanic activity been increasing? Has volcanic activity been increasing?  The Global Volcanism Program does not see any evidence that volcanic activity is actually increasing. Data about eruptions has been compiled by the Smithsonian since 1968 in order to provide context for global volcanism. The following figures and discussion are modified from an introductory section in Siebert et al. (2010); data is through 2009, but more recent data is available. Please do not reproduce the figures below without all of the accompanying analysis and proper citation (links are preferred). There is great value in knowing the recent volcanological record, but its limitations are not always apparent. Readers are strongly cautioned against mistaking the record for the reality.  The last 200 years of the volcanological record (figure 1), with humans distributed over most of the globe and relatively efficient communications, would seem to be the well-suited to search for episodic trends. However, even in the last two centuries any real trends are overshadowed by reporting factors such as historical events, technological changes, and exploration influences. The apparent increase in activity reflects increases in populations living near volcanoes to observe eruptions and improvements in communication technologies to report those eruptions. The best evidence that these trends are apparent rather than real comes from the record of large eruptions, whose effects are far reaching and less likely to escape documentation even in remote areas. Their constancy over the past two centuries is a better indicator of the global frequency of eruptions than the improved reporting of smaller eruptions.  Figure 1. Graph showing the number of volcanoes reported to have been active each year since 1800 CE. Total number of volcanoes with reported eruptions per year (thin upper black line) and 10-year running mean of same data (thick upper red line). Lower lines show only the annual number of volcanoes producing large eruptions (>= 0.1 km3 of tephra or magma) and scale is enlarged on the right axis; thick red lower line again shows 10-year running mean. See text for discussion.  Inspection of data since 1800 CE shows some major ""peaks and valleys"" which suggest global pulsations. A closer look at the two largest valleys, however, shows that they coincide with the two World Wars, when people (including publishers) were preoccupied with other things. Great economic crises, like wars, might also be expected to interfere with the reporting of natural events. One of the most precipitous drops in reported volcanism followed the stock market collapse of 1929 and during the ensuing Great Depression. From the late 1920's to the early 1930's, every volcanic region in the world – except those of Russia, Melanesia, and the West Indies – showed a drop in reported active volcanoes. In the war years of 1941-45 the number reported active in the western Pacific and Indonesia dropped by nearly one-third from the preceding 5 years, while regions less affected by the war showed little change. With more observers in more remote areas during World War II, it seems likely that more eruptions than normal were actually witnessed, but it is easy to appreciate why many of these reports do not survive in the available literature.  If these apparent drops in activity are caused by decreased human attention to volcanoes, then it is reasonable to expect that increased attention after major newsworthy eruptions should result in above-average numbers being reported. The 1902 disasters at Mont Pelee (about 29,000 victims), St. Vincent, and Santa Maria were highly newsworthy events. They represent a genuine pulse in Caribbean volcanism, but we believe that the higher numbers in following years (and following Krakatau in 1883 with more than 36,000 victims) result from increased human interest. People reported events that they might not otherwise have, and editors were more likely to print those reports.  Strong evidence that the historical trend in volcanism is more apparent than real comes from the lower plot of figure 1. Here only the larger eruptions generating at least 0.1 km3 of tephra (VEI >= 4), the fragmental products of explosive eruptions, are plotted. The effects of these larger events are often regional, and therefore less likely to escape documentation even in remote areas. The frequency of these events has remained impressively constant for more than a century, and contrasts strongly with the apparent increase of smaller eruptions with time. The effects of these large eruptions are far reaching and thus they are less likely to escape documentation even in remote areas.  More recent major eruptions have not had this effect, in part due to more systematic cataloging and media focus on volcanic events. The newsworthiness of an eruption depends more on its location and human impact than on its size. The 1980 St. Helens eruption, for example, generated enormous media attention, while the remarkably similar 1956 eruption of Bezymianny in sparsely populated Kamchatka, in which no lives were lost, was hardly noticed by the world press. Similarly, the 1991 Pinatubo eruption, with its many fatalities and effects on nearby military bases, was front page news, but the eruption of Cerro Hudson that year in isolated southern Chile created barely a ripple in international interest.  A sharp rise in reported active volcanoes immediately post-WW II was followed by another steep increase in the early 1950s that has no obvious relationship to historic events. There is then a transition from a sequence of peaks and valleys to a more uniform pattern. This corresponds to the establishment of three venues of global eruption documentation: the beginning of the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World series with eruption-rich Indonesia in 1951, publication of the annual Bulletin of Volcanic Eruptions of the Volcanological Society of Japan in 1960, and Smithsonian cataloging beginning in 1968.  Yet another rise in reported activity can be noted in the late 1990s. Several new reporting effects appear to have contributed to this change. These include widespread availability of internet access and the corresponding ability to quickly and easily transmit or publish reports, the increased utilization of remote-sensing satellite data by volcano observatories, the onset of systematic reporting of ash plumes by the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAACs) to mitigate aircraft-ash interactions, and the deployment of new satellite technology starting in December 1999 with NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra satellite. Its MODIS infrared sensors have detected volcanic eruptions in sparsely populated or rarely visited regions. These collective ""eyes in the skies"" have detected eruptions that might otherwise go unreported. Another contributing factor may have been the onset of more systematic weekly documentation of current volcanism by the Smithsonian and USGS in 2000.  The last 600 years of apparent global volcanism can be displayed by plotting the number of volcanoes known to have been active each year (figure 2). At first glance the nearly exponential increase through recent centuries suggests that the planet may soon be overwhelmed by volcanic activity, but this increase tracks the striking growth of global population (dashed line on figure 1) that has spread potential observers of eruptions over much of the Earth and the technological advances that have facilitated reporting of those eruptions. Another indicator of the growth of the record is the increase in the total number of known historically active volcanoes (upper line on figure 2). These are not newly-formed volcanoes, but already established features (or volcanic fields) that clearly had numerous previous eruptions. If a list had been continuously kept, about 2000 years ago it would have contained only the names of nine Mediterranean volcanoes and West Africa's Mount Cameroon. In the next ten centuries the list would have grown by only 30 names, 18 of them Japanese. Although newly settled Iceland soon added seven volcanoes, the list totaled only 63 by 1400 CE.  Figure 2. Graph showing known historically active volcanoes, number of volcanoes reported to be active each year, and population. The line labeled ""Known Historically Active Volcanoes"" (right scale) is the cumulative number of volcanoes with an historically recorded eruption by that year. ""Volcanoes Active Per Year"" since 1400 CE (black line) and 10-year running mean of same data (thick red line) is also based on reported eruptions (those with uncertainty dates greater than 1 year are not included, nor are uncertain eruptions). ""Population"" (right scale) is the world's estimated human population; data from McEvedy and Jones (1978) and (since 1750) Population Reference Bureau, Washington, D.C. See text for further explanation.  A dramatic increase in both the number of historically active volcanoes and recorded eruptions took place about 1500 CE. These resulted in part from the great Spanish/Portuguese marine explorations – the Age of Discovery – around the end of the 15th century, when explorers opened Latin America and much of the western Pacific to European record-keeping. Perhaps equally important was the development and widespread distribution of the printing press in the late 15th century, markedly increasing the likelihood that new volcanological records would survive. Through the 17th and into the early 18th century the recognition of additional active volcanoes generally corresponded with steadily increasing eruption reports. By the 18th century global trade was flourishing, the Industrial Revolution was under way, and the heightened reporting of eruptions noticeably accelerated the discovery of new volcanoes. The list has continued to grow, with several important volcanic regions such as New Zealand, Alaska, and Hawaii being unrepresented until the last 250 years.

58,58,true/false,"American Academy of Pediatrics Applauds CDC Advisory Committee's Approval of Safe, Effective COVID-19 Vaccine for Children Ages 5-11 Pediatricians are eager to help protect children and families by administering the vaccine, the most effective prevention tool available since the start of the pandemic  ITASCA, IL—The American Academy of Pediatrics supports today’s recommendation by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to recommend the use of a COVID-19 vaccine in children ages 5-11. The AAP urges families to check with their pediatrician and community health care providers about how to get their eligible children vaccinated, pending a final recommendation from the CDC.  Vaccinating children will protect children’s health and allow them to fully engage in all of the activities that are so important to their health and development. Parents can enjoy greater peace of mind gathering with family members this winter and sending their children to school, sports and other events that were paused during the height of the pandemic.  “Sharing this life-saving vaccine with our children is a huge step forward and provides us all with more confidence and optimism about the future,” said AAP President Lee Savio Beers, MD, FAAP. “Pediatricians are eager to participate in the immunization process and talk with families about this vaccine. We want to ensure that access to this vaccine is equitable, and that every child is able to benefit.”  Immediately after the ACIP vote to recommend the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 to 11, the AAP published its updated recommendations for COVID-19 vaccine, including a strong recommendation for children in this age group to receive the vaccine pending the final decision by the CDC. The AAP recommends COVID-19 vaccination for all children and adolescents 5 years of age and older who do not have contraindications using a vaccine authorized for use for their age. Children with prior COVID-19 infection or disease should receive a COVID-19 vaccination to prevent a second infection and to lower the risk of severe illness and hospitalization.  The Academy also updated its interim school guidance, which calls for the continued use of layers of protection, including universal mask-wearing in schools to protect all students and adults. AAP strongly advocates for in-person learning, which can happen safely with adherence to recommended policies and procedures. The guidance revision emphasizes the importance of immunization and masking as the most important risk mitigation strategies, as supported by new evidence.  “We know from our experience with the Delta variant that this virus is unpredictable, and we cannot afford to be complacent. It is critical to use science and data to guide our decisions about the pandemic and school COVID-19 plans,” Dr. Beers said. “We have also entered flu season, and now have an opportunity for children to receive vaccinations for both the flu and COVID-19, which can be done during a single visit.”  The AAP recognizes that disparities in school funding, quality of school facilities, educational staffing, and resources for enriching curricula among schools have been exacerbated by the pandemic. Ongoing federal, state, and local funding should be provided for all schools so they can continue to implement all the COVID-19 mitigation and safety measures required to protect students and staff.

59,59,true/false,"White House now is not the time to talk about gun control but if you look to Chicago Thousands of new mothers with post-natal depression are being left without support because of a woeful lack of care. NHS figures show 43 per cent of health boards provide no specialised maternal mental health service. And in those areas that do have a service, only a third meet the recommended standards. NHS figures show 43 per cent of health boards provide no specialised maternity service, and in those areas that do have a service, only a third meet the recommended standards An estimated 140,000 women giving birth each year are thought to suffer depression, anxiety or other mental health problems during pregnancy or in the months after birth. Thousands never get the support they need, and suicide is a leading cause of death in expectant and new mothers. After years of insufficient funding, NHS England has finally agreed to act, pledging £365million over the next five years. Officials today launch a £5million development fund for health boards to tackle the problem, which they hope will treat 30,000 new or expectant mothers a year. Experts have long warned that post-natal depression had gone ignored. Yet the cost of treating the problem is minimal, adding an estimated £83 to the £2,800 average cost of maternity care. Left untreated, however, the cost rises to an average of £10,000 per woman. Vicki Nash, of mental health charity Mind, welcomed the new funding, but added: ‘Too many simply don’t get the right support in these vital months. This can lead to catastrophic consequences. ‘It is vitally important now that NHS England and clinical commissioning groups take this opportunity to work together and ensure that this money gets to the frontline fast.’ Consultant psychiatrist Dr Alain Gregoire, chairman of the Maternal Mental Health Alliance, said: ‘In many parts of the country there are no services at all, not even someone who can give some advice. It doesn’t cost a great deal, which makes it even more scandalous that they haven’t done anything before. I WAS CONVINCED I MIGHT HARM MY THREE-MONTH-OLD Natalie Ellis, 32, first noticed something was wrong when her son Finn was born. ‘I started to feel down when I was breastfeeding, and thought it was a bit strange, but I didn’t think much of it,’ the mother from Sheffield said. But when Finn was three months old, she saw a news story about sexual abuse involving a baby. Natalie Ellis, 32, first noticed something was wrong when her son Finn was born She said: ‘I started to think about it happening to Finn. Over the next few months I became obsessed with it, and then I turned against myself. ‘I became convinced that I might hurt my baby. Obviously I had no intention of doing anything to him – but I became convinced I might.’ Miss Ellis became suicidal, convincing herself that Finn would be safer if she were dead. But then she read online that obsessing about harming a baby was a symptom of post-natal depression - and could often include thoughts about sexual abuse. She had counselling and therapy, and was given medication. ‘The problem is that people just don’t talk about it,’ she said. ‘If I had known that it was an illness, it would never have got that bad - I thought it was just me. ‘We need much more awareness of the symptoms.’ Miss Ellis is now training to be a radiographer and is engaged to partner Matt Williams, 36. Their son is now six years old and at primary school. Advertisement ‘The Government is seeming to wake up to this at last, but we need to see whether the NHS at a local level actually delivers change. ‘The human cost is huge. It has an impact on the women themselves, and on the whole family. The suffering is immense and can go on and on if it is not treated properly.’ NHS figures show that 91 of England’s 211 clinical commissioning groups – 43 per cent – have no specialist community perinatal mental health team. Only 30 groups – 14 per cent of the total – meet the standards set by the Royal College of Psychiatry. Dr Giles Berrisford, the NHS’s associate national clinical director for perinatal mental health, said: ‘We absolutely need to ensure that all women have the access to high quality perinatal mental health care and are committed to addressing current issues and variation. I am delighted that we can use this fund to build capacity in the community.’"
60,60,true/false,"Vaccines beat natural immunity in fight against COVID-19 A common reason cited for not getting vaccinated against COVID-19—especially among the young and healthy—is ""I trust my immune system"" or some variation of that line. The same goes for those who have already had the virus and assume they've developed some natural immunity.  Though the human immune system is indeed an extraordinary mechanism, it's not worth gambling with a disease as unpredictable and serious as COVID-19, says infectious disease expert Anna Durbin, a professor of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.  ""It's Russian roulette,"" she says. ""Young people tend to think they're invincible. But it just takes that one slip and your entire life could change.""  With the delta variant, we're seeing many more young people on ventilators in hospitals and dying, Durbin says. And declining the vaccine is more than just a personal decision: An infected person can easily transmit the virus to others, including immunocompromised people at higher risk for grave illness and children under 12 who can't yet access the vaccines.  During a conversation with the Hub, Durbin, a faculty member at the Center for Immunization Research, talked about some of the popular misconceptions surrounding natural immunity and the purpose of vaccines.  What would you say to someone who wants to put their faith in their own immune system with COVID-19?  It's not a good idea. Yes, natural infection does provide some immunity, so the next time you get that disease, you won't get as sick. But here's the problem: Your first encounter with that disease could go very wrong. With COVID-19, you could end up very ill, you could end up in the hospital, or you could die. We're seeing huge rates of hospitalizations and deaths, and you don't want to risk becoming one of those statistics. And there are other potential complications: You could lose your sense of taste and smell for months, you could develop long-haul COVID-19. It's an unpredictable disease, and we don't know how it's going to hit different people.  That's where the vaccines come in. Vaccines provide protection without any of the morbidities you can get with a natural COVID-19 protection. We don't have vaccines for things like the common cold because most people don't get very sick from that, so it's not worth the effort to make different vaccines for every different cold virus. But when we see viruses or other bacteria that can cause severe illness, like COVID-19, we need the protection of a vaccine to prevent the hospitalizations and deaths. Vaccines are the reason we no longer see so many other diseases that people suffered from in the past: smallpox, measles, polio, even chicken pox.  For those who have already had COVID-19 in the past, why would a vaccine still be necessary?  The vaccines still lower your risks. We have evidence showing that if you've been naturally infected with COVID-19 and you aren't vaccinated, your risk of getting reinfected with symptomatic disease is about 2.5–fold higher. When you introduce the vaccine to someone who's already had COVID-19, the body says, ""Hey, I remember that, I'm going to stimulate the immune response so you're protected."" You're pumping up your antibodies to higher levels so they can stop the virus before it enters your system.  Anna Durbin Professor, Bloomberg School of Public Health and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine ""We're seeing some breakthrough infections among vaccinated people and will continue to, but that's expected and doesn't mean the vaccines are failing.""  So would someone who's had both COVID-19 and the vaccine have the most protection possible?  There's no doubt that natural infection confers immunity, and we're seeing some evidence—not surprising—that a previous COVID-19 infection plus vaccination provides more durable protection than simply vaccines alone. But that doesn't mean that vaccinated people should go out there and try to get infected. That risk just isn't worth taking as people, even young healthy people, can get very, very sick. We want to simply stop infections from happening, full-stop, to get this virus under control and prevent it from mutating further.  What if the response to that is ""vaccinated people can transmit the virus, too,"" a fact now confirmed?  They can, but we have evidence showing that vaccinated people are less likely to both get infected and to transmit the virus, and may spread the virus for a shorter time.  Are antibody tests a reliable way for someone to assess their immunity to COVID-19?  There are a couple things that are flawed about that. First, antibody levels wane over time; that happens naturally. Second, these tests don't capture the full picture. Antibodies are just one part of the equation. They're not primarily responsible for preventing severe disease once you're infected—that's the job of your memory immune response, which remembers the pathogen it saw before and gears up to control infection. Then there's the whole other arm of your immune system called T-cells, whose job is to recognize the virus in your body, identify cells infected with the virus, and destroy those cells.  The antibody tests are designed to diagnose whether you've had the infection recently. They're not designed to tell you how your immune system is going to respond to COVID-19, or how well your vaccines are going to work.  What other misconceptions about immunity do you want to clear up?  I want people to understand that vaccination-induced immunity, like natural immunity, doesn't necessarily protect you from getting infected with COVID-19. The purpose of vaccinations is to prevent severe illness and death. So, yes, we're seeing some breakthrough infections among vaccinated people and will continue to, but that's expected and doesn't mean the vaccines are failing. Even with the delta variant, this is a success story because we're seeing vaccines for the most part do what they need to do.  Also, this topic of booster shots I think is a bit of a distraction right now. There's this idea out there that your immunity suddenly falls off a cliff at six or eight months. That's not what's happening. You still have that memory immune response, and that's why we're still seeing effectiveness against the delta variant.  The other thing I need to stress is that booster shots aren't going to stop delta. The only way we can do that is to have unvaccinated people get their initial vaccinations. That's the only way we're going to control not only delta but the emergence of other variants that could prolong or worsen this pandemic."
61,61,true/false,"Kids sick with Covid are filling up children's hospitals in areas seeing spikes As vaccination rates lag and the new delta variant surges, Covid infection rates among kids have risen and children’s hospitals are seeing a spike in medical care needs among the young patients.  The Covid surge is also stacking upon an unseasonable spike in respiratory illnesses among children typically seen only in winter. That has shrunk the bed space further in children's hospitals and expanded on the unrelenting demand on doctors and nurses.  “It is scary, especially for kids who don’t fully understand what’s going on. They’re air hungry, struggling for breath, and it’s just scary,” said Dr. Kelechi Iheagwara, medical director of the pediatric intensive care unit at the Our Lady of the Lake Children’s Hospital in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. “You have the illness, the fear, they can’t breathe, they’re isolated — that’s hard for anyone to understand, but can you imagine what it’s like for a kid?”  Kelechi Iheagwara, the medical director of Our Lady of the Lake Children's Hospital Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. Our Lady of the Lake Children's Hospital  Her hospital has treated Covid in children ages from 3-week-olds to 17-year-olds in recent weeks. Iheagawara said that for the past month, her unit has had to treat 25 or 26 patients in a space designed for 20. And things are getting worse.  Multiple doctors in the half-dozen children’s hospitals NBC News reached out to said they have seen children infected because a member of their household, often a parent, brings the coronavirus home. Oftentimes, it is because an adult in the home is unvaccinated.  “Absolutely, household infections are the beginning of this pandemic, that is a major driving force in the spread of infections. We see it often within households, parents to children,” said Dr. Jim Versalovic, the chief pathologist and interim chief pediatrician at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston. “We have certainly seen siblings — more than two at times — with an infection at the same time, so spread within households is certainly a very real phenomenon.”  The Covid-19 spike hit the Baton Rouge children's hospital in mid-July and brought its monthly total to 75 cases — the highest number of coronavirus hospitalizations during the entire pandemic. With 27 children admitted to the emergency room over the first four days of August, the hospital has already seen more child hospitalizations than it saw in the entire month of June.  Combined with the rise in out-of-season virus infections this summer, the hospital has been at bed capacity for weeks and the number of Covid cases among kids is projected to grow for the next two to three months. It remains particularly concerning as children under 12 remain the most vulnerable to Covid since they are not yet able to receive the vaccinations.  “We’re also a trauma center, so we have to be available for kids that get in car accidents and things like that,” said Dr. Trey Dunbar, the president of Our Lady of the Lake Hospital. “My fear is that with our staffing crunch, if this surge continues, how do we keep caring for the kids that we need to have beds for?”  Children’s hospitals in areas seeing a surge in Covid cases are experiencing the same pattern: More children are coming in with Covid symptoms just ahead of the start of the school year. Bed shortages and overworked doctors and nurses in children’s hospitals are becoming commonplace.  Arkansas Children’s Hospital in Little Rock had 23 patients under 18 admitted to its system last week. Ten were in the ICU and five were on ventilators.  St. Louis Children’s Hospital in Missouri saw 13 kids come to the ER for Covid in the last week of July, and then it saw 20 who needed beds in the first week of August.  At Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, Covid positivity rates have risen from around 3 percent to above 10 percent among kids. The number of hospitalized children was in the single digits several weeks ago but rose to more than 30 last week.  Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said Friday that there are 13 children hospitalized with Covid at Children's Hospital New Orleans, including six under the age of 2. Four children are in the ICU, including a 3-month-old boy, a 23-month-old girl, an 8-year-old girl and a 17-year-old boy.

Toney and his staff are dealing with are increasing numbers of Covid-19 infected children. Bob Self / Florida Times-Union via USA Today Network  ""Children in Louisiana have died of Covid and more unfortunately will die,"" said Dr. John Vanchiere, a pediatric infectious disease specialist, as he stood next to Bel Edwards at a news conference last week. ""This is not a time for politics, for fighting or threatening lawsuits about masks. Masks save lives. And if you're a pro-life Louisiana resident like I am, wear your mask.""  At least 81 children in the U.S. died of Covid between March and July, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and many doctors warn that the situation is likely to get worse.  Local reactions to these growing numbers are mixed, however. The governors of Texas and Florida, both Republicans, have refused to change course on their opposition to mask use and any other precautions, even after President Joe Biden implored them to “please help” or “get out of the way.”  Meanwhile, the Covid surge and resulting hospitalization rate have grown so bad in Arkansas that Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, recently advocated for a mask mandate in schools there. This comes months after he signed a bill banning state and local mask mandates.  Doctors and experts said that kids who returned to school last school year did so successfully because Covid precautions were in place. But as the CDC and state and local governments relaxed their guidelines this year, many of those safeguards evaporated.  “This new variant is a major contributor, but a major issue is that people’s behavior has changed,” said Gigi Gronvall, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “I don’t think we can absolve people and leaders of responsibility for this because it gives them a pass. The reason kids are getting infected is because we don’t have those precautions and parents and households are getting infected.”  Wearing masks to prevent the spread of Covid, elementary school students walk to classes to begin their school day in Godley, Texas, on Aug. 5, 2020. LM Otero / AP  Many of the doctors interviewed expressed frustration that a large number of people within their community remained unvaccinated and are even openly hostile to the measure. It is having a negative effect on morale, many said, especially as the work once again increases.  “When I say they’re tired, they’re beyond that. They’re like, ‘I’m done,’” said Dr. Jason Newland, a Washington University infectious disease physician at St. Louis Children’s Hospital. “People are saying they just don’t want to do it anymore, and so we’re growing more and more limited in bed capacity. Hospital administrators are trying to figure these staffing shortages out — hats off to them — but these conversations are difficult because it comes down to the children and these families that need to be cared for.”  Children under 12 are especially in need of that care as they are the one group that remains completely unvaccinated. The Food and Drug Administration has not released emergency authorization for them to get the shot, fueling worries as many kids are scheduled to begin school in the coming weeks.  Versalovic, whose hospital in Texas is involved in the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccine trials for kids under 12, said that they don’t anticipate sending the FDA their data until well after the start of the school year.

Jon Cherry / Getty Images file  “Hopefully, there will be emergency authorization soon after we release the data, but we have to face the reality of beginning the school year without it,” he said. “We do anticipate having vaccines available for kids during the first half of the school year, but for children under 5 that’s likely to occur later in the year, possibly early 2022. It’s going to be an ongoing effort.”  That’s tough for many to hear, even in places where Covid outbreaks have not recently spiked. In areas that are only seeing a moderate increase in cases, children’s hospitals are still worried as they combat a surge in respiratory viruses while facing the looming school year and a large population that remains unvaccinated.  Dr. Cameron Mantor, the chief medical officer at the Oklahoma Children’s Hospital in Oklahoma City, said they are contending with a number of children in hospital beds stricken with respiratory diseases normally seen in winter, as well as a depleted workforce. A surge in Covid cases, like what they saw this year or what the northeast part of the state is combating now, could overwhelm them.  “Our challenge is to figure out how we don’t get ourselves back into the situation that we had months ago,” he said. “The big question is, how do we get all these people vaccinated? How do we let them know it’s safe and very effective? How do we dispel all the myths?”"

A major audit published today also reveals that almost half of hospitals lack senior specialists at weekends. And just two out of 165 maternity units had a consultant present round the clock, according to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Scroll down for video A major audit published today also reveals that almost half of hospitals lack senior specialists at weekends. Stock image Mothers-to-be are instead left in the hands of overstretched midwives and inexperienced and often exhausted junior doctors. Although consultants are on call from home, they can live up to 30 minutes away and staff summon them only in emergencies. More than half of births take place out of hours. And research shows that babies born then are a third more likely to die or suffer serious complications. The royal college obtained the figures from 165 NHS maternity units – 82 per cent of the total. They show that: Just over 73 per cent had no consultants on the weekday overnight shift, typically 10pm to 8am; Another 43 per cent said none were on site at weekends; 89 per cent said consultants were not present for evening shifts at weekends; Heart of England NHS trust in Birmingham and Central Manchester University were the only centres with consultants day and night, all week. Maureen Treadwell, of the Birth Trauma Association, said: ‘We are concerned at the number of hospital trusts with no consultant cover at night. ‘There are a number of rare but sudden catastrophic events in labour where a less experienced doctor may need the advice or assistance of a senior colleague. ‘These are not common events, but every year some women and babies will die as a result of substandard care, often from staff who are doing their best, but may never have dealt with such a condition.’ The figures are worrying because labours are becoming more complex due to obesity and the trend for women to have babies later in life. Experts say midwives and junior doctors are less likely to spot when things go wrong and can be reluctant to summon the help of consultants. Labour wards are also under pressure because of high birth rates fuelled by migration. Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s health spokesman, said it shows that the Tories can;t even deliver a five-day NHS Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s health spokesman, said: ‘It is crucial that maternity units are sufficiently staffed to provide a high level of care to all who use them – day or night. ‘The Tories talk about a seven-day NHS but these figures show they can’t even deliver a five-day NHS.’ Elizabeth Duff of the National Childbirth Trust said: ‘Women need safe maternity services whenever they give birth. We know more needs to be done to provide the right level of staff to give support when necessary.’ The royal college issued recommendations in 2009 stating that maternity units should work toward having consultants present round the clock. This would improve the care of women and the training of junior staff, the guidelines stated. Consultants are supposed to supervise the care of all patients in maternity units and intervene if something goes wrong. A major study by Imperial College London last year found that babies delivered at the weekend were 7 per cent more likely to be stillborn. And research published by Cambridge University in 2010 found that babies born overnight or at weekends in Scottish hospitals were a third more likely to die. MY BABY WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY IF I'D HAD HER IN THE WEEK Angela Owens pictured with baby Hope believes her daughter Ella would be alive today had she given birth on a weekday Angela Owens believes her daughter Ella would be alive today had she given birth on a weekday. She was two weeks overdue when she felt severe and sudden pain on a Saturday afternoon four days before Christmas 2013. The 31-year-old went to the labour ward at Warrington Hospital, describing it as a ghost town. Midwives repeatedly told her to go home and take paracetamol – and ignored her pleas for a consultant. Eventually – after her GP brother arrived – they bleeped the consultant but by this stage it was too late. When Ella was finally delivered on 11pm on the Saturday she was stillborn. The mother, who has two other daughters with her partner Paul, said: ‘There was a general flippant attitude towards me,’ ‘You put your trust in health staff in these situations, but I had to beg them for help. ‘Hospitals seem to go into sleep mode at the weekends and for us this resulted in the ultimate tragedy. It was horrendous. I will never recover from her death.’ Ella was one of ten babies who had been stillborn or died in unexplained circumstances at Warrington Hospital in a 12-month period between 2013/14. The deaths were avoidable and blamed on staffing shortages – half occurred at weekends. Advertisement The authors said the same would be true for English hospitals. They blamed the extra risks on a lack of intervention by junior doctors. NHS figures show that doctors performed almost 40 per cent of births in 2014/15 and midwives do most of the remainder. They do not state whether the former were consultants or junior doctors. But the figure has steadily increased from 24 per cent in 1989. An NHS England spokesman said: ‘Having a baby is now safer than it has ever been and the vast majority of mothers report that they get great NHS maternity care.’ The spokesman highlighted a study last year that claimed there was no evidence to show overnight consultants made any difference to safety. But he refused to acknowledge other research showing babies born out of hours were more likely to die. Tomorrow the NHS will publish its first-ever Ofsted-style ratings for maternity care in a bid to drive up standards."

Dr. Robert Strang said he is aware of the video that garnered more than 106,000 views in 24 hours, but the claims in it are not true.  ""There's nothing at all to suggest that this is actually an event that actually occurred,"" he said.  The video was created and shared on Facebook on Thursday by a woman who claims her daughter's friend is in critical care after getting a COVID-19 vaccine because her heart repeatedly stopped.  The woman goes on to make several unfounded claims about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and encourages viewers to spread her message.  Strang said Friday that neither Emergency Health Services nor the IWK Health Centre is aware of any events taking place similar to what's reported in the video, and that ""some other information would lead us to believe that this is a false story.""  The post has received more than 100 comments expressing support, including some sharing anti-vaccination views.  'Where's the evidence?'  Strang said he encourages people who view the video to think critically.  ""I would push back and say, 'Well, where's the evidence that this actually happened?'""  Strang said it's not time to create misinformation or false narratives about the vaccines.  ""It's just not helpful. And people who put this type of misinformation out, they're actually harming other people.""  He urged everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated.  ""It's really important that everybody who can get vaccinated is vaccinated. The vaccines are effective. The vaccines are safe. Millions of people around the world have been immunized, and … we can absolutely with certainty say they're safe and effective.""  The CBC sent the woman a message asking for contact information for the family, but the woman did not reply.  A spokesperson for Facebook told the CBC on Monday that the video has been removed.  ""Our team reviewed the content and removed it for violating our misinformation and harm policies,"" said an email from David Troya-Alvarez.

64,64,true/false,"The arctics carbon bomb might be even more potent than we thought For some time, scientists fearing the mass release of greenhouse gases from the carbon-rich, frozen soils of the Arctic have had at least one morsel of good news in their forecasts: They predicted most of the gas released would be carbon dioxide, which, though a greenhouse gas, drives warming more slowly than some other gases. Scientists obviously weren’t excited about more carbon dioxide emissions, but it was better than the alternative: methane, a shorter-lived but far harder-hitting gas that could cause faster bursts of warming. Now even that silver lining is in doubt. Research released Monday suggests that methane releases could be considerably more prevalent as Arctic permafrost thaws. The research finds that in waterlogged wetland soils, where oxygen is not prevalent, tiny microorganisms will produce a considerable volume of methane, a gas that doesn’t last in the air much more than a decade but has a warming effect many times that of carbon dioxide over a period of 100 years.  What we can definitely say is that the importance of methane was underestimated until now in the carbon studies,” said Christian Knobloch, a researcher at Universität Hamburg in Germany and the lead author of the study, published in Nature Climate Change. The divergent finding came after Knoblauch and his colleagues conducted a lengthy experiment, more than seven years long, monitoring patches of submerged and artificially warmed soil from Siberia in the laboratory, and gradually seeing sensitive methane-producing microorganisms become more prevalent over time. Knoblauch contends that other studies have not examined waterlogged Arctic soils for as long, and he notes that in some cases it took three years or more for the methane-generating microorganisms to really get cranking. “What we saw is that it takes a very long time until methane starts being produced, and the study that we did is really the first one which is so long,” Knoblauch said.The research was conducted along with colleagues from several institutions in Germany, Sweden and Russia. So much methane was produced in the experiment, the researchers calculated that the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from wet soils, or wetlands, will be higher than from drier soils, where carbon dioxide should indeed be the top gas released. This finding, if further confirmed, could reorient calculations of the overall potential of permafrost to worsen global warming over the coming century. For instance, one major study of the permafrost warming potential, published in 2015 in the journal Nature, played down the potential for methane release in wet soils, saying drier soils would be the bigger problem. “In spite of the more potent greenhouse gas CH4, a unit of newly thawed permafrost carbon could have a greater impact on climate over a century if it thaws and decomposes within a drier, aerobic soil as compared to an equivalent amount of carbon within a waterlogged soil or sediment,” that research found. The new study would appear to contradict this. But Knoblauch cautions that more research would have to be done to go from these results to a forecast for just how much methane could waft from permafrost in the coming decades. It will be important to know, for instance, how much thawed permafrost will be stuck in watery conditions vs. dry ones. One Arctic permafrost expert not involved in the research, Merritt Turetsky of the University of Guelph, praised the new study, noting that the researchers had spent a long time trying to uncover the behavior of tiny methane-producing organisms in watery soil. The research, she said, could help bridge the gap between field studies of waterlogged permafrost that have detected methane emissions and laboratory studies that have seemed to play down the importance of the gas. “What’s remarkable about this study is the length of time they spent tracking the communities, and I think that offers a potential reason for why field and lab studies have disagreed with each other,” Turetsky said. She said the total amount of permafrost carbon that could be vulnerable because of global warming during this century — perhaps 10 percent of it, which would be more than enough to undermine global climate goals — probably won’t change in light of the new research. But the fraction of that carbon that is emitted as methane, as opposed to carbon dioxide, will be crucial, she said, and remains to be determined. “We absolutely have to partition that total permafrost carbon release into those two forms, because it really matters,” Turetsky said. “So I think that has got to be where the community goes next.” But Róisín Commane, a research associate at Harvard who studies the Arctic atmosphere and also was not involved in this research, was more skeptical about relying on this study to assume a worse verdict about methane. The study was “very nicely done,” she said, but the tendency of wet soils to produce methane could be counteracted by several factors. The soils could also become host to organisms that devour that methane — and turn it into carbon dioxide. And, as the Arctic continues to warm, soils might not retain as much water, as the subsurface ice that held it in place gradually gives way, she noted. “How much of it makes it into the atmosphere is the big thing,” Commane said. “Ecosystems will probably produce more methane as they stay wet. The big question we have is, how much of that makes it into the atmosphere, and I don’t think they get to that question here.”"
65,65,true/false,"Fauci: No scientific evidence the coronavirus was made in a Chinese lab Anthony “Tony” Fauci has become the scientific face of America’s COVID-19 response, and he says the best evidence shows the virus behind the pandemic was not made in a lab in China.  Fauci, the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, shot down the discussion that has been raging among politicians and pundits, calling it “a circular argument” in a conversation Monday with National Geographic.  “If you look at the evolution of the virus in bats and what's out there now, [the scientific evidence] is very, very strongly leaning toward this could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated … Everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that [this virus] evolved in nature and then jumped species,” Fauci says. Based on the scientific evidence, he also doesn’t entertain an alternate theory—that someone found the coronavirus in the wild, brought it to a lab, and then it accidentally escaped.  Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.  Fauci is most concerned that the United States will be put to the test this fall and winter by a second wave of COVID-19 if the country does not blunt the infection rate by the summer.  “Shame on us if we don't have enough tests by the time this so-called return might occur in the fall and winter,” he says, advising that the U.S. needs to make sure we not only have an adequate supply of tests available before a second wave hits, but also a system for getting those tests to the people who most need them.  “I don't think there's a chance that this virus is just going to disappear,” he says. “It's going to be around, and if given the opportunity, it will resurge.” As such, Fauci says the U.S. should also focus this summer on properly reinforcing the nation’s health care system, ensuring the availability of hospital beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment for health care workers.  He also stressed the importance of continuing to social distance everywhere until the case counts start to fall in cities and states. The U.S. witnessed about 20,000 to 30,000 new cases every day in the month of April, suggesting the country is stuck in its peak.  Still, he remains optimistic that a vaccine will be ready within an historically short time frame, citing one promising candidate that he thinks may move into advanced clinical trials by the early summer. Fauci has said that he thinks a final vaccine could be available for general use as early as January, which would break records for the speed at which previous vaccines were developed.  5:03  One reason for his confidence is the “impressive” results being seen now in animals tested with a vaccine candidate made by Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna Therapeutics, which brought it into human trials in a record 42 days. The candidate is what is known as an mRNA vaccine—a drug that uses snippets of a virus’s genetic material—rather than the dead or weakened virus itself—to build the proteins that trigger the body’s protective immune response.  To date, no type of mRNA vaccine has been licensed for use in humans, but Fauci believes there is great promise for this technology targeting the coronavirus, based in part on his experience developing treatments for HIV/AIDS in the 1980s and ‘90s.  “For some reason that we're still struggling with, the body does not make an adequate immune response to HIV,” he says. To fight off that virus, a vaccine has to work better than the body’s own natural response. By contrast, “it's obvious that many people make a very adequate immune response” to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the animal trials so far show that modest doses of the mRNA vaccine for coronavirus have also generated a strong immune response.  He adds that NIAID is still developing and supporting multiple vaccine efforts, in case those that go into trials soonest don’t ultimately prove safe and effective. “You want a lot of shots on goal. We want four or five candidates that we put out there all within a reasonable time,” he says.  Fauci told National Geographic he’s concerned about states rushing to reopen before their infection rates fall. He also shared how he manages the barrage of new scientific information being released about COVID-19, and how his family and faith keep him going despite his increasingly hectic schedule.  (The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.)  Fauci on the vaccine  You’ve been the NIAID director since 1984, witnessing dozens of disease outbreaks. One of the first was the HIV/AIDS epidemic. How does that experience compare with COVID-19?  One of the important advantages is what we call targeted drug development. Viruses cause disease by binding to receptors on cells in your body, be they in your upper airway or in your lung, in the case of COVID-19. They then replicate at a rapid rate that triggers a variety of pathogenic processes. Targeting drugs to interfere at one or more vulnerable sites within this replication cycle is something that we learned with HIV.  Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Bush presents the Presidential Medal of Freedom on June 19, 2008 to Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infections Diseases, in Bethesda, Maryland during ceremonies at the White House. The Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award, recognizes exceptional meritorious service. Photograph by Karen Bleier, AFP via Getty Images  SARS-CoV-2 [the virus that causes COVID-19] has the same sort of vulnerable points. We need to identify them and develop drugs, either alone or in combination, to block the replication.  Are there also lessons from HIV/AIDS that relate to developing a COVID-19 vaccine?  Vaccines are a bit different. We have a better chance of quickly getting, relatively speaking, a vaccine for the novel coronavirus than we did for HIV, because for some reason that’s still unknown the body does not make an adequate immune response to HIV.  We don't necessarily have that challenge with this coronavirus because it's obvious that many people make a very adequate immune response. They clear the virus, and they do well. As we know from the natural history of this disease, the majority of people actually either get well without any symptoms—they're called asymptomatic—or they have minimal symptoms, where they get a fever, some aches, and then they recover.  The fact that the majority of people can actually clear the virus is a very good sign for the feasibility of developing a vaccine.  The two most widely discussed vaccine candidates are an mRNA vaccine from Moderna, which reached human trials in a record 42 days, and Oxford University’s candidate, based on what’s known as a nonreplicating viral vector. Yet no vaccine based on these two technologies has ever been licensed for human use. What makes these two vaccines seem so promising, especially on this expedited timeline?  These vaccines are inducing, at least in animal models, really rather substantial immune responses, particularly the mRNA vaccine. When we look at the immune response that you can induce with a modest dose—one that's feasible to be translated into humans—and the amount of time it takes to get to that level of immunity, it is really quite impressive. It is also really easy to scale up with these two, in the sense of making a lot of doses pretty quickly. So you're right, they have not been approved, as many of the other vaccine platforms have, but the promise is great.  We at NIAID are either developing or supporting the development of multiple candidates. You want a lot of shots on goal. We want four or five candidates that we put out there all within a reasonable time—maybe June, July, or August—to get them into an advanced trial. The mRNA one is already well into phase one of clinical trials, and we're getting ready to go into phase two and three sometime in the early summer.  Fauci on reopening and masks  As states move to reopen businesses and warmer weather lures people outside, how concerned are you about a fresh spike in infections in the U.S.?  Take a look at the guidelines for Opening Up America Again. There are very well delineated checkpoints. There's a gateway where infections must go down for 14 days before you can enter into phase one for reopening. If you fulfill the requirements of phase one, you move to phase two. If you do it there, you go to phase three.  So when you see somebody in an environment in which the infections are not going down, and then you see 30 to 40 people on a beach with no mask … well that's very nice to have fun in the sun, but you're really putting yourself and everyone at risk for creating an even bigger spike in infections.  Do you fear a second wave?  What’s impressed me the most—but clearly in a disturbing way—is the extraordinary efficiency of how the virus spreads. It spreads so much more efficiently than influenza does. You see situations where people at home try and physically separate; they have no contact except they've touched the plate or a doorknob, and they wind up getting infected.  The clusters in families, the outbreaks on the Teddy Roosevelt aircraft carrier, the enormous spread on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama harbor—it’s a very, very transmissible virus.  Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.  We're going to be put to the test as we move toward the fall and winter of this year. If we do it correctly, then we could be able to blunt and diminish the daily rate of infections in this country as we get into the summer. I can't guarantee it, but if we do things right, that likely will happen.  But I don't think there's a chance that this virus is just going to disappear. It's going to be around, and if given the opportunity, it will resurge. We now will have a few months—May June, July, August—to prepare, by making sure our health system is adequately supplied with ventilators, ICU beds, personal protective equipment, etcetera. We need to not only have tests, but to make sure the people who need tests can get tested.  So that by the time we get to September, we don't have the dialogue continually fixating on do you have enough tests? Shame on us if we don't have enough tests by the time this so-called return might occur in the fall and winter.  What’s your position on the general public wearing face masks?  I'm glad you asked, because it has evolved over the weeks and months. When there was first discussion, it was at a time when face masks—either surgical masks or N95 respirators—were at high scarcity.  Let's assume that we now have enough masks or that you could easily make a cloth covering, as was suggested appropriately by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I think those are reasonable assumptions. We know that the masks are better in the health-care setting to prevent someone who's infected from coughing and sneezing and infecting people in the environment. When you look at what the mask does for the general population, the data are not 100 percent: It doesn't 100 percent protect you from infecting somebody else, and it certainly doesn't 100 percent prevent somebody else from infecting you.  But if you wear a mask, you are getting some protection for yourself, and if you happen to be infected and don't know it, you're to some extent preventing transmission to someone else. Given that, it just makes sense that first of all, the best way to prevent spread is to maintain the physical distance of six feet.  So, if you're in a situation where you're in contact with no one, then you don't have to be walking around with a mask all day, that's for sure. But if you are in a situation where you are going to be within the realm of six feet—the grocery store or even walking out on the street—then wear it.  Fauci on the information deluge and the “virus made in Chinese lab” claim.  How do you keep up with the barrage of information and filter down to the most important science?  It's like drinking from a fire hydrant. It really is. Fortunately for me, I have a staff of three to four really good people who sift through the papers and when something looks unreasonable or “pie in the sky,” they don't bother me with that. Then when all of these studies come across my desk, I read the title and the abstract. If it looks feasible, I'll put it aside and try and read it. When it's something that they think I should read, they make sure I read it.  Even with that screening process, it's still very difficult to consume everything that's out there, particularly with this relatively recent trend with these non-peer-reviewed, pre-publications [that have not gone through traditional vetting to appear in major journals].  So, what's your advice to the public at-large for sifting through the headlines and making sense of it all?  Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.  Anybody can claim to be an expert even when they have no idea what they're talking about—and it's very difficult for the general public to distinguish. So, make sure the study is coming from a reputable organization that generally gives you the truth—though even with some reputable organizations, you occasionally get an outlier who's out there talking nonsense. If something is published in places like New England Journal of Medicine, Science, Nature, Cell, or JAMA—you know, generally that is quite well peer reviewed because the editors and the editorial staff of those journals really take things very seriously.  One topic in the news lately has been the origins of SAR-CoV-2. Do you believe or is there evidence that the virus was made in the lab in China or accidentally released from a lab in China?  If you look at the evolution of the virus in bats, and what's out there now is very, very strongly leaning toward this [virus] could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated—the way the mutations have naturally evolved. A number of very qualified evolutionary biologists have said that everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that it evolved in nature and then jumped species.  Sure, but what if scientists found the virus outside the lab, brought it back, and then it escaped?  But that means it was in the wild to begin with. That's why I don't get what they're talking about [and] why I don't spend a lot of time going in on this circular argument.  Fauci’s life right now  What’s your typical day like?  I get up around five o'clock in the morning, and I usually wind up running downstairs, getting a quick breakfast, and looking at a thousand emails—literally a thousand.  I then head to the NIH [National Institutes of Health] for my day job—trying to develop a vaccine and drugs and running a $6 billion institution. I stay there until around one o'clock, and then I go down to the White House for multiple meetings. First, I meet with the doctor group—myself, coronavirus response coordinator Debbie Birx, director Bob Redfield from the CDC, commissioner Steve Hahn from FDA, and others. We then go into the task force meeting run by Vice President [Mike Pence], which usually lasts about an hour and a half. We summarize this pre-brief with the vice president and then go brief President [Donald Trump] for the press conference.  Then, the work starts … I head home or back to the NIH and work until the wee hours of the morning. The whole day is punctuated by everybody needing to talk to you: every governor in the states, every congressional leader, every leader in the White House. It's constant conference calls. It's an almost impossible situation—and that's seven days a week.  Then you superimpose upon that all the press you do—the TV or the radio or the interviews. It's kind of a surrealistic state. I have to wake up in the morning and literally, without being facetious, ask my wife, what day is it?  Wow, how do you unwind?  I power walk with my wife, usually at night or on the weekends. It's dark, but we still do it anyway.  Has it ever been too taxing?  A couple of months ago, I was foolish and just thought I could get away with almost no sleep. I mean, like three hours a night. I did that for a few weeks, and it almost killed me. It really wore me down badly. Thank goodness I have a very intelligent and clinically skilled wife who turned things around and said, You got to remember to eat, and you've got to remember to sleep. The day is still impossible, but I don't think I'm going to drop dead from it. I hope not.  You went to a Jesuit high school, where you learned the importance of doing good for the public. How has that experience informed your professional life?  My whole life was almost served to me on the basis that my mother and father were very much oriented toward service. They were never really interested in money or material things. That's just the way they were, both of them. So I never knew there was anything like going out there and making a lot of money, and that was really cemented when I went both to a Jesuit high school and a Jesuit college, where the entire theme was service for others.  I almost never had any other inkling of doing anything except something that would have a public service component to it. I'm very much of a people person, but I'm also scientifically inclined. My entire training is steeped in the humanities, and when you combine that with an aptitude for science, you wind up being a physician."
66,66,true/false,"Most Positive Coronavirus Tests Are True Positives In all of the times that we thought about a pandemic, in some hazy future that would probably never happen, the one thing that we mostly never foresaw was the truly epic amount of nonsense that would be produced. It seems like every second minute that a new myth about COVID-19 springs up that needs to be debunked, whether it’s the idea that drinking hot water can kill the virus (remember that from way back in April?) to the newer absurdity spreading around that most coronavirus deaths were actually caused by buses (spoiler: they weren’t). Pictured: At least 50% bigger than your average virus. Source: Pexels And so, when the newest misconception sprang up, instead of feeling elated that my purpose as a science communicator and blogger was being fulfilled, I instead felt the bone-crushing weariness that comes from total nonsense going very every single day of the year. And because this nonsense is about a pandemic disease, and policy makers do sometimes base their decisions on trash analyses published online, I felt like it’s important to address this inaccuracy as soon as possible. Which brings us here, to the claim: that 90% of all positive COVID-19 tests are false positives. This has serious implications, the story goes, because it means that there are actually virtually no cases of the disease in the country, and the government is lying to us all*. Which is, to be blunt, totally wrong. “I dropped a steaming pile of that idea on the paddock just this afternoon” Source: Pexels Let me explain. Testing For COVID-19 The main test used to determine if someone has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is called a polymerase chain reaction test or a PCR. PCR testing basically takes tiny amounts of viral DNA or RNA and amplifies it until you can detect it easily in a sample, and is one of the main ways we test for specific infections. PCR testing has a number of advantages, as well as some weaknesses. The test has a problem with identifying people who are in the early stages of infection. This is because it can be hard to get enough virus on a swab to replicate it in the test, which means that people who have only been infected 1 or 2 days ago may not be positive when they are tested. In fact, the sensitivity of the test can be as low as 40% in people who have only been infected a few days, meaning that 60% of tests are false negatives in this population. This is why many places will retest you if you are still having symptoms after a few days, even if your initial test was negative. Pictured: Somewhat less than ideal. Source: Pexels But in this blog, we’re not focusing on false negatives, we’re worried about false positives, because a few people having their COVID-19 missed is only worrisome if we care about public health rather than strange conspiracies. So, false positives. With the PCR tests used to detect COVID-19, the average number of false positives has been extremely well-calculated. We have been using these tests for decades, after all, and we’ve had the better part of a year to perfect them for this specific disease. While there were some early validations that showed slightly higher numbers of false positives, we’ve now got enormous samples run by researchers from across the world that show the rate of false positives in PCR tests for COVID-19 to be around 1 in 1,000 or lower. In other words, it is incredibly rare for a COVID-19 test that comes back positive to be a false positive. Almost unheard of. It happens, but very rarely, particularly because many tests are confirmed, i.e. run twice. Pictured: Very common these days. Source: Pexels Nonsense Numbers We can actually use two numbers, called specificity and sensitivity, to see the exact rate of tests that are ‘right’ in a population. The specificity of COVID-19 PCR tests is the ratio of true negatives to false positives+true negatives, which works out to about 99.9%. In other words, for every 1,000 people you test who truly don’t have the disease, you get 1 test that is falsely positive. Sensitivity is the ratio of true positives to false negatives+true positives, and while this is also high it’s not quite as high as specificity, averaging out around 98% or thereabouts. This means that for every 1,000 people you test who do have a coronavirus infection, you’ll miss about 20 true cases. Let’s imagine a population where about 50 in 1,000 people actually have COVID-19. You test all of them with PCR tests. Of the 950 people without the disease, you’ll get an average of one false positive test. Of the 50 people who do in fact have the disease, you’ll miss 1 person, which means 49 true positives. In this case, 98% of all positives are true positives, with just 1/49 tests being a false positive. You’ll also have missed one true positive, so your estimated prevalence — the proportion of people who you think have COVID-19 — is actually correct at 50/1,000. Pictured: According to stock photo websites, all science is test tubes or astronomy Source: Pexels Even with very low numbers of infections, the spectacularly high specificity of PCR tests means that you almost never have more false positives than true positives. If we repeat the calculation for a situation where only 50 in 10,000 people have COVID-19 in our sample, we still find 49 true positives and 10 false positives, which means our ‘correct’ percentage is now 83% — still very high, given the low population prevalence in the people we’re testing. In real life, it’s rare that so few of the people we test actually have the disease, because we target testing at those with symptoms and who think that they might be getting sick. And we can see this incredible accuracy happening in real life. In Australia, despite hundreds of thousands of tests conducted every week, there are vanishingly few positive results. In New South Wales, the state that I live in, we conduct more than 115,000 tests every week with <40 positive results. Even if every one of those were a false positive, the false positive rate would still be less than a fraction of 0.1%. More broadly, it is simply wrong to suggest that most tests coming back positive for COVID-19 are false positives. In reality, the simple truth is that most positive tests are just that: positive. The number of people who are sick with COVID-19 is increasing in many places in the world — particularly the UK — despite what certain inaccurate blogs might have you believe. This is the sad truth, and nothing more."
67,67,true/false," A coalition of civil society groups has described the proposed Control of Infectious Diseases Bill as a threat to human rights. The group, 41 in total, said the House of Representatives must subject the bill to public scrutiny by embarking on stakeholders’ consultations and a public hearing to harness public inputs into the legislation. Many Nigerians had criticised a move by the House of Representatives to repeal the Quarantine Act and replace it with the Control of Infectious Diseases Bill. The bill, which scaled second reading before it was stood down last week, has 82 sections. Sponsored by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, the bill seeks to strengthen the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and make it more proactive and “not just reactive and function when there is an outbreak.” The bill seeks to empower the president, the minister of health as well as the director-general of NCDC, and the institutions they head, to make regulations on quarantining, vaccination and prevention of infectious diseases in Nigeria. CSOs position In a statement issued on Tuesday, the groups said the bill empowers NCDC to restrict fundamental rights and freedoms of the people. “The Bill empowers the NCDC to restrict fundamental rights and freedoms at will, and abuse constitutionally established institutions and processes, without any form of accountability. “For instance, Section 10 (3) gives the Director-General express powers to use force to enter any premises without a warrant,” it said. The group also said the bill violates key principles of legislative drafting rules mandating laws to be simple, clear and unambiguous. It, therefore, demanded the immediate review of all provisions of the bill. “The Bill violates key principles of legislative drafting rules mandating laws to be simple, clear and unambiguous. “This leaves room for significant amount of discretion on the part of the implementing authorities and limits the rights of citizens and respective institutions to question decisions taken in the exercise of the powers provided in the Bill. “We demand a review of all provisions of the Bill that foster inter-agency conflicts and abuse of power and undermine constitutionally guaranteed rights and are contrary to the rule of law and Nigeria’s international human rights obligations.” The groups include: Girl Child Africa, Center For Liberty, Centre for Democracy and Development, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, Say No Campaign, Amnesty International, YIAGA Africa, Human and Environmental Development Agenda, Global Rights and African Centre for Media and Information Literacy. Others are International Press Centre, Lawyers Alert, Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre, Enough is Enough, Community Life Project, Centre for Information Technology and Development, Centre for Impact Advocacy, Concerned Nigerians, Lex Community NG, Education as a Vaccine, Dinidari Foundation, Albino Foundation, The Community of PWDs in Nigeria, Dorothy Njemanze Foundation, Tap Nitiative for citizens development, Raising New Voices Initiative, Haly Hope Foundation, Youths Concerns Development Foundation, Adopt A Goal For Development Initiative, Coalition in Defence of Nigerian Democracy and Constitution, PITCH Nigeria, House of Justice, Molluma Medico-Legal Centre, Albino Foundation, The Community of PWDs in Nigeria, Alliances for Africa, Youths in Motion, Persons with Disabilities Action Network, Silverchip Fox, Community Action for Popular Participation and Resource Centre for Human Rights & Civic Education. Allegations On Tuesday, Mr Gbajabiamila said the allegation that the bill is a sinister attempt to turn Nigerians into guinea pigs for medical research while taking away their fundamental human rights was far from the truth. He said as representatives of the Nigerian people, members of the House would never contemplate doing anything that would jeopardise the wellbeing of the citizens. ADVERTISEMENT He promised that a public hearing would be conducted during the consideration of the bill."
68,68,true/false,"Ice Apocalypse In a remote region of Antarctica known as Pine Island Bay, 2,500 miles from the tip of South America, two glaciers hold human civilization hostage.  Stretching across a frozen plain more than 150 miles long, these glaciers, named Pine Island and Thwaites, have marched steadily for millennia toward the Amundsen Sea, part of the vast Southern Ocean. Further inland, the glaciers widen into a two-mile-thick reserve of ice covering an area the size of Texas.  There’s no doubt this ice will melt as the world warms. The vital question is when.  The glaciers of Pine Island Bay are two of the largest and fastest-melting in Antarctica. (A Rolling Stone feature earlier this year dubbed Thwaites “The Doomsday Glacier.”) Together, they act as a plug holding back enough ice to pour 11 feet of sea-level rise into the world’s oceans — an amount that would submerge every coastal city on the planet. For that reason, finding out how fast these glaciers will collapse is one of the most important scientific questions in the world today.  To figure that out, scientists have been looking back to the end of the last ice age, about 11,000 years ago, when global temperatures stood at roughly their current levels. The bad news? There’s growing evidence that the Pine Island Bay glaciers collapsed rapidly back then, flooding the world’s coastlines — partially the result of something called “marine ice-cliff instability.”  The ocean floor gets deeper toward the center of this part of Antarctica, so each new iceberg that breaks away exposes taller and taller cliffs. Ice gets so heavy that these taller cliffs can’t support their own weight. Once they start to crumble, the destruction would be unstoppable.  “Ice is only so strong, so it will collapse if these cliffs reach a certain height,” explains Kristin Poinar, a glaciologist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. “We need to know how fast it’s going to happen.”  In the past few years, scientists have identified marine ice-cliff instability as a feedback loop that could kickstart the disintegration of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet this century — much more quickly than previously thought.  Minute-by-minute, huge skyscraper-sized shards of ice cliffs would crumble into the sea, as tall as the Statue of Liberty and as deep underwater as the height of the Empire State Building. The result: a global catastrophe the likes of which we’ve never seen.  Ice comes in many forms, with different consequences when it melts. Floating ice, like the kind that covers the Arctic Ocean in wintertime and comprises ice shelves, doesn’t raise sea levels. (Think of a melting ice cube, which won’t cause a drink to spill over.)  Land-based ice, on the other hand, is much more troublesome. When it falls into the ocean, it adds to the overall volume of liquid in the seas. Thus, sea-level rise.  Antarctica is a giant landmass — about half the size of Africa — and the ice that covers it averages more than a mile thick. Before human burning of fossil fuels triggered global warming, the continent’s ice was in relative balance: The snows in the interior of the continent roughly matched the icebergs that broke away from glaciers at its edges.  Now, as carbon dioxide traps more heat in the atmosphere and warms the planet, the scales have tipped.  A wholesale collapse of Pine Island and Thwaites would set off a catastrophe. Giant icebergs would stream away from Antarctica like a parade of frozen soldiers. All over the world, high tides would creep higher, slowly burying every shoreline on the planet, flooding coastal cities and creating hundreds of millions of climate refugees.  All this could play out in a mere 20 to 50 years — much too quickly for humanity to adapt.  “With marine ice cliff instability, sea-level rise for the next century is potentially much larger than we thought it might be five or 10 years ago,” Poinar says.  A lot of this newfound concern is driven by the research of two climatologists: Rob DeConto at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and David Pollard at Penn State University. A study they published last year was the first to incorporate the latest understanding of marine ice-cliff instability into a continent-scale model of Antarctica.  Their results drove estimates for how high the seas could rise this century sharply higher. “Antarctic model raises prospect of unstoppable ice collapse,” read the headline in the scientific journal Nature, a publication not known for hyperbole.  Instead of a three-foot increase in ocean levels by the end of the century, six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings. But if carbon emissions continue to track on something resembling a worst-case scenario, the full 11 feet of ice locked in West Antarctica might be freed up, their study showed.  Three feet of sea-level rise would be bad, leading to more frequent flooding of U.S. cities such as New Orleans, Houston, New York, and Miami. Pacific Island nations, like the Marshall Islands, would lose most of their territory. Unfortunately, it now seems like three feet is possible only under the rosiest of scenarios.  At six feet, though, around 12 million people in the United States would be displaced, and the world’s most vulnerable megacities, like Shanghai, Mumbai, and Ho Chi Minh City, could be wiped off the map.  At 11 feet, land currently inhabited by hundreds of millions of people worldwide would wind up underwater. South Florida would be largely uninhabitable; floods on the scale of Hurricane Sandy would strike twice a month in New York and New Jersey, as the tug of the moon alone would be enough to send tidewaters into homes and buildings.  DeConto and Pollard’s breakthrough came from trying to match observations of ancient sea levels at shorelines around the world with current ice sheet behavior.  Around 3 million years ago, when global temperatures were about as warm as they’re expected to be later this century, oceans were dozens of feet higher than today.  Previous models suggested that it would take hundreds or thousands of years for sea-level rise of that magnitude to occur. But once they accounted for marine ice-cliff instability, DeConto and Pollard’s model pointed toward a catastrophe if the world maintains a “business as usual” path — meaning we don’t dramatically reduce carbon emissions.  Rapid cuts in greenhouse gases, however, showed Antarctica remaining almost completely intact for hundreds of years.  Pollard and DeConto are the first to admit that their model is still crude, but its results have pushed the entire scientific community into emergency mode.  “It could happen faster or slower, I don’t think we really know yet,” says Jeremy Bassis, a leading ice sheet scientist at the University of Michigan. “But it’s within the realm of possibility, and that’s kind of a scary thing.”  Scientists used to think that ice sheets could take millennia to respond to changing climates. These are, after all, mile-thick chunks of ice.  The new evidence, though, says that once a certain temperature threshold is reached, ice shelves of glaciers that extend into the sea, like those near Pine Island Bay, will begin to melt from both above and below, weakening their structure and hastening their demise, and paving the way for ice-cliff instability to kick in.  In a new study out last month in the journal Nature, a team of scientists from Cambridge and Sweden point to evidence from thousands of scratches left by ancient icebergs on the ocean floor, indicating that Pine Island’s glaciers shattered in a relatively short amount of time at the end of the last ice age.  The only place in the world where you can see ice-cliff instability in action today is at Jakobshavn glacier in Greenland, one of the fastest-collapsing glaciers in the world. DeConto says that to construct their model, they took the collapse rate of Jakobshavn, cut it in half to be extra conservative, then applied it to Thwaites and Pine Island.  But there’s reason to think Thwaites and Pine Island could go even faster than Jakobshavn.  Right now, there’s a floating ice shelf protecting the two glaciers, helping to hold back the flow of ice into the sea. But recent examples from other regions, like the rapidly collapsing Larsen B ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula, show that once ice shelves break apart as a result of warming, their parent glaciers start to flow faster toward the sea, an effect that can weaken the stability of ice further inland, too.  “If you remove the ice shelf, there’s a potential that not just ice-cliff instabilities will start occurring, but a process called marine ice-sheet instabilities,” says Matthew Wise, a polar scientist at the University of Cambridge.  This signals the possible rapid destabilization of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet in this century. “Once the stresses exceed the strength of the ice,” Wise says, “it just falls off.”  And, it’s not just Pine Island Bay. On our current course, other glaciers around Antarctica will be similarly vulnerable. And then there’s Greenland, which could contribute as much as 20 feet of sea-level rise if it melts.  Next to a meteor strike, rapid sea-level rise from collapsing ice cliffs is one of the quickest ways our world can remake itself. This is about as fast as climate change gets.  Still, some scientists aren’t fully convinced the alarm is warranted. Ted Scambos, lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado, says the new research by Wise and his colleagues, which identified ice-cliff instabilities in Pine Island Bay 11,000 years ago, is “tantalizing evidence.” But he says that research doesn’t establish how quickly it happened.  “There’s a whole lot more to understand if we’re going to use this mechanism to predict how far Thwaites glacier and the other glaciers are going to retreat,” he says. “The question boils down to, what are the brakes on this process?”  Scambos thinks it is unlikely that Thwaites or Pine Island would collapse all at once. For one thing, if rapid collapse did happen, it would produce a pile of icebergs that could act like a temporary ice shelf, slowing down the rate of retreat.  Despite the differences of opinion, however, there’s growing agreement within the scientific community that we need to do much more to determine the risk of rapid sea-level rise. In 2015, the U.S. and U.K. governments began to plan a rare and urgent joint research program to study Thwaites glacier. Called “How much, how fast?,” the effort is set to begin early next year and run for five years.  Seeing the two governments pooling their resources is “really a sign of the importance of research like this,” NASA’s Poinar says.  Given what’s at stake, the research program at Thwaites isn’t enough, but it might be the most researchers can get. “Realistically, it’s probably all that can be done in the next five years in the current funding environment,” says Pollard.  He’s referring, of course, to the Trump administration’s disregard for science and adequate scientific funding; the White House’s 2018 budget proposal includes the first-ever cut to the National Science Foundation, which typically funds research in Antarctica.  “It would be sensible to put a huge effort into this, from my perspective,” Pollard says. Structural engineers need to study Antarctica’s key glaciers as though they were analyzing a building, he says, probing for weak spots and understanding how exactly they might fail. “If you vastly increase the research now, [the cost] would still be trivial compared to the losses that might happen.”  Bassis, the ice sheet scientist at the University of Michigan, first described the theoretical process of marine ice-cliff instability in research published only a few years ago.  He’s 40 years old, but his field has already changed enormously over the course of his career. In 2002, when Bassis was conducting his PhD research in a different region of Antarctica, he was shocked to return to his base camp and learn that the Larsen B ice shelf had vanished practically overnight.  “Every revision to our understanding has said that ice sheets can change faster than we thought,” he says. “We didn’t predict that Pine Island was going to retreat, we didn’t predict that Larsen B was going to disintegrate. We tend to look at these things after they’ve happened.”  There’s a recurring theme throughout these scientists’ findings in Antarctica: What we do now will determine how quickly Pine Island and Thwaites collapse. A fast transition away from fossil fuels in the next few decades could be enough to put off rapid sea-level rise for centuries. That’s a decision worth countless trillions of dollars and millions of lives.  “The range of outcomes,” Bassis says, “is really going to depend on choices that people make.”  Reporting like this is only possible thanks to the generous support of readers like you.

69,69,true/false,"England delays full lifting of virus restrictions Last week Johnson gave his strongest hint yet that the final stage of easing restrictions, originally set for June 21, might be delayed  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday announced a four-week delay to the full lifting of coronavirus restrictions in England due to a surge in infections caused by the Delta variant.  The delay comes as a blow to Johnson's plans to fully reopen the UK economy on June 21 after months of gradually easing restrictions since March.  Newspapers had been counting down to what had been dubbed ""Freedom Day"", which was set to mark an end to all social distancing restrictions and the reopening of nightclubs.  But Johnson said a sharp rise in infections had prompted a decision to ""ease off the accelerator"" and focus instead on ramping up vaccinations.  ""On the evidence I can see right now, I'm confident that we will not need more than four weeks and won't need to go beyond July 19,"" Johnson told a press briefing.  Health policy is devolved in the four nations that make up the UK, handled separately in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Scotland, which was due to move to the lowest level of restrictions on June 28, is also expected to announce a delay to its reopening.  In England, most current rules -- including limits on the number of people who can meet in pubs and restaurants -- will remain in place until July 19, although restrictions on the number of guests allowed at weddings will be lifted.  Large scale pilot events, such as Euro 2020 football matches, will also go ahead as planned.  The more transmissible Delta variant, first identified in India, is now responsible for 96 percent of UK cases, and positive tests have jumped 50 percent in the last week.  Total reported cases are now at their highest since February -- around 8,000 new infections a day.  The Delta variant is believed to be around 60 percent more transmissible than the Alpha variant first identified in Kent, southeast England.  That strain forced the country to go into another three-month lockdown in January.  Nevertheless hospital admissions and deaths remain low, thanks in large part to Britain's rapid vaccination rollout.  Story continues  More than 55 percent of adults in the UK have had two vaccine jabs.  - Vaccine boost -  Newspapers have hinted at dissent within Johnson's cabinet over the delay, with The Times citing an unnamed minister as saying it was ""a very odd decision"".  Johnson accepted that ""we cannot simply eliminate Covid, we must learn to live with it,"" but added that ""once the adults of this country have been overwhelmingly vaccinated... we will be in a far stronger position to... live with this disease"".  The government hopes that two thirds of all adults will have received two shots by July 19.  A study released Monday found that two jabs of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine stopped the need for in-patient treatment in 96 percent of cases of the new variant.  With a double dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca shot, the rate was 92 percent.  The government had hoped to allow crowds to return unrestricted to pubs and clubs next week, with the hard-hit hospitality industry warning it is on its last legs.  Trade association UKHospitality estimated that a month's delay in lifting the restrictions would cost the sector around £3 billion ($4.23 billion) in sales.  ""A full and final ending of restrictions is the only way to ensure that businesses in this sector can trade profitably,"" said its chief executive Kate Nicholls.  imm-am/jwp/kjl"

71,71,true/false,"Outrage as Britain’s Windrush immigrants are SNUBBED at this week’s Commonwealth summit An overwhelming majority of the public would support renationalising the railways amid cancellations, delays and complaints of poor service from private rail operators, a new poll reveals. The exclusive survey for The Independent also found nearly six out of 10 people think that the privatisation of Britain’s railways has been a failure. Pressure has been mounting on transport secretary Chris Grayling as thousands of commuters faced weeks of cancellations and delays, after sweeping timetable changes were brought in by Govia Thameslink Rail GTR and Northern Rail. Theresa May branded the disruption “unacceptable” when she discussed the issue with her cabinet last week, increasing pressure on the transport secretary. It also comes after the East Coast mainline was taken back under public control, as the troubled franchise agreement between Virgin Trains and Stagecoach had to be scrapped. The BMG Research poll, which was conducted amid widespread rail chaos last week, found 64 per cent of voters would support bringing the railways back into public ownership, while just 19 per cent of people would oppose it. And 56 per cent branded the privatisation of the railways a failure, with only 15 per cent of people saying it had been a success.

Read our privacy notice The poll found a major appetite for tougher sanctions against private rail firms, with 80 per cent backing the prospect of major fines and only 9 per cent opposing it. Some 64 per cent believe the government has not properly held private firms to account over the quality of service they offer to the public, while only 20 per cent think rail companies have been reasonably scrutinised by ministers. More than 15,000 trains have been cancelled or delayed since the timetable changes came into force in May, with some passengers complaining they were at risk of losing their jobs. GTR was even forced to put on taxis to help teenagers get to school to sit their GCSEs in parts of Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire. Last week, Mr Grayling laid the blame for the disruption with rail firms, telling MPs: “The huge growth in passenger numbers in recent years demanded expanded routes, services and extra seats, but this timetable change has resulted instead in unacceptable disruption for the passengers who rely on these services.” He added: “I am clear about the fact that the industry must and will be held to account for this, but my immediate priority is to ensure that we improve train services to an acceptable level as quickly as possible, and that will remain my priority.” However,shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: “He might want to blame Network Rail, but it is he who has failed in his responsibility to oversee it; the buck stops with him. “What is more, he has burnt his bridges with the leadership of Network Rail, which can only have damaged his oversight of this process.

72,72,true/false,"Top Pentagon nominee pushed conspiracy theories that former CIA director tried to overthrow Trump and even have him assassinated (CNN) The White House's nominee for a top Pentagon post repeatedly spread conspiracy theories that a former CIA director tried to overthrow President Donald Trump and even have him assassinated in newly discovered comments from radio and television appearances as well as on social media.  Retired Army Brig. Gen. Anthony Tata, who was nominated to become the under secretary of defense for policy at the Department of Defense, promoted conspiracy theories that John Brennan, the former CIA director, wanted to oust Trump from office, and pushed a bogus conspiracy theory that Brennan sent a coded tweet to order the assassination of Trump in 2018.  A spokesperson for Brennan declined to comment.  CNN's KFile reviewed dozens of Tata's radio and television appearances and found that he also spread conspiracy theories that a ""deep state cabal"" of officials would rather see Trump fail than succeed in office, a sentiment echoed by the President and his allies, using extreme rhetoric. Tata also said then-President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama engaged in ""borderline treasonous"" behavior by expressing their dismay over a Trump presidency during the transition period.  The retired general's nomination to the third-highest position at the Pentagon faces jeopardy after Democratic senators spoke out against his nomination following CNN's KFile reporting last week on Tata's history of Islamophobia and derogatory comments and tweets, including falsely calling Obama a Muslim and ""terrorist leader."" At least two high-profile retired generals have pulled their support for Tata since his tweets were reported. Tata has since deleted dozens of his tweets, screenshots of which were captured by CNN.  CNN obtained a letter Tata sent to the top members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Republican Chairman Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma and Democrat Jack Reed of Rhode Island, both of whom oversee his nomination, apologizing for his past Islamophobic tweets. He wrote, ""I deeply regret comments I made on social media several years ago"" and that ""my tweets were completely out of character.""  ""My regret, however, has nothing to do with my nomination for Undersecretary of Defense of Policy. Rather, I have a lifetime of public service leadership and a cadre of soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and civilian mentors and protégés whom I disappointed with those comments,"" Tata added in his letter, first reported on Saturday by The Hill  If confirmed by the Senate, Tata would oversee the Pentagon's policy on everything from Afghanistan, China, Iran and Russia to nuclear deterrence and missile defense policy. He would also closely advise the secretary of defense on national security and support the Pentagon's program and budget decisions.  Tata's nomination comes as the White House seeks to install loyalists to key positions throughout the administration. His newly surfaced comments appear to mimic what the President and his allies have long maintained -- that the ""deep state"" has sought to undermine Trump's presidency and that his opponents would rather see the country fail than see him succeed -- without citing specific evidence.  The retired general also said that Obama's foreign policy ""was born of the Jeremiah Wright school of hate America"" and that the former president held a ""Weather Underground"" philosophy, referring respectively to the Obamas' former pastor and to the FBI-designated domestic terrorist group born out of anti-war sentiments that bombed dozens of buildings and government institutions in the 1960s and 1970s.  The Pentagon referred CNN to the White House for comment. The White House stood by Tata and referred CNN to a previous statement defending the nominee from last week  ""Anthony Tata, the President's exceptionally qualified nominee for Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, is a distinguished public servant whose career has provided him with planning, policy, and operational experience both at home and abroad,"" White House spokesman Judd Deere told CNN in an email. ""His education, background, and record has earned him bi-partisan praise, and this attempt by the media to slander his reputation is disgusting. The White House stands by the President's qualified nominee.""  Tata did not respond for comment but, a source familiar with the discussions regarding Tata's nomination told CNN that Tata is ""pleased with the support he's receiving from the White House and DOD teams and hopes to speak members of both parties as soon as possible.""  ""He intends to convey in person or by phone his sincere regret for his past comments and hopes to discuss the serious policy concerns the US faces today,"" the source said.  A US defense official confirmed that Tata still works as a senior adviser in the Pentagon.  Tata spread conspiracy theories that officials were trying to overthrow and assassinate Trump  Tata asserted a number of conspiracy theories in his radio and television appearances and on social media. In several media appearances, Tata attacked Brennan, the former director of the CIA in the Obama administration, as a ""former communist"" who ""manipulated ISIS intelligence"" for Obama on a 2016 podcast  After Trump revoked Brennan's security clearance in August 2018, Tata told Fox News , ""I think that John Brennan is a clear and present danger and a threat to this nation. He supports the overthrow of this particular president and he needed to have his access to information revoked.""  ""It would not surprise me if eventually it came out that he was somehow allied with some foreign power because what he's doing is fomenting the division. You look at his tweets, you look at what he says, and he is doing Putin's bidding every day on Twitter. He is dividing this nation and he's trying to ossify the left against the right,"" said Tata.  Tata went further in a May 2018 tweet when he pushed a conspiracy theory of his own by claiming that Brennan used a coded tweet to order the assassination of Trump. After Brennan tweeted a Cicero quote, Tata replied, ""As incompetent as @JohnBrennan was as a #CIA analyst (failure at Khobar Towers), we must assume he knows spy tradecraft. This is a signal to someone, somewhere. Cicero was assassinated for political reasons. This is a clear threat against @POTUS.""  When a Twitter user challenged if Tata was serious about his accusation, Tata replied , ""Totally. He's nervous. He ran the CIA. He's committed multiple crimes. He has the network to do what he threatens here.""  The Twitter user then asked the retired general if Brennan's tweet was a signal to someone to assassinate the President. Tata wrote back , ""I believe so. Why else would he randomly quote Cicero on a day that @realDonaldTrump asks for an investigation of crimes that directly implicates him? Serious crimes: treason, sedition. He's a cowardly bureaucrat that lucked into a powerful psn. He doesn't have the spine for this.""  In a now deleted tweet, Tata also used the hashtag ""Clinton Body Count"" to refer to the conspiracy that former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have ordered the assassinations of their associates, and wrote that he hoped former FBI lawyer Lisa Page did not meet an ""untimely demise.""  Tata also accused the Obamas of engaging in ""borderline treasonous"" behavior during the presidential transition period from Obama to Trump after they expressed dismay at a Trump presidency.  ""So when you see President Obama on Comedy Central, digging on the President-elect, making fun of him and talking about Russia. And you hear Michelle Obama on the Oprah show saying for the first time in her life, she's felt no hope--that is unconscionable. That is, that is a borderline treasonous to be undermining the term, a peaceful transition of power,"" said Tata on a December 2016 podcast  He also claimed Obama was an insurgent who tried to undermine and overthrow American life in another broadcast from December 2016.  ""He had the Jeremiah Wright philosophy. He had the Weather Underground philosophy. And so he had all the insurgent philosophy of how to undermine American values and American way of life and American foreign policy, which he is effectively done,"" Tata said, referring to the Weather Underground Organization, a radical militant group responsible for bombings and other acts of political violence in the 1960s and 1970s. The FBI designated the organization as a domestic terrorist organization.  Tata also maintained that opponents of Trump would rather see the President fail than succeed, often using extreme rhetoric. In 2018 Tata said , ""I believe in my soul that Hillary Clinton and others would prefer to see a nuclear cloud over America than to see Donald Trump succeed. I mean that 100%.""  ""That we are so divided right now that the left wants to, would rather see the country burned down, than to have this President succeed,"" he added."
73,73,true/false,"Vaccines highly effective against hospitalisation from Delta variant The analysis suggests:  the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is 96% effective against hospitalisation after 2 doses  the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is 92% effective against hospitalisation after 2 doses  These are comparable with vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation from the Alpha variant.  Further work remains underway to establish the level of protection against mortality from the Delta variant. However, as with other variants, this is expected to be high.  The analysis included 14,019 cases of the Delta variant – 166 of whom were hospitalised – between 12 April and 4 June, looking at emergency hospital admissions in England.  Public Health England ( PHE ) has previously published analysis showing that one dose is 17% less effective at preventing symptomatic illness from the Delta variant, compared to Alpha, but there is only a small difference after 2 doses.  Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock said:  Our UK vaccination programme continues at pace and has already saved thousands of lives. It is our way out of this pandemic. This evidence of the effectiveness of 2 doses against variants shows just how crucial it is to get your second jab. If you have had your first dose but haven’t booked your second yet – please do so. It will help save lives and boost us on the road to recovery.  Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at PHE , said:  These hugely important findings confirm that the vaccines offer significant protection against hospitalisation from the Delta variant. The vaccines are the most important tool we have against COVID-19. Thousands of lives have already been saved because of them. It is absolutely vital to get both doses as soon as they are offered to you, to gain maximum protection against all existing and emerging variants.  Vaccines Minister, Nadhim Zahawi said:  It is extremely encouraging to see today’s research showing that vaccines are continuing to help break the link between hospitalisation and the Delta variant after one dose, and particularly the high effectiveness of 2 doses. If you’re getting the call to bring forward your second dose appointment – do not delay – get the second jab so you can benefit from the fullest possible protection."

75,75,true/false,"Number of women to lose their unborn child after having the Covid Vaccine increases by 366% in just six weeks Losing a new born is a heart breaking endeavour, as is the pain of losing an unborn child. Which is why we’re both saddened and shocked to bring you the latest update on the number of unborn and newborn children to lose their lives as a result of the mothers receiving one of the Covid-19 vaccines in the United Kingdom. The Government have released weekly reports on adverse reactions to the experimental Covid-19 vaccines, the first of which covered data inputted to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme from the 9th December 2020 through to the 24th January 2021. Their latest report (find it here), which is the seventh to be released covers data inputted to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme from the 9th December 2020 though to the 7th March 2021. Just six weeks separate the first and seventh report, and the shocking increase in the number of women losing their unborn and newborn child in that time due to having either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is appalling. This was the Governments own advice upon emergency approval of the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine –Pregnancy’ There are no or limited amount of data from the use of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2. Animal reproductive toxicity studies have not been completed. COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is not recommended during pregnancy. For women of childbearing age, pregnancy should be excluded before vaccination. In addition, women of childbearing age should be advised to avoid pregnancy for at least 2 months after their second dose. We told you about this back in December, as the Governments own advice also included comments on breast-feeding and fertility which were as follows – Breast-feeding It is unknown whether COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 should not be used during breast-feeding. Fertility It is unknown whether COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 has an impact on fertility.’ It is because of this advice released by the UK Government that we were so shocked to see in the first released report of adverse reactions to the Covid vaccines, using data inputted to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme up to the 24th January 2021 a total of 4 women had suffered a miscarriage as a result of having the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. As well as a total of 2 women losing their unborn child as result of having the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.We’re still unable to answer why these women were given one of the Covid vaccines against the Governments own advice. But what’s truly shocking is how much this number has increased in the 6 weeks that have unfolded since.
According to the seventh report released by the UK Government on adverse reactions to the Covid vaccines, using data inputted to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme up to the 7th March 2021, there has been a 475% increase since the 24th January in the number of women who have lost their unborn child after having the Pfizer vaccine, bringing the total to 23. This is devastating.
Sadly there is also now 1 report of a premature baby sadly dying after the mother had the Pfizer vaccine.The AstraZeneca jab has also caused unnecessary pain to expectant mothers. As of the 7th March there has been a 150% increase since the 24th January in the number of women to suffer a miscarriage, bringing the total to 5. Tragically there has also been 1 still birth reported to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme after the mother had the AstraZeneca vaccine, but shockingly this has not been labelled as a fatality. The question is why are we seeing these numbers when the Governments own advice was that pregnant women should not have the vaccine?
Well we started digging and found that the Government has since updated it’s original advice to the following –
4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There is limited experience with use of the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 in pregnant women.
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy,
embryo/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development. Administration of
the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential
benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus.
This is criminal! We dread to think what sort of numbers of these events we will see in the weeks to come.
Informed consent is important, we don’t believe these women were informed in the slightest, and now they will have to suffer the eternal pain of losing their unborn or newborn child."

Сообщения о русском следе в происхождении так называемого ""гаванского синдрома"" у сотрудников диппредставительств США являются ""фейками русофобского агитпропа"" и выдумками за гранью здравого смысла, заявил заместитель директора Департамента информации и печати МИД РФ Александр Бикантов.Он напомнил, что недавно о симптомах ""гаванского синдрома"" сообщили сотрудники посольства США в Австрии, которые якобы жалуются на постоянные головные боли, головокружения и неспособность концентрироваться. Началось все в 2016 году с жалоб американских дипломатов в Гаване, к которым затем добавились их коллеги из посольства Канады на Кубе.""Правда, канадцы вскоре отыграли назад, когда по итогам совместного с кубинцами расследования выяснилось, что виноваты карибские цикады и применявшиеся для борьбы с комарами фумигаторы"", - напомнил Бикантов.При этом в Вашингтоне ""с упорством, достойным лучшего применения, продолжают передавать СМИ дутые сенсации о ""русском следе"" в злонамеренных действиях на голову своих дипломатов с помощью звуковых, радио- и энергетических волн"".Он посетовал также, что ""любовь западной бульварной прессы к конспирологии неискоренима"".""Советовали бы качественным медиа избегать этого зыбкого поля. Иначе в следующий раз русских придется обвинять в солнечных затмениях или снегопадах. Пределам таким нездоровым фантазиям нет. И мы видим, они будут еще, если за них берутся вашингтонские пропагандисты"", - добавил он.Так называемый ""гаванский синдром"" наблюдался среди дипломатов США на Кубе в 2016 и 2017 годах, а также в КНР в 2018 году. Дипломаты, предположительно, подверглись звуковому воздействию, которое привело к долговременным последствиям для здоровья. Периодически в прессе в США звучали обвинения в адрес России в организации ""акустических атак"", МИД РФ назвал эти обвинения ""полным абсурдом и странными инсинуациями"". Ранее в четверг директор ЦРУ Уильям Бернс заявил, что за необъяснимыми эпизодами ухудшения состояния американских дипломатов может стоять Россия, но сделать сколько-нибудь определенные выводы не позволяет нехватка данных.Случаи недомогания, похожие на ""гаванский синдром"", также, по данным СМИ, были зафиксированы у американских представителей в Африке, Таджикистане и Москве. Последний известный случай необъяснимых недомоганий среди американских дипломатов произошел в Вене. В общей сложности, по данным главы ЦРУ, во всех инцидентах пострадали несколько сотен американских дипломатов, разведчиков и военных, как сообщает CNN, около сотни из них были сотрудниками ЦРУ.  https://ria.ru/20210802/eskalatsiya-1743954495.html  https://ria.ru/20210726/zakharova-1743003934.html  https://ria.ru/20210712/krazha-1740918941.html  вена  африка  россия  РИА Новости 1 5 4.7 96 internet-group@rian.ru 7 495 645-6601 ФГУП МИА «Россия сегодня» https://xn--c1acbl2abdlkab1og.xn--p1ai/awards/ 353 60 353 60  2021  РИА Новости 1 5 4.7 96 internet-group@rian.ru 7 495 645-6601 ФГУП МИА «Россия сегодня» https://xn--c1acbl2abdlkab1og.xn--p1ai/awards/ 353 60 353 60  Новости  ru-RU  https://ria.ru/docs/about/copyright.html  https://xn--c1acbl2abdlkab1og.xn--p1ai/  РИА Новости 1 5 4.7 96 internet-group@rian.ru 7 495 645-6601 ФГУП МИА «Россия сегодня» https://xn--c1acbl2abdlkab1og.xn--p1ai/awards/ 353 60 353 60  1920 1080 true  1920 1440 true  1920 1920 true  РИА Новости 1 5 4.7 96 internet-group@rian.ru 7 495 645-6601 ФГУП МИА «Россия сегодня» https://xn--c1acbl2abdlkab1og.xn--p1ai/awards/ 353 60 353 60  РИА Новости 1 5 4.7 96 internet-group@rian.ru 7 495 645-6601 ФГУП МИА «Россия сегодня» https://xn--c1acbl2abdlkab1og.xn--p1ai/awards/ 353 60 353 60  вена, африка, министерство иностранных дел российской федерации (мид рф), уильям бернс, россия"
77,77,true/false,"Fully vaccinated people have a 885% higher chance of death due to Covid-19 than people who are unvaccinated according to official data The Delta Covid-19 variant is currently rampant in the United Kingdom according to official data which has been released by Public Health England (PHE) in an attempt to justify the continuation of draconian restrictions on the lives of the British people.  However, we wonder if they realise that the very same data PHE released shows us that people who have received two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine have an 885% higher chance of dying of Covid-19 than of those who are unvaccinated?  The PHE report which can be viewed here shows that between the 1st February 2021 and the 21st June 2021 a total of 92,029 confirmed cases of the Delta variant had been confirmed.  Of these 58.4% were people who had not been vaccinated, totalling 53,822.  A further 7.8% were people who had received both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, totalling 7,235.  A further 14.9% were people who had received one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine at least three weeks prior to testing positive for the Delta Covid variant, totalling 13,715.  And a further 6.78% were people who had received one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine less than three weeks prior to testing positive for the Delta Covid variant, totalling 6,242.  As per the above table taken from the Public Health England report we can see that the number of positive cases of the Delta variant in people who are unvaccinated outnumber the number of positive cases of the Delta variant in people who are fully vaccinated by around 7.4 to 1.  This difference probably gives you the impression that the Covid-19 jabs are working fantastically? Well don’t get too excited.  Because if we take the number of people who have had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine – 27,192, we can see that the number of people who are unvaccinated, who have tested positive for the Delta variant only outnumber people who have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine by around 1.97 to 1.  They don’t seem so fantastic now do they?  But how do have these alleged confirmed cases of the alleged Delta Covid-19 variant translated into hospitalisations? Well thankfully Public Health England tell us within their report.  As per the above table we can see that of the 53,822 confirmed cases of the Delta Covid variant in people who were unvaccinated, 831 presented to emergency care which resulted in overnight inpatient admission. This accounts for 1.54% of the confirmed cases in people who are unvaccinated.  However, of the 7,235 confirmed cases of the Delta variant in people who are fully vaccinated people, 190 presented to emergency care which resulted in overnight inpatient admission. This accounts for 2.6% of the confirmed cases in people who are fully vaccinated.  This data, which has been published by Public Health England, shows us that people who have received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have a 70.1% higher chance of being hospitalised with the alleged Delta Covid variant than people who are unvaccinated.  None of the Covid-19 vaccines have been proven to prevent infection or prevent the spread of the alleged Covid-19 virus. Instead they have allegedly been proven to reduce the risk of hospitalisation and death, but even then the study carried out is highly questionable.  It doesn’t look like the Covid-19 vaccines are doing what they say on the tin, does it? Perhaps they’re doing their job at reducing the risk of death, thankfully Public Health England have provided the data for us to find out.  As per the above table we can see that of the 53,822 confirmed cases of the Delta Covid variant in people who are unvaccinated, 44 have sadly died. This accounts to 0.07% of confirmed cases in the people who are unvaccinated.  However, of the 7,235 confirmed cases of the Delta Covid variant in people who had received both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine and were therefore fully vaccinated, 50 have sadly died. This accounts to 0.69% of confirmed cases in people who are fully vaccinated.  This data, which again has been published by Public Health England, shows us that people who have received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have a 885.7% higher chance of dying due to the Delta Covid variant than people who are unvaccinated.  Now that definitely isn’t what the Covid-19 vaccines said they would do on the tin.  Is this evidence of antibody-dependent enhancement? One senior researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory – Stephanie Seneff, seems to think so.  ADE blighted previous attempts at coronavirus vaccines and frequently resulted in enhanced lung disease among vaccinated lab animals. It led researchers in 2012 to advise scientists to proceed with “caution” for any human coronavirus vaccines which could lead to enhanced lung disease.  Seneff said research has shown that coronavirus vaccines alter the ways immune systems respond to infection and can activate other sleeping infections in the vaccinated person.  “It is conceivable to me that the laser-beam specificity of the induced antibodies is offset by a general weakening of innate immunity,” Seneff said.  “I also suspect that massive vaccination campaigns may accelerate the rate at which the vaccine-resistant mutant strains become dominant among all the SARS-CoV-2 strains.”  Considering the fact 45 million people have had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine in the United Kingdom at the time of writing, it looks like we’re in for one hell of a winter crisis."
78,78,true/false,"Ocasio-Cortez Proposes Bill Capping Legal Voting Age at 65 The Democrats in Congress just never seem to be satisfied. After the months of phony “impeachment” nonsense they put us all through, paid for by dipping into our social security funding, no less, now they’re dead set to cheat their way through the 2020 election. And who better to lead the crooked bandwagon than Little Sally Socialism herself, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.  Cortez is the author of congressional bill OU812 which would place an upper age-limit on legal voting within the United States to 65. After that age, no citizen would be able to register or even visit a local polling place, and all people currently above that mark would be permanently struck from the rolls immediately. The bill is gaining momentum in the Congress and is likely to pass, and with several Republicans in the Senate already beginning to turn against the conservative movement, it stands a good chance of becoming law. Cortez explained the reasoning behind the bill to a crowd gathered outside of her local nail-art emporium in Blumpkinville, New York:  “So, it’s like, old people – a lot of them get kind of dopey, you know? In their minds? They get Demen-entia. Or that really terrible one, Wisenheimer’s. And then they can’t make decisions very well. That’s why we end up with a professional con man like Trump, right? And then we have to go through all this trouble to impeach him and throw him out and fix their mistake, and it’s not fair. So I figure it could be eliminated altogether if we just stop them from voting stupid. They wont know. We can like, send them little pieces of paper, and they can write ‘Trump’ on them and we can just pat their heads and tell them we’ll put it in the voting car and it’ll drive it to the voting house or whatever. They won’t know the difference. Everyone happy. Okay, I have to go because I heard the new line of Hot Emoticon nail art is out and it’s SOOO delish.”  Experts agree that if the bill passes fairly soon, it will nearly destroy President Trump’s voting base and chances for re-election. But then again, experts also agreed that Killery was going to win in 2016, isn’t that right patriots? And you know, she basically did, but only for the grace of the electoral college, designed exactly for that reason by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Himself. We can only hope and pray that should this bill see the light of day, God will find another way to give America the mentally handicapped President she deserves.  Share this:"
79,79,true/false,"I am one of millions who have chosen not to have a Covid vaccine. Does that mean I’m to be banned from planes, buildings & shops? By Jani Allan , a writer and talk show host. She has written for the London Sunday Times, the Spectator, the Daily Mail and various other British publications. Her memoir Jani Confidential was published by Jacana Media.  The mainstream media and the medical orthodoxy is adamant that everyone needs to get the jab – or face exclusion from everyday freedoms and be shunned from society. Don’t they realise how fascistic this view is?  This is not an anti-vaccine rant. It is a sober discussion of the matter of civil liberties.  Since March 2020, we have been forced to wear masks.  The mask is a crucifix. It signals to society that you are a believer. (In Covid-19.) It tells society that you are compliant and have submitted.  Like taking the knee, it is virtue signalling. It says you are happy with the lockdowns because, hey, you don’t have to go to work and you still get a ‘stimmy’ cheque. The single most effective way of breaking down a human being is social isolation and distancing. Irreparable harm is being done to children, especially, by enforced mask wearing.  Also on rt.com WHO gives emergency approval to China's Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine, sixth jab to be backed by UN agency  In any free society, we should be able to ask questions and make our own choices about receiving medical treatment, or not. But anyone who asks questions is automatically branded “anti-science”. The notion that there is just one scientific doctrine to follow is actually anti-scientific in itself. And that’s not just my view, but that of scientists.  The notion that freedom of speech still exists in America today is a nonsense. Those that dare question the efficacy of the smorgasbord of vaccinations are cancelled and shamed. They are dehumanized and ‘othered.’  The First Amendment to the United States Constitution prevents the government from making laws which regulate an establishment of religion, prohibit the free exercise of religion, or abridge the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, the right to peaceably assemble, or the right to petition the government for redress of grievances. It was adopted on December 15, 1791, as one of the ten amendments that constitute the Bill of Rights.  The premise of the First Amendment is unique. Allowing freedom of speech means allowing someone who disagrees with you the right to voice their opinion, however offensive it might be.  It is precisely this freedom of speech that made America great. Be prepared to be offended. How tragic that the press are now the government lapdogs. “The View”, a daily talk show on ABC, is just one of many outlets that seek to humiliate and shame those who are not following the approved Covid narrative. For the last couple of weeks, I have watched its presenter, Sunny Hostin, insult Americans whom she brands the ‘vaccine hesitant.’  Here’s her take on life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness in 2021 America: “When you look at the folks that are not getting vaccinated because it’s a quarter of Americans that are not getting vaccinated, white evangelicals, 45% said they won’t get vaccinated… Republicans, almost 50% are refusing to get the vaccine. We won’t reach herd immunity because of those particular groups.  “I say we need to shun those that refuse to get vaccinated. Just like now in certain states... there are signs on storefronts on businesses.. [stating] no mask, no entry. I think if you have not been vaccinated, no entry. You want to get on a plane? You have to be vaccinated. … You don’t get the liberties that come with immunity. Something has to break. If that’s your personal choice not to get vaccinated, you don’t then get to infringe on the rights of those who have chosen to protect their fellow citizens.”  Also on rt.com WHO asks Big Pharma for more transparent vaccine data with fewer redactions to boost ‘public trust’ & scientific ‘integrity’  And, of course, all these glossy women in the mainstream media, with their big, strong teeth, concur that Donald Trump must be banned from every platform and be punished for his alleged mishandling of the virus.  “So many people hang on his every word. He is still a public safety threat,” Hostin explains. “He can harm public safety and harm this country. He is too much of a danger. He doesn’t need to contaminate the airwaves.”  This subjectivity of censorship is why the cure is worse than the illness.  We live in a post-truth world whose emblem is stupefying hypocrisy. The leftists view on abortion is: “My body, my choice.” However, the leftists’ view on vaccines is: “Your body, my choice.”  The consensus of these people – and they are to be found on every other mainstream channel and newspaper, not just ABC – is that they don’t want unvaccinated people around them. Unvaccinated people are the unclean and should be punished. They shouldn’t be allowed to take their children to schools, go to restaurants, take cruises or even walk in the park. Don’t you dare come near me without a vaccine.  Does that mean I am to be banned from planes, shops and offices, as Hostin advocates?  Can the state compel you to take a vaccine with the reward of everyday freedoms? Technically, no. Roe v. Wade decided that no one can be discriminated against based on an aspect of their medical history, so unless the US Supreme Court overrules that case, vaccine and vaccine passports are in fact unconstitutional and illegal.  The Texas pediatrician Peter Hotez, backed by Bill Gates, wrote in Nature magazine recently. Hotez claims there is “anti-vax aggression” and he equates anti-vaxxers with cybercriminals and nuclear terrorists. He wants the United Nations to establish shock troops to hunt down and eliminate them.  Last time I looked, the groups that are actually committing violence are BLM and Antifa. But they are never called to account. The mainstream media now effectively designates anti-vaxxers as terrorists. Vaccine sceptics are the dangers and risks to society, while BLM and Antifa are the good guys.  The latest attack on the bone-headed populace – aka, those that haven’t been vaccinated – by Hostin and her fellow travellers is chilling.  Even her co-presenter Whoopi Goldberg was a little taken back: “Requiring proof that one has been vaccinated in order to travel – is this crazy?”  Hostin was unmoved: “It’s not a radical idea, the vaccine is solid.”  “At what time do we give up on these boneheads?” another host, Joy Behar, demanded. “You have to have proof of vaccination. Everyone must be inconvenienced. You don’t get to certain events. This is not a political issue.”  Behar, Hostin et al. obviously concur with the Michigan Governor, Gretchen Witmer, who has made her entire state hostage to being vaccinated. Get the jab or suffer gunpoint-enforced lockdowns: they won’t end until 70% of the state’s adults surrender to being injected.  This is fascistic coercion that violates restrictions against medical experiments, violates fundamental human rights and the requirement for informed consent. Surely such tactics should never be deployed or tolerated in a free society?  Are we who choose to stay vaccine-free, who declare we have sovereign rights over our own bodies, to be publicly singled out, excluded and punished? After the Nuremberg Race Laws were passed in Germany in 1935, Jews were ostracised, discriminated against, and later had to wear a yellow badge so as to make ‘the enemy within visible.'  Also on rt.com Billionaires like Bill Gates won’t save us from Covid, or fix fake news or the climate crisis. Because it’s not in their interests  Are those of us in the 21st century unable to provide proof of being vaccinated against Covid, going to suffer a similar fate? (And, just to be clear, I am not making any comparisons to the later, heinous genocide that occured, but simply to how a majority can go down the road of singling out and discriminating against a minority).  Today’s mainstream media seems intent on creating a two-tier society: the virtuous vaccinated and the unclean unvaccinated. Covid apartheid, anyone?  Like this story? Share it with a friend!"
80,80,true/false,"IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS FORT WORTH DIVISION FEDERAL DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM IN RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS’ APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION MOSCOW, December 21. /TASS/. The US administration has invested too much money into the coup in Ukraine and now has to babysit Ukrainian leader Pyotr Poroshenko despite his weak electoral positions, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday night. Regretfully, Washington is forced to babysit Poroshenko, even despite his relatively weak electoral positions, the Kremlin official said. Too much money was invested into Ukraine, too much money was poured into the coup in Ukraine, and justifying this coup also requires too much money. Peskov suggested that the United States expect its investment to somehow pay for itself, to yield some dividends. Apparently, they [the United States] did not quite succeed and now need to do their best to save the situation, he said. According to Peskov, the Russian-Ukrainian relations were further strained by the upcoming presidential elections in Ukraine. At the moment, President Poroshenko has to win electoral support by all means, because the approval of him is low compared to the rivals who have overtaken him in the electoral rating. And this is exactly what he is doing, and this is clearly visible to us all, the Kremlin spokesman said. The most dangerous thing in this situation is that President Poroshenko himself would seek to further escalate the situation and use it for electoral gain, he said, adding that Washington will have no other choice, but to support Poroshenko. Washington has to support Poroshenko and turn a blind eye to the real situation, which is exactly what it is doing now, he said. We have no doubt that this approach would continue. Speaking about the development of Russian-US relations, the Kremlin spokesman described them as a victim of the provocation made by the Ukrainian side near Kerch. However, when asked whether the Ukrainian leader’s actions may trigger international pressure on Russia that would force Moscow to act to the detriment of its own national interests, Peskov replied: The answer is categorical: no. And President Putin has said that many times.."

Both Moscow and Damascus have accused the group of helping to stage a chemical attack in the Eastern Ghouta town of Douma on April 7. According to Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, participation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR in the evacuation of the White Helmets from Syria was a big mistake. We noted the participation of the United Nations Office UNO in the evacuation of the White Helmets, the UNO confirmed their involvement in these events.

According to previous reports, up to 800 White Helmets and their family members were evacuated from Syria by Israeli authorities at the request of Canada, European countries and the US in July due to an offensive by the Syrian army against rebel militants in the southern part of the country. Damascus slammed that action, calling it a criminal operation. The organization has claimed its fundamental aim is to rescue civilians in war zones, however, it has been accused of establishing links to jihadists and helping them to fight the Syrian government.

85,85,true/false,"Tapping private resources for public university good: Guest opinion The worst murderers should be given a chance to escape staying in prison for life by pleading guilty, according to new rules drawn up for judges The worst murderers should be given a chance to escape staying in prison for life by pleading guilty, according to new rules drawn up for judges. The say a judge should take a killer's confession to the court into account when deciding whether they should be kept behind bars for good with a whole-life term. The proposal by the Sentencing Council, the body led by judges which instructs judges and magistrates on the punishments they should hand down, allows the possibility of eventual freedom to even the most evil murderers if they admit their guilt at the earliest opportunity. Critics warned yesterday that if the new sentencing rule goes into effect it could act as encouragement to murderers. Criminologist Dr David Green of the Civitas think tank, a former Home Office adviser on crime statistics, said: 'If someone knows they could get a lighter sentence if they own up, that could make them more inclined to kill.' The new murder sentencing rule is contained in a consultation document published by the Council, which lays down guidelines for judges and magistrates which they must follow unless they believe it would be unjust to do so. The paper suggests new guidance for the courts on what leniency should be shown to criminals who plead guilty. Murder sentences have been regarded as different from those imposed for all other crimes ever since the abolition of the death penalty in 1965. Those convicted of murder are always given a life sentence, but the judge also sets a real term of years that the killer will be made to serve in prison before release. The Sentencing Council said last year that 56 murderers were serving whole-life terms, which mean that they will never leave prison. These include Levi Bellfield, killer of Milly Dowler and two other women; alongside other serial murderers Peter Sutcliffe, Ian Brady, Dennis Nilson and Rosemary West. The new proposal, which will now go through a three-month consultation process before the Council decides whether to put it into effect, says that 'a court should consider the fact that an offender has pleaded guilty to murder when deciding whether it is appropriate to order a whole life term.' The paper said this is one of 'some differences' from the existing murder sentencing rules, set down by the Council's predecessor body, the Sentencing Guidelines Council, in 2007. Different guidance on whole life terms for murderers, it said, is included to reflect a 2005 Court of Appeal decision on murder sentencing. Under the new proposal, the paper said, 'the draft guideline explicitly states that the fact that an offender has pleaded guilty may be taken into account in deciding whether it is appropriate to order a whole life term.' It added that 'murder is the most serious criminal offence and the sentence prescribed is different from all other sentences.' The 2005 Appeal Court judgement on murder sentencing and guilty pleas, handed down by then Lord Chief Justice Lord Phillips and two other judges, considered sentences in two murder cases. The Appeal judges said: 'The court should consider the fact that the defendant has pleaded guilty to murder when deciding whether it is appropriate to order a whole life term.' However this decision was not included in the sentencing rules for murder handed down to judges in 2007. A spokesman for the Sentencing Council said: 'The practice in the courts will be unchanged. Judges have to follow the decisions set down by the Court of Appeal.' The Sentencing Council said last year that 56 murderers were serving whole-life terms, which mean that they will never leave prison. These include Levi Bellfield pictured, killer of Milly Dowler and two other women; alongside other serial murderers Peter Sutcliffe, Ian Brady, Dennis Nilson and Rosemary West The Council also said that general criminals who do not plead guilty at the first opportunity should get a lesser cut in their sentence. The bonus for an early guilty plea should remain a third off the sentence, it said, but those who plead guilty later in the court process should get only a fifth off their sentence rather than a quarter. The Sentencing Council chairman, Appeal judge Lord Justice Treacy, said: 'We want those who have committed crimes to admit their guilt as early as possible. When they do, it means victims and witnesses can be reassured that the offender has accepted responsibility for what they have done and that they are spared having to appear at court to testify. 'It also means that the police and Crown Prosecution Service can use their resources more efficiently to investigate and prosecute other cases.' But Dr Green said: 'If a judge is considering a whole life sentence it must be a case of truly evil murder. The sole consideration should be how strong a message of disapproval society wants to send. It should be sending the strongest possible message."
86,86,true/false,"Japan drops vax rollout, goes to Ivermectin, ENDS COVID almost overnight The ongoing COVID-19 nonsense here in the United States exists solely and exclusively because our governments have failed to use the correct treatment.  They used so-called ""vaccines"" when Japan has just proven, in less than ONE MONTH, that Ivermectin can wipe out the disease. Sweden's Public Health Agency on Wednesday recommended a temporary halt to the use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine among young adults, citing concerns over rare side effects to the heart. It said the pause should initially be in force until December 1, explaining that it had received evidence of an increased risk of side effects such as inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) and inflammation of the pericardium (pericarditis). {link to CBS News (Secure)] Finland, Denmark and Norway have also moved away from the COVID vaccines. Finland last Thursday joined Sweden, Denmark and Norway in recommending against use of Moderna Inc.’s Covid-19 vaccine in younger age groups, citing risks of rare cardiovascular side effects they said warranted the precautionary steps. Finland’s Institute for Health and Welfare said last Thursday it would pause use of the Moderna vaccine among men under the age of 30, following a similar step last Wednesday by Swedish regulators. Denmark last Wednesday said it wouldn’t offer the Moderna vaccine to under-18s as a precautionary measure. Norway on Wednesday advised that all under-18s shouldn’t be given the Moderna vaccine, even if they had already received one dose, and recommended that men under 30 consider getting the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech instead. Norwegian officials cited U.S., Canadian and Nordic data, saying the absolute risks remain low and calling the advice “a precautionary measure.” The European Medicines Agency said Thursday that new preliminary data from the Nordic countries supports a warning the agency adopted in July that inflammatory heart conditions called myocarditis and pericarditis can occur in very rare cases following vaccination with Covid-19 shots made by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech. By far, however, the absolute superstar among foreign nations dealing with COVID is Japan.  Japan has PULLED the vaccines and substituted Ivermectin - and in one month, wiped COVID out in that country! * Safe?

Just so you understand the timeline. By September deaths from the COVID-19 Vaccine jabs were being investigated. At roughly that time, the vials were under scrutiny and metal ""magnetic"" material was found in them. Very shortly thereafter, the Japanese minister of health announced doctors could prescribe Ivermectin. A month later, the Western press is shocked that COVID has all but disappeared from the island. Get it? Understand? This is what it looks like in a country that still has rule of law. The governemnt responds to reports of death and contaminated vaxes, moves to real treatment, people get better, and the virus disappears. Now compare that to what is happening in the United States and in Australia and New Zealand.  All three countries are in dismal failure in their handling of COVID-19, and that failure has resulted in staggering loss of freedom and destruction of commerce. This is the biggest news story right now. Japan has ended COVID. It did it after it stopped the vax rollout and went to Ivermectin. Period. Hard stop. Hal Turner Editorial Opinion If your government really wanted to end COVID, if that was its true goal, it would do what Japan did. You can use Japan as a case study any time someone starts yammering some crap about how the vax is about helping you help yourself from getting others sick with what they've been vaxed against. You use it as a case study when they try to make some lame argument about how the government is really really really trying its best to end COVID and it is the MAGA crowd that is causing the variants and keeping the virus around. Japan stopped vaxing.  Japan went to IVM.  Japan is COVID-free. It did it in less than a month! So if your government won't do what Japan did, now that JAPAN HAS BEAT COVID, what does it say about your government? It says the conspiracy theorists were right! They were right. It is a damning conviction of the narrative that the government is somehow a benevolent force against you getting viruses. No, because we now have historic precedent of a government doing the right thing and getting the WIN. If your government won't do it, it is because the vax is about something other than the public good. Hmmmm. What could it be about? How about totalitarian control! Japan got started vaxing later, and quit earlier than Massachusetts. Massachusetts is still fighting COVID with a couple thousand breakthrough cases per week. Japan is done."
87,87,true/false,"Scott Walker, Mary Burke draw sharp contrast on expanding vouchers News reports have confirmed that actor Kirk Douglas died of natural causes late this afternoon, Los Angeles coroners office reported. This was just 4 days before he would have turned 101 years old. Family released a statement saying he “went comfortably and was in no pain” and “lived a long and prosperous life that people only dream of.” Kirk Douglas was an American actor, producer, director, and author. He was one of the last living people of the film industry’s Golden Age. After an impoverished childhood with immigrant parents and six sisters, he had his film debut in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946) with Barbara Stanwyck. Douglas soon developed into a leading box-office star throughout the 1950s and 1960s, known for serious dramas, including westerns and war movies. During his career he appeared in more than 90 movies. Douglas was well known for his explosive acting style. As an actor and philanthropist, Douglas had received three Academy Award nominations, an Oscar for Lifetime Achievement, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. As an author, he had written ten novels and memoirs. He was No. 17 on the American Film Institute’s list of the greatest male screen legends of classic Hollywood cinema, and the highest-ranked living person on the list. After barely surviving a helicopter crash in 1991 and then suffering a stroke in 1996, he had focused on renewing his spiritual and religious life. He lived with his second wife (of 63 years), Anne Buydens, a producer. He was to turn 101 on December 9, 2016."
88,88,true/false,"Military Convicts Chelsea Clinton Marc Mezvinsky’s testimony resumed Thursday morning, and his remarks helped slam shut Chelsea Clinton’s proverbial coffin.  Rear Adm. Crandall opened the day by asking Mezvinsky about the 3 Haitian children who were passengers in Chelsea’s rented Mercedes at the time of her arrest.  “They were imported into the country some time ago; I don’t remember exactly when. They were meant to be gifts to a friend of the Clinton foundation,” Mezvinsky said.  “Interesting vernacular you have there. You use the word ‘imported’ as if they were a crate of microchips or lettuce. I think the words ‘abducted’ and ‘smuggled’ are more appropriate, don’t you? Who was this friend?” Rear Adm. Crandall asked.  Mezvinsky said he did not know. He claimed that he was to wait in the vehicle while Chelsea escorted the children to a hotel room in Rockport, Massachusetts. He also denied knowledge of the youngsters’ names, for Chelsea, like her mother, indecipherably scrambled proper names into anagrams to thwart attempts to track down smuggled children.  “Was it common for you and the defendant to personally deliver smuggled kids into the hands of pedophiles? You’re both high-profile people. Isn’t that a bit…risky and stupid?”  “It was rare, and she told me it was a special delivery. Besides, we had a get out of jail free card, like in the monopoly game,” Mezvinsky said.  “Get out of jail free card? Could you expand on that?” asked Rear Adm. Crandall.  “Say, for example, we got puled over by a state trooper, or even the feds, for whatever reason. They’d make one phone call and be told they’d have to release us, no questions asked,” Mezvinsky said.  “Are you suggesting, Mr. Mezvinsky, that local law enforcement and the intelligence agencies are subservient to the Clintons?” Rear Adm. Crandall asked.  “Absolutely,” Mezvinsky replied.  “It seems the Delta Force operators who arrested you didn’t honor that get out of jail free card you had,” Rear Adm. Crandall said.  “That was—unexpected,” Mezvinsky admitted.  Rear Adm. Crandall wanted to know if Hillary Chelsea Clinton knew the names of the thousands of children she and her family had sold to pedophiles, and the identities of the recipients.  “She does,” Mezvinsky said.  His admission caused Chelsea to launch into an inexorable rant against Mezvinsky, calling him a “spineless, sorry excuse of man, no backbone, no balls, piss-poor excuse of a husband. You keep your fucking mouth shut, that’s what you do, Marc.” Her outburst, Rear Adm. Crandall said, denoted a blatant contempt of courtroom civility, and he cautioned her to respect the court under threat of being gagged for the rest of the trial.  “During your testimony on Tuesday, Mr. Mezvinsky, you stated you were responsible for destroying evidence of Clinton crimes. But that’s not entirely true, is it? In your deposition, you told JAG you had screenshotted spreadsheets containing thousands of, how shall I put this, anagrammed names of both smuggled children and their intended recipients, including dollar amounts they were to be sold for. Is that correct?” Rear Adm. Crandall asked.  Mezvinsky nodded, saying he need “an insurance policy” against Clinton retaliation, in case they turned on him.  Rear Adm. Crandall approached the 3 officers tasked with judging the military’s evidence on Clinton. He laid on the table a ream of paper, saying the documents, regardless of muddled names, conclusively proved that Chelsea Clinton had authorized the selling of children who had been smuggled into the United States from countries such as Haiti, Columbia, and the Ukraine.  One recipient’s anagram–Tindus Komsovitz—appeared 11 times. Rear Adm. Crandall told the tribunal that U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command at Ft. Meade had rigorously scrutinized the database and deduced that “Tindus Komsovitz” was really Facebook Co-Founder Dustin Moskovitz, a longtime friend of the Clintons who had donated millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton’s election campaigns.  “I ask you, directly, Mr. Mezvinsky—did you and Chelsea Clinton sell children to Dustin Moskovitz?”  Rivulets of tears streamed down Mezvinsky’s face. “I’m sorry, yes, him and so, so many others.”  “And you’ll provide us the names you—” Rear Adm. Crandall started, but Chelsea rose to her feet and again lambasted her husband.  “You’ll keep your fucking mouth shut,” Clinton blurted, her voice a witch’s cackle.  Per Rear Adm. Crandall’s instructions, a pair of Marines gagged Clinton and dragged her from the chamber.  Rear Adm. Crandall asked the panel whether it had heard enough, and the officers unanimously found Chelsea Clinton guilty of all charges and recommended she be executed for crimes against humanity and for destroying the lives of countless families. Rear Adm. Crandall, however, admitted to quandary—could the U.S. military execute Clinton given the absence of evidence that she was guilty of murdering an American citizen or committing treason as stipulated under the Insurrection Act of 1812, the U.S. Constitution, or the Patriot Act.  Sentencing, Rear Adm. Crandall said, would commence “in days.”  “She will either be hanged or spend life at GITMO,” Rear Adm. Crandall said.  (Visited 154,720 times, 12 visits today)"
89,89,true/false,"Northern Ireland legally allows abortions for rape and incest victims Pro-choice protesters chant slogans at a protest Picture: PA  Victims of rape and incest will now be legally allowed to carry out abortions in Northern Ireland after a landmark legal challenge to relax the country’s strict laws proved successful.  Before the challenge, Northern Ireland was the only UK country that didn’t take up the 1967 Abortion Act – meaning that terminations were only legally permitted in instances where the life or mental health of the mother was in danger.  Anyone who performed an illegal termination faced the prospect of life imprisonment in jail.  But a challenge to the legal ruling was brought in July by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commision NIHRC – who wanted to legalise terminations in cases of rape, incest or fatal foetal abnormality.  MORE : BREAKING NEWS: 75% of Labour members ‘oppose Islamic State strikes in Syria’  Advertisement  Advertisement  MORE : Advertising junk food before 9pm could be banned in a bid to tackle obesity  And while a law change was recommended in circumstances of fatal foetal abnormality, the NIHRC argued that this was not enough – and said that the current law was incompatible with human rights legislation regarding inhuman and degrading treatment.  Delivering the latest breakthrough ruling, Judge Mr Justice Mark Horner told Belfast High Court: ‘In the circumstances, given this issue is unlikely to be grasped by the legislature in the foreseeable future; I conclude that the Article Eight [of the European Convention on Human Rights] rights of women in Northern Ireland who are pregnant with foetal abnormalities or as a result of sexual crime are breached by the impugned provisions.’  The judge also claimed that current Northern Irish law placed a ‘disproportionate’ burden on the victims of sexual crime.

90,90,true/false,"Is 5G to partially blame for coronavirus deaths? Can 5G cause the blood that’s circulating in your body to be unable to carry oxygen? What’s especially horrifying about the critical care of coronavirus patients is that they aren’t suffering from “viral pneumonia,” but rather from an inability to absorb or carry oxygen in the blood. This has been confirmed by NYC ICU emergency physician Cameron Kyle-Sidell, who has released several videos detailing how coronavirus is not a kind of viral pneumonia. “We’re treating the wrong disease,” he says. And the ventilators are damaging the lungs of patients. He explains: COVID-19 lung disease, as far as I can see, is not a pneumonia and should not be treated as one. Rather, it appears as if some kind of viral-induced disease most resembling high altitude sickness. Is it as if tens of thousands of my fellow New Yorkers are on a plane at 30,000 feet at the cabin pressure is slowly being let out. These patients are slowly being starved of oxygen. RUSH: Trump backs out of the Paris accords. Oh, do we have news on climate change today based on what happened in a courtroom in California. Let me give you the bare upshot of this. There’s a lawsuit being filed against the fossil fuel companies like Exxon and Texaco and — there’s five of ’em. And the suit has been brought by environmentalist wackos. They claim that all of these fossil fuel companies know that they are destroying the planet and are hiding the evidence. They claim in their lawsuit that they know that their business is creating the circumstances that cause climate change. So they filed this massive lawsuit. The judge in this case decided to have a little seminar before the trial actually began. And the climate change environmentalist wackos thought, “Oh, my God, this is a godsend. We’re gonna get to go in and we’re gonna rip these people a new one even before the trial begins.” But what happened was the judge is an educated and informed person when it comes to climate change, even though the judge is in California. And the upshot of it is that the environmentalist wackos were made fools of. They demonstrated they are lying. For example, one of these they said they had was a smoking gun memo, a smoking gun memo at Exxon and some of these other fossil fuel companies where they admit to themselves, internal memo, that they are destroying the planet, that they are engaging in activities causing massive amounts of C2O, causing greenhouse gases and the planet only has so much time. So the judge said, “Well, let me see. You say they’ve got it. Where is it? What does it say?” And the fossil fuel companies eagerly produced it. You know what it was? It was a slideshow from a U.N. presentation on the international committee of planetary whatever, the IPCC, whatever that stands for. It was simply a slideshow that the U.N. put together, that the environmentalist wackos have been lying about claiming it’s a smoking gun memo from the fossil fuel companies. The judge just made mincemeat of these people, demonstrated they’re lying, demonstrated they don’t know what they’re talking about and that there is no substance to their allegations at all. This is before the trial even began. And the trial has not yet begun. This was a preliminary stage. So the wackos have to go back now and reformulate their whole plan since their basic approach has just been nuked in court, since they have been exposed as lying, making things up. And, of course, everybody that believes in climate change believes what these wackos have been saying, so the world thought that these companies were gonna have their hats handed to ’em even before the trial began. And what ended up happening was the judge exposing the slime tactics of the environmentalist wackos. RUSH: I mentioned earlier in the program that the environmentalist wackos had their lunch handed to ’em in court out in California. I want to give you the details of this. ‘Cause any time there is a win, I’m gonna tell you about it. Any time there’s a reason for optimism, I’m gonna tell you about it. Any time the left takes it on the chin, I’m gonna tell you about it. Now, the Drive-Bys have reported the story, but they haven’t gone anywhere near what is really salient about it.I have here a column in the Wall Street Journal by Phelim McAleer. “Climate Alarmists May Inherit the Wind — They likened a courtroom ‘tutorial’ to the Scopes Monkey Trial. But their side got schooled.” Here’s the upshot of this story. “Five American oil companies find themselves in a San Francisco courtroom. California v. Chevron is a civil action brought by the city attorneys of San Francisco and Oakland, who accuse the defendants of creating a ‘public nuisance’ by contributing to climate change and of conspiring to cover it up so they could continue to profit.” Again, civil action, not criminal, meaning there would be damages if Big Oil is found liable here. And essentially the Drive-Bys and the environmentalist wackos thought they had stumbled across a brilliant maneuver, and that is to have global warming and climate change codified in law by having a court acknowledge that it exists and find these defendants liable. That was their plan. There was no date for the trial so far. However, on March 21st, a mere 10 to 11 days ago, “the litigants gathered for a ‘climate change tutorial'” that was ordered by the judge. The judge’s name is William Alsup. Now, the environmentalist wackos thought this was a gift from nirvana, since they don’t believe in heaven. They couldn’t believe their good luck, a climate change tutorial. You have to remember who these people are. The biggest obstacle that we’re up against in America, aside from the cultural rot, but I think the reason the cultural rot is taking place is we’re up against genuine stupidity. Too many generations have literally been taught nothing, including how to think. And so we’re up against — you may want to call it ignorance, but we’re up against genuine stupidity. And even among these environmentalist wackos and these city attorneys, they believe all of this claptrap that they have been saying about climate change all of these years, even though there isn’t any evidence for it. There isn’t any warming. All they’ve got is computer model predictions, folks. There isn’t yet any empirical evidence for their claim that greenhouse gases even cause temperatures to increase. There isn’t any empirical data for that. All of this is based on the come: Oh, my God, this is terrible, we can’t afford not to wait, we have to stop it. But there isn’t any truth. Not to mention the fact the last 15 years there hasn’t been any warming. Also, NOAA has been caught cheating and altering the annual temperature charts to show more warming than there has been, but it doesn’t matter. Because all of these environmentalist wackos and everybody who believes them and their city attorneys, they literally believe this stuff, just like they literally believe all the things they hate Trump for, they literally believe this. Like they believe Russia colluded with Trump, but it didn’t happen, there isn’t any evidence, but they’re convinced, they believe it. They’ve been saying it so long, thinking it so long, it’s gotta be true. So they walk into this courtroom, and they’re thinking this is it, this is where they’re gonna win every case. They’re gonna have a firmly established by a judge now that there is climate change. And once a court says it, that ends it, it doesn’t matter what other scientists say, it’s over. And that’s what they thought they were on the verge of, they were so excited. They could not contain themselves. But they didn’t know about Judge William Alsup. The environmentalist wackos were so excited about this that they had spectators, they had a giant crowd gathered outside the courtroom at 6 a.m. on March 21st, urged on by the advocates and their websites. And there were all kinds of signs, “Buckle up, polluters! You’re in for it now.” And they said this is gonna be the equivalent of the Scopes Monkey Trial. But in the end, it did not go well for the environmentalist wackos. And not for lack of legal talent. “Steve W. Berman, who represented the cities, is a star trial lawyer who has made a career and a fortune suing corporations for large settlements, including the $200 billion-plus tobacco settlement in 1998.” He was one of those lawyers. Michael Burger of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, told one of the websites getting the crowd to show up, “Until now, fossil fuel companies have been able to talk about climate science in political and media arenas where there is far less accountability to the truth.” Now, wait just a minute. Before we go further, stop and think of this line: “Until now, fossil fuel companies have been able to talk about climate science in political and media arenas where there is far less accountability to the truth.” In other words, if you want truth, do not involve journalism. If you want to find the truth, do not go anywhere near politics or journalism, because there isn’t any accountability to the truth in journalism. That, to me, is a humongous indictment, and that comes from a pro-climate change lawyer.“Judge Alsup started quietly. He flattered the plaintiffs’ first witness, Oxford physicist Myles Allen.” Judge Alsup called this physicist from Oxford a genius. He set him up. This guy’s standing there feeling his oats, he’s a genius, climate science genius, judge knows it. But then the judge reprimanded this physicist “for using a misleading illustration to represent carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and a graph ostensibly about temperature rise that did not actually show rising temperatures.” So the wackos, they brought their charts, and they brought their graphs, and their charts and graphs are made up BS. And they always have been. And the judge called an Oxford physicist, I mean, the epitome of a white lab coat scientist. And this guy was chopped off at the knees. The judge chastised this guy for using a misleading illustration to show carbon in the atmosphere. In other words, there wasn’t nearly as much in the atmosphere as this guy’s chart showed. And his graph about temperature increase did not show temperature increase. He just brought a complicated bunch of charts and graphs, said this is what it represents. The judge said, “Wait, what is that? What is that? What is that?” The judge illustrated that they were using bogus data so now they’re thinking, uh-oh, we got somebody who knows what we’re talking about here in the form of a judge. They thought, a San Francisco judge? This is gonna be a cakewalk. “Then the pointed questions began. Gary Griggs, an oceanographer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, struggled with the judge’s simple query: ‘What do you think caused the last Ice Age?'” Now, stick with me on this. “What caused the last Ice Age?” Remember, they are there to claim that all of these oil companies are causing uncontrollable warming. The judge says, “What do you think caused the last Ice Age?” The professor — you ready for this? — the professor said, well, there was a wobble in the earth’s orbit. And he went to describe the period, quote, “before there were humans on the planet,” which “we call hothouse Earth.” “‘That was when ‘all the ice melted. We had fossils of palm trees and alligators in the Arctic,’ Mr. Griggs told the court. He added that at one time the sea level was 20 to 30 feet higher than today. Mr. Griggs then recounted ‘a period called “snow ballers,”‘ when scientists ‘think the entire Earth was frozen due to changes in things like methane released from the ocean.'” Remember, these accounts of two apocalyptic climate events occurred naturally from a witness for plaintiffs hoping to prove that oil companies are causing warming and he was forced to admit that both warming and cooling happened in catastrophic ways long before there were oil companies. They were forced to deal with their actual claims, and a judge made mincemeat of them! They finally had an opponent who was informed and not sympathetic like the media is, and they were so embarrassed, and maybe more so than they even have the ability to understand. RUSH: One more thing about this tutorial in the San Francisco court with the environmentalist wackos suing five American oil companies for causing climate change and knowing it, polluting greenhouse gases and knowing it. The judge handed lunch to these people. The environmentalist wackos were humiliated and embarrassed in one other way. The plaintiff’s lawyer made a claim that there was a smoking gun document that the oil companies had, a memo that they had sent and read, prepared for each other that admitted they were polluting, admitted that fossil fuels as a business caused climate change. So the judge asked to see it. “The plaintiffs alleged that the oil companies were in possession of ‘smoking gun’ documents that would prove their liability,” and one of the lawyers, Theodore Boutrous, “said this was simply an internal summary of the publicly available 1995 IPCC report,” which is a U.N. organization. So the environmentalist wackos claimed there is a smoking-gun document that proves the oil companies know they are polluting. The judge asked to see it. What it turns out to be is nothing more than a United Nations-written internal summary of the publicly available U.N. 1995 International Panel On Climate Change report. The oil companies didn’t write it. It’s not a smoking gun. All it was was a political document written by the U.N. that was available publicly. It was a summary, you know, like two pages to summarize what’s in 500 pages. They got caught lying! The environmentalist wackos were lying claiming there was a smoking gun memo and document when it turns out it was nothing more than a U.N. summary of a report they had written in ’95 blaming the oil companies. “The judge said he read the lawsuit’s allegations to mean ‘that there was a conspiratorial document within the defendants about how they knew good and well that global warming was right around the corner. And I said: “OK, that’s going to be a big thing. I want to see it.” Well, it turned out it wasn’t quite that. What it was, was a slide show that somebody had gone to the IPCC and was reporting on what the IPCC had reported, and that was it. Nothing more.'”
There was no smoking-gun memo. The lawyers for the environmentalist wackos had totally made it up and lied about it. So they were on notice. The judge said, “If you want to respond, I’ll let you respond. Is there anything you want to say?” And the lawyer for the wackos said, “No.” Whereupon the judge adjourned the proceedings. This is all before the trial even starts, folks. And so they were smoked. They were exposed as the frauds that they are. It was shown how they’re making things up and lying, how the media simply regurgitates it because they even admit here, the media is nowhere to go for accountability to truth. Little steps, little steps."
91,91,true/false,"Ministers urged to ban fast food outlets from opening near schools Fast food outlets should be banned from opening within 400 metres of schools in England, according to leading child doctors.  The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health urged the government to introduce the measure as part of its updated childhood obesity strategy, published this summer.  The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has suggested a ban on any new fast food outlets being built within such distance and the college called for this to be extended across the UK.  Prof Russell Viner, the president of the college, said ministers should “take a leap of faith” and introduce the measures to make it easier for councils to keep junk food away from students.  In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, he said: “Kids are coming out of school hungry and finding themselves surrounded by cheap chicken shops, chip shops and other types of junk food. This just wasn’t the case 20 or 30 years ago.  “People tend to eat what’s in front of them and we need to make it easier for children to make the right choices.”  Viner said local authorities needed increased powers to make it easier to bring in such bans. A number of councils have introduced these measures, but others said they faced too much red tape.    It comes as data shows that almost a third of children aged two to 15 are overweight or obese and younger generations are becoming obese at earlier ages and staying obese for longer.    In May, the Commons health and social care committee will open hearings for an inquiry on childhood obesity, examining areas that they should take action.  The college also proposed that there be a national programme to weigh and measure children from birth through to their teenage years. It called for GPs to be given training in how to talk to parents about children who gain weight.    “We need to be prepared to have difficult conversations and to make every contact [with health services] count in the fight against obesity,” Viner said.  He added: “We have to take a leap of faith to protect current and future generations.”"
92,92,true/false,"SPANISH HIGH COURT CONFIRMS THAT COVID-19 DOES NOT EXIST Spain is the 9th country to take the health minister to court, asking for PROOF that the COVID-19 virus exists. However, all health ministers FAILED to come up with the evidence because the virus DOES NOT EXIST.  The Spanish health minister didn't even attend the hearing. Instead, the minister sent a letter explaining that NO EVIDENCE for the virus's existence can be found.  It's easy to understand why no politician can ever show the proof: COVID-19 was PATENTED years ago after being manufactured in a lab.  In other words, COVID-19 is a BIOWEAPON.

93,93,true/false,"MI Sec of State Official Caught On Video Telling Volunteers To Count “Multiple Ballots with the very Same Signature” During “Audit” Of Votes In Antrim County Constitutional Attorney Matthew DePerno is an American hero. Two weeks ago, Michigan 13th Circuit Court Judge Kevin A Elsenheimer agreed to allow Mr. DePerno’s client, William Bailey, and a highly skilled team of IT experts to perform a forensic examination on 16 of the Dominion voting machines in Antrim County. On Monday, Judge Elsenheimer agreed to allow the results of the forensic examination to be released to the public. The results were damning.  THE REPORT:  After the forensic examination of 16 Dominion Voting machines in Antrim, Co., MI, Allied Security Operations Group has concluded that the Dominion Voting machines were assigned a 68.05% error rate. DePerno explained that when ballots are put through the machine, a whopping 68.05% error rate means that 68.05% of the ballots are sent for bulk adjudication, which means they collect the ballots in a folder. “The ballots are sent somewhere where people in another location can change the vote,” DePerno explained. The allowable election error rate established by the Federal Election Commission guidelines is 1 in 250,000 ballots or .0008%.  Based on the Allied Security Operations report, Constitutional Attorney Matthew DePerno states: “we conclude that The Dominion Voting System should not be used in Michigan. We further conclude that the results of Antrim County should not have been certified.  The stunning report was widely criticized by the Democrat Party mainstream media and by the dishonest Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson.  TRENDING: ""I Went There for You My Son"" - J6 Political Prisoner Chris Quaglin Was Brutally Beaten in Jail and Denied Celiac-Safe Food - Here Is His Heartfelt Letter to His Son on His First Birthday -- Please Donate  Following the bombshell findings by Mr. DePerno and his team of IT experts, a “risk-limited audit” was ordered by Sec. of State Benson. Constitutional Attorney Matt DePerno was invited to observe the “risk-limiting audit” of Antrim County’s vote that took place yesterday in the Kearney Twp. hall in Bellaire, MI., where 6 officials from the Secretary of State continuously walked around the room observing and correcting the counters who dared to stray from their objectives.  According to Verified Voting: The risk-limiting audit process can be conducted on any set of paper ballots that has a record of the number of ballots cast, how they are stored, and how to retrieve any particular ballot (ballot manifest). For an RLA to meaningfully support confidence in the reported election outcome, the standard is higher, and requires the following:  Paper ballots preferably marked by hand and supplemented with a ballot marking device for those who need to use one.  A deliberate and intentional step for a voter to check the paper ballot for accuracy before casting the ballot (voter verification).  Rigorous ballot accounting and a properly maintained chain of custody of the ballots.  If photographic evidence proves seals on the Dominion voting machines were broken on November 27, how can a “properly maintained chain of custody of ballots” be assured. The answer is, it can’t.  Before her so-called audit was completed, Sec of State Benson explained the purpose of the “risk limited audit” to the media while ensuring the integrity of the elections in Michigan:  “While we know the machine tabulators functioned properly in Antrim, we are conducting this audit to assure the public of what countless officials from both parties at the federal, state and local levels have already confirmed – that this was the most secure election in our nation’s history and the certified results are an accurate reflection of the will of the voters,” adding, “It is time for Michigan, and the nation to once and for all dismiss the meritless disinformation campaign that seeks to undermine the integrity of our election and move forward in support of our collective democracy.”  Mr. DePerno, who acted as an observer to the “risk-limited audit,” doesn’t agree with Ms. Benson about the integrity of Michigan’s election and has provided us with video and photographic evidence to prove that he was again able to debunk her statement about the “most secure election in our nation’s history.”  The first video provided by Matthew DePerno shows a bin of ballots from Mancelona Township, Precinct #1. The bin was delivered to three of the 20 bi-partisan volunteers that included several Antrim Co. city clerks who agreed to assist with the “risk-limited audit.”  Inside the bin, tabulated ballots were mixed in with ballots that were never tabulated, and several blank ballots were mixed in as well. Mr. DePerno referred to the bin of ballots as “an absolute mess!” On December 16, we reported about photographs taken at Mancelona Township’s Precinct #1 on November 27, 2020, that showed both of the security seals on the Dominion Voting machine were missing.  The second video was taken at a table where ballots were being counted in Helena Twp. The volunteers can be seen questioning why there were fewer ballots in the bin than the original number that was recorded in the previous recount? Shortly after asking the question, a male SOS official approached the table with a bag marked “spoiled ballots” and told them to count them. ATtorney Matt DePerno witnessed the unidentified male SOS rep pulling the “spoiled ballot bag out of the bin and delivering it to the volunteers who were “auditing” the ballots. DePerno also witnessed the SOS official telling them to add the “spoiled ballots” to the count.  The third video was taken at a table where the ballots from Central Lake Twp. were being counted. In the video, a male counter can be seen questioning “multiple ballots with the same signature.” According to Matthew DePerno, 138 ballots had write-in-votes where the penmanship was exactly the same.  In the video below, the SOS official can be seen demanding that the counters ignore what they believe is voter fraud and count the ballots.  “We need to do the counts because if we don’t have the counts, then we can’t move forward. And we understand that there is a concern with this precinct—but this is not a time for you to be investigating right now.”  “Did you find something else?” the male counter asks.  “No,” she replies, adding, “So, you need to move forward with the audit, so we can get the numbers, so we can see how many ballots are here.”  The female counter asks, “So when we’re done with the audit, there’s still the opportunity to challenge the fact that we have multiple ballots with the very same signature?” she asks.  “I don’t know if ‘challenge’ is the right word,” the SOS official says.  “But we’re challenging—” the volunteer says.  The male volunteer tells the SOS, “We’ll go ahead and count the ballots moving forward, but we will separate out, and count those— there’s going to be an asterisk, saying ‘these ballots have the same signature.'”  “And again, we know that you have a concern with this precinct,” she tells them, explaining, “That’s not your role at this very moment,” as she continues to push for them to ignore the multiple matching signatures and only count the ballots.  “What I need you to do right now is finish the audit,” she tells them again. Both of the volunteers explain that they are going to make a note of the ballots, to which the SOS official replies, “Again, that is not the process.”  The SOS official implores them to continue to count the presidential ballots.  At no point does the SOS official assure them that the issue of the multiple potentially fraudulent ballots will be addressed, but instead demands that they count them as if they were all legitimate ballots.  In this video, the SOS official can be seen telling the volunteers who are objecting to adding the ballots in question to the vote total, “This is not an investigation right now!”  On December 16, one day after Dominion Voting Systems CEO John Poulos testified in front of the MI Senate Oversight Committee, Mr. DePerno contacted us to say Poulos was incorrect in his statement that the ballots were securely stored. In fact, Mr. Derno provided us with photos showing seals were broken on one of the tabulators. DePerno explained, “In Central Lake, the lock that protects the side data port where you can insert a thumb drive in order to perform a software upgrade, that could change the program, was missing.” He explains, “The missing lock gives the ability of any person, including a voter to change the Dominion Voting machine program.”  Mr. DePerno explained to us that once the seals are broken, and the lock is removed, the integrity of the machines has been compromised. “It definitely showed that someone had accessed the inside of the tabulator, and it no longer represents a secure voting platform,” DePerno said.  The bin (or box) seen in the image below is where the ballots are stored. DePerno explained, “If you remove the tape, it gives you the ability to separate the tabulator from the box that contains the ballots.”  The photo below shows the stack of ballots in Central Lake that were cast for Joe Biden. The ballots that are pulled forward are all ballots that the counters pulled forward after objecting to the legitimacy of the ballots.  Mr. DePerno was stunned by the number of blank ballots that were mixed in with actual ballots, saying that he believes he observed more blank ballots in the recount than there are registered voters in Antrim County.  DePerno told us, “The guidelines from RLA were not followed. What they did yesterday was not an audit under those guidelines. It was a hand recount of the presidential race only and failed to address many of the problems with down-ballot races. Members of the public who assisted in the hand recount were not allowed to ask any questions or question any ballots. This hand recount also failed to address any of the glaring problems from the erroneous counts conducted on November 3 and November 6. Yesterday was nothing more than political theatre designed to allow the Secretary of State to again publish the same false narrative to the Michigan voters. Yesterday, when the people conducting the count dared ask questions, they were shut down.”  DePerno’s forensic and photographic evidence should be enough to call the entire Michigan election into question. Will the media or the courts care, or have we now entered a period in our nation’s history where we have officially become a Banana Republica after decades of Republicans ignoring the corruption of our media and our judicial system."
94,94,true/false,"Wisconsin Election Commission Directive Allows Clerks To ‘Fix’ Ballots [UPDATED] This article has been updated to include more context about the directive as well as the commission’s defense of its policy. A new report points out that an executive branch agency called the Wisconsin Election Commission issued a directive in October telling local county election clerks that they can “fix” ballots by filling in missing addresses for witnesses. According to one former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice, the policy, which has been in place since October 2016, may violate a Wisconsin law requiring ballots to have a witness address to be validated. The commission has defended its policy, however, stating that the law “does not specify who affixes the address.” Wisconsin Statute 6.876d states, “If a certificate is missing the address of a witness, the ballot may not be counted.” But in August, the Wisconsin Elections Commission issued a memo telling clerks they could fill in the address of the voter: To make sure your ballot is counted, double check the following before you return it: Your voter information: this section is usually completed by your clerk and includes the date of the election, the county and municipality in which you are registered, your name, the address where you are registered, city, and zip code. Voter Signature: you or your assistant must sign in the Certification of Voter section. Witness Signature and Address: your witness must sign and provide their full address, street number, street name, city in the Certification of Witness section. Make sure your ballot is in your envelope and make sure the envelope is sealed properly. If any of the required information above is missing, your ballot will not be counted. In October, the Wisconsin Elections Commission issued a directive to the state’s county clerks that seemed to allow them to fix incomplete or “spoiled” ballots missing witness signatures, writing, “Please note that the clerk should attempt to resolve any missing witness address information prior to Election Day if possible and this can be done through reliable information personal knowledge, voter registration information, through a phone call with the voter or witness. The witness does not need to appear to add a missing address.” As noted by Wisconsin Election Commission public information officer Reid Magney, the guidance has been in place since October 2016. “The guidance has been in effect for 11 statewide elections, including the 2016 presidential and presidential recount, and no one has objected to it until now,” said Magney, as reported by USA Today. An Oct. 18, 2016 memo from the commission reads in part formatting adjusted: [T]he Commission’s guidance is that municipal clerks shall do all that they can reasonably do to obtain any missing part of the witness address. Those steps may include one or more of the following options: 1. The clerk is able to reasonably discern the missing address or address component by information appearing on the envelope or from some other source, such as: The voter has provided his or her complete address and the clerk has personal knowledge that the witness resides at the same address as the voter. The clerk has personal knowledge of the witness and knows his/or her address. The voter’s complete address appears on the address label, and the witness indicates the same street address as the voter. The clerk is able to utilize lists or databases at his or her disposal to determine the witness’s address. 2. The voter or witness may wish to appear in person to add the missing information, or provide the address information by phone, fax, email or mail. The voter may provide the address separately as an alternative to returning the certificate envelope and having the voter mail it back again as outlined below. 3. The voter may request that the clerk return the certificate envelope so the voter can personally add the witness address. […] 4. The voter may wish to spoil the original ballot and vote a new one. Derek Muller, a professor of law at the Iowa School of Law, told Just The News, “This is a complication thing about elections like this. I’ve seen it in a lot of jurisdictions, what might be sort of a technical violation of the statute, in this case encouragement to county clerks about how to use their judgment on whether or not to cure a ballot.” Retired Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman told WISN, “The statute is very, very clear. If an absentee ballot does not have a witness address on it, it’s not valid. That ballot is not valid.” “In defiance of and direct contradiction to the statute, the Wisconsin Elections Commission gave guidance — that is, cover —to all 72 county clerks and turned the statute on its head,” said Gableman. “They said, ‘Gee, we know the law says an absentee ballot without the witness address is not valid, but county clerk, you have a duty to go ahead and look up on your own the witness’ address if there’s no address on the absentee ballot.’” The Wisconsin Election Commission, however, maintains that its policies are not in violation of the law, asserting that the law “does not specify who affixes the address” and noting that the addresses have been added to the certificates rather than the ballots themselves, as AFP reports.

95,95,true/false,"Biden to Send $3 Trillion on Plane to Iran as Apology for Soleimani Assassination Following in the footsteps of his mentor, Barak Hussein Obama, Joe Biden is preparing to cower to the Iranian Caliphate in the form of a $3 trillion apology for the Trump administration’s assassination of their top General, Qassem Soleimani.  While the assassination was celebrated by democracies worldwide, Democrats in the US accused Trump of showboating, resulting in raised tensions with the Muslim country.  The continuous funneling of cash from US taxpayers to Iran between the Obama, and now Biden administrations, is shameful. While our veterans lay homeless on our streets and our corporations are being threatened with higher taxes, Democrats have decided to fund a known enemy to the US.  This is the very definition of treason. Not even bleeding heart Jimmy Carter sank so low in his dealings with Iran.  The jet, handpicked by Biden’s Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, is a Dassault Falcon 8X. While the Dassault made its name in the military and commercial aircraft space, the larger Falcon jets carved out a niche in the business space due to their impressive range 5,950 nautical miles, a digital flight control system, and an ability to customize the plane’s interiors into 30+ formats depending on usage priorities.  With the versatility to make both long-range and short-range trips courtesy of a tri-jet engine, the Falcon models offer speed, efficiency, and improved comfort. Sources tell us there will be a handwritten note from Biden on top of the cash that will simply say, “Enjoy the cash. Keep the Jet.”  Due to its payload, this flight will take on a particular significance in aeronautic history. It will be the most valuable payload ever transported by aircraft. To bear this grave responsibility, Bilken enlisted retired US Airways pilot Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, famed pilot depicted by the legendary Tom Hanks in the 2016 blockbuster hit “Sully”.  Sullenberger insisted his longtime personal flight steward Andres Esquer be along for the all-important flight. Esquer famously served an entire Boeing 777 full of rowdy Oasis fans two cocktails each from one single liter of vodka on an international flight from Heathrow to JFK in 1998, a feat that is still mentioned during pillow talk amongst flight attendants and pilots to this day.  He is certified in CPR and BJJ. He is also an amateur pilot, more than capable of manhandling the aircraft should anything unfortunate befall Sully.  The offer of cash as an apology only serves to lessen our standing in the world. The only silver lining here is that it is being delivered by the best America has to offer."

But experts who have been analysing the Sun believe there is evidence to suggest that it could last until 2055. The Sun follows 11 year cycles where it reaches a solar maximum and then a solar minimum. Are we in hot weather peak? Solar minimum could bring big freeze Space weather: NASA predicts next solar maximum will peak on THIS date During a solar maximum, the Sun gives off more heat and is littered with sunspots. Less heat in a solar minimum is due to a decrease in magnetic waves. However, there are occasions when a solar minimum or maximum can go on for more than one cycle. The most famous example of this is the Maunder minimum, which saw seven decades of freezing weather, began in 1645 and lasted through to 1715, and happened when sunspots were exceedingly rare. During this period, temperatures dropped globally by 1.3 degrees celsius leading to shorter seasons and ultimately food shortages in what was called a “mini Ice Age”."

Democrat Senator Ginny Talia was talking with colleagues Monday and was overheard saying :  “Americans over 70 years old should just be euthanized. That’s how to save social security.”  The remarks were made following a Senate Sub-committee meeting on how to keep Social Security from being taken over by those who would oppose one of the great hallmarks of our capitalist economy. It is felt by many on The Hill that liberals are lying in wait to take over the program and put their grubby socialist mark all over it. This was evidenced by the words of Miss Talia.  But she didn’t stop with that remark. Talia’s disgusting rant was captured on cell phone video by a passerby so we have all the details :  “Seriously, why do we even keep them around? I mean thank you for your service but you no longer serve any purpose in society. There’s so damn many of them now. Boomers. Our infrastructure can’t support them. Socialism is about protecting the good of all. The few make sacrifices for the whole. Geriatrics should be saying to themselves,’We are a burden on society. Our children will suffer for our selfishness in staying alive.’ And all they talk about is patriotism. Caring for your country. If they were really patriotic, they’d be lining up to be euthanized. Or, better yet, they’d save the government the money and take care of it themselves.”  The government ethics committee intends to look into the remarks of Sen. Talia. If it is found that her words amount to hate speech, she could be removed from office and jeered for having such thoughts. Here’s hoping."

Sometimes they'll include recommendations for other related newsletters or services we offer. Our Privacy Notice explains more about how we use your data, and your rights. You can unsubscribe at any time.  The total is 10 times the number officially recorded as being referred to specialist paediatric units, meaning the problem is significantly worse than first feared. Experts last night warned of a looming catastrophe with tens of thousands of young people expected to be diagnosed as diabetic in years to come. More than a third of children are leaving primary school overweight or obese. NHS consultant cardiologist and clean living campaigner Dr Aseem Malhotra said: These truly shocking figures reflect the gravest health crisis of our time, underpinned by a collective failure to give children the best start for a healthy life. This is due to a combination of factors including government failing to protect the public from the deliberate targeting of children by the junk food industry. It's also a failure of Public Health England to acknowledge that Type 2 is a condition of carbohydrate intolerance that can be reversed from eating a healthy diet.  I'm regularly giving dietary advice to my own patients suffering from weight problems and Type 2 to cut out ultra-processed foods. Essentially that's anything that comes out of a packet and has five or more ingredients should be eaten as an occasional treat, perhaps once a week, not daily. Treating The total of 6,836 sufferers under 25 was revealed by Diabetes UK and is based on the numbers treated in GP practices for the condition in England and Wales in 2016/17. Before this the most reliable data was from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health earlier this year which said paediatric diabetes units were treating only 715 people under the age of 25 for Type 2. Vascular surgeon Martin Claridge, one of the UK's leading authorities on the condition, said: This is the tip of the iceberg. There are going to be many more young people out in the community who have not yet been diagnosed. As a society we appear to be sleep walking into this crisis.  Type 2 diabetes is caused by obesity, lifestyle and poor diet  Already more than one child in five is obese or overweight in their first year of primary school, illustrating the scale of the timebomb facing the NHS. There is already a sugar tax on some soft drinks but campaigners say it should be extended to food, and drinks not subject to the levy, like milkshakes, some of which contain as much as 16 teaspoons of sugar. Supermarkets regularly advertise promotions aimed at children with family packs of branded chocolate and biscuits available for just £1. Even sports organisations stand accused of making the crisis worse. McDonald's has been a key commercial partner of the Football Association for 15 years. And earlier this year the FA renewed its long-standing partnership with confectionary giant Mars, which makes Mars bars, Milky Way, M&Ms, Skittles, Snickers, and Twix. The company is now the official supporter of the England men's, women's and disabled teams. Campaigners want all labelling of added sugars to be marked in teaspoons rather than grams, all sugary drinks advertising on TV and internet demand services outlawed, and companies associated with sugary products to be banned from sponsoring sporting events.  Birmingham has been shamed as Britain's diabetes capital, where one in 10 now has the disease. Type 1 diabetes, which is suffered by Theresa May, is not caused by diet. But Type 2 often is. A lifelong condition, it leads to serious complications such as blindness, amputations, heart disease and kidney failure It usually develops over the age of 40 in white Europeans or after 25 in people who are African-Caribbean, African, or South Asian. The condition is much more aggressive in children and young people than in adults, with a higher overall risk of complications that tend to appear much earlier. The risk of developing Type 2 is significantly increased by 33 percent being overweight or obese. Bridget Turner, Diabetes UK's director of policy and campaigns, said: Type 2 can be devastating for children and young people. To help shape a future where fewer children develop the condition, we need continued commitment across society to create an environment that reduces obesity. We need to encourage healthy living by providing viding Treating each clear and easy to understand nutritional information about the products we are all buying, and protect children from adverts for foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar.  Ways to prevent becoming a diabetic  Overall, more than four million people in the UK have diabetes and a further 12 million living chronically unhealthy lifestyles are at increased risk of Type 2. The disease has become a huge drain on the NHS, costing £14billion a year to treat – or £1million every hour. The number of related prescriptions issued the disease year has rocketed by 80 percent in a decade. The Department of Health and Social Care said: We are committed to halving child obesity by 2030 and will be launching consultations to restrict promotions in shops for sugary and fatty foods, as well as a 9pm watershed ban on advertising. The upcoming NHS longterm plan will have prevention at its core.  How sufferers are affected Affecting around 90 percent of diabetes sufferers, Type 2 is usually caused by lifestyle factors such as obesity, lack of exercise and poor diet. It occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin or the hormone does not work properly, and is more common in people over the age of 30. Often diagnosed in childhood, Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the body attacks the cells in the pancreas that make insulin and it is not produced at all. As insulin regulates the amount of glucose allowed into the body, both types cause a build up of blood sugar that can cause serious health problems.  Consumption of too many sugary drinks can cause Type 2 diabetes  Sugary drinks cause a 'greater risk' Artificially sweetened drinks put people at a greater risk of developing Type 2 diabetes than other sugary foods, a study has warned. Researchers found that products with added fructose introduce excess nutrient poor energy into the diet and can have a harmful effect on blood sugar levels. However that was not the case with food and drink where fructose occurs naturally such as in whole fruit and juice, vegetables and honey. Previously it was unclear whether avoiding food where free sugars occur naturally could also be beneficial.  The current advice is just to reduce the amount of items where free sugars are added such as soft drinks, breakfast cereals, sweets and desserts. Researchers compiled results from 155 studies that looked into how different foods containing fructose sugars affect blood glucose levels in people with and without diabetes. They found most foods containing fructose sugars do not have a harmful effect on blood glucose levels as long as they do not provide too many calories. Fruit and juice may even have beneficial effects on blood glucose and insulin control, especially in people with diabetes. But foods that add excess nutrient poor energy to the diet, especially sweetened drinks, seem to have the most harmful effects on health. The researchers, based in the Canadian city of Toronto, said the higher fibre content of fruit could help to explain the improvements in blood glucose levels, as it slows down the release of sugars. Lead author Dr John Sievenpiper said more studies were needed but added: These findings might help guide recommendations on important food sources of fructose in diabetes prevention and management. Public health professionals should be aware harmful effects of fructose sugars on blood glucose seem to be mediated by energy and food source.  Only decisive action now will be able to halt crisis Comment by Robin Hewings WITH one in three children either overweight or obese before they leave primary school, it is now clearer than ever that bold, decisive action needs to be taken. In the latest chapter of its Childhood Obesity Plan, the Government laid out its commitment to halving childhood obesity by 2030. Our latest analysis provides yet more evidence that the Government, and industry, urgently need to turn these commitments into action. Type 2 diabetes is a serious, life-long condition that can lead to devastating complications. What we're seeing in these new figures is that obesity is driving this alarming increase in the number of children and young people with the condition, which is potentially setting them up for a lifetime of poor health.  Robin Hewings [twitter.com/RobinHewings]  The NHS must provide appropriate specialist services to support children with Type 2 to manage the condition and reduce the risk of serious complications. But the diabetes crisis is one that must be fought on many fronts. We want to see continued funding within the NHS for preventing Type 2 and a commitment to the improvement of care services which reflects the seriousness of this growing epidemic. And the fact is, we live in a society where making the healthy choice is not always the easy choice."

As it turns out, this may be exactly what Canada is doing… by Mike Adams of Natural News Natural News The Canadian government, on its official acquisition website Buyandsell.gc.ca is requesting bids for “Programmable Hydraulic Guillotines” as part of, “products and services in support of Canada’s response to COVID-19.” The listing number is 45045-190091/A, and it is found at this link: https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-data/tender-notice/PW-PD-005-78707 Additional details on the bid include: Reference number: PW-$$PD-005-78707 Solicitation number: 45045-190091/A Region of delivery: National Capital Region Notice type: Notice of Proposed Procurement NPP GSIN: N7520: Office Devices and Accessories Procurement entity: Public Works and Government Services Canada The “Programmable Hydraulic Guillotines” listing on the Canadian government’s website is explained on the site as “products and services in support of Canada’s response to COVID-19.” “Guillotine” is a term that describes a mechanical device with a powerful chopping blade that can slice things apart. Although there are industrial uses for cutting devices — such as in the book publishing industry — the term “guillotine” specifically refers to a device intended to execute human beings. As the Cambridge online dictionary explains, “guillotine” is a device that’s used to kill people by cutting off their heads: Here’s an image of a paper cutting machine, which is more commonly called a “shear” or cutting machine. This is not a guillotine, even though paper cutting companies might be used as a front for acquiring actual guillotines: Antifa and left-wing BLM terrorists have recently displayed mock-up guillotines on the streets of America as part of their protest actions, demanding that the people with whom they disagree be executed via guillotine. Guillotines were also used in the French Revolution to execute political dissidents who opposed the incoming socialist regime. Canadian official asks why covid camps are being constructed in Canada, gets silenced It is difficult to imagine how guillotines would be needed to respond to COVID-19 unless Canada was building covid death camps to “process” people who refuse to submit to mass vaccinations. As it turns out, this may be exactly what Canada is doing. See this article: Canadian government erecting a network of covid detainment camps and “isolation” sites to incarcerate those who don’t cooperate with medical tyranny. As that article explains: Justin Trudeau and the Canadian government are creating Nazi Germany-like infrastructure to detain human beings en masse, and for years to come. A brave Ontario politician named Randy Hillier spoke out about the government’s nefarious detainment plan in a provincial question period in front of the government of Ontario. His microphone was cut off as soon as he started asking the tough questions. Randy Hillier, Independent Ontario MPP for Lanark, Frontenac and Kingston, stood up and questioned the government, asking how many people will be detained and how many concentration camps are scheduled for construction. He expressed concern about their current use — to control the spread of covid-19 — and pointed out in documentation that these sites could be used for “other requirements” in the future. “So your government must be in negotiations and aware of these plans to potentially detain and isolate citizens and residents of our country and our province,” Hillier began. “So speaker, to the Premier, where will these camps be built, how many people will be detained, and for what reason, for what reasons can people be kept in these isolation camps, and I’d like to have the Premier assure the people of Ontario…,” Hillier’s microphone was cut off before he could finish. See the video here, which has been banned from YouTube: Additional details on the hydraulic guillotines request from the Canadian government Solicitation document #ABES.PROD.PW__PD.B005.E78707.EBSU000 reveals additional details about the bid request: The bid document lists technical requirements for the guillotines, under a heading called “Guillotines Mandatory Requirements:” The Guillotine’s cutting and clamping systems must be fully hydraulic; The Guillotine’s automatic blade and clamp must return from every position to its original starting position; starting position; The Guillotine’s blade depth adjustments must be achievable from outside of the Guillotine; Guillotine; The Guillotine’s measurement readout must be in imperial measurement; The Guillotine’s blade changing tool, wrenches/screwdrivers and cutting block must be provided for each Guillotine; The document also calls for a “1 year parts and labour warranty” to make sure the guillotine continues running smoothly so that the chopping isn’t interrupted. Is this bid for industrial use, or something more sinister? A skeptic might look at this government bid and conclude it must be a bid for cutting equipment to be used in cutting books, stacks of papers or posters. One of the companies involved in the bid appears to be a printing company, for example. But wouldn’t that also be the perfect cover story for acquiring actual guillotines intended for a more sinister purpose? Given that Canada is already in the process of constructing covid “concentration camps” — while touting this guillotine bid as part of “Canada’s response to COVID-19,” many people will have serious questions about the intended use of these devices as well as the language used to describe them. If these were merely industrial cutting machines, wouldn’t the listing just say, “Cutting Machine” instead of “Guillotines?” And given the history of guillotines being used during radical left-wing revolutions in France, many people are wondering whether China’s corruption of modern-day Canada — including its French-speaking regions — means that China is planning to round up and execute anyone resisting communist influences in Canada. With Justin Trudeau now appearing to be a political puppet of China — much like Joe Biden — and with Chinese troops already staged in Western Canada, these are no longer idle questions. See this important story: Western Canada has already fallen to Communist China – America may have a chance, but only if it stands united. Dave Hodges of The Commonsense Show recently published an article describing plans to round up Americans and incarcerate them in Canadian concentration camps run by communist Chinese. That article explains: Steve Quayle and myself have been investigating a three-nation deal involving Communist China, Canada and the United States. The deal has now expanded to NATO forces, living in American bases that were closed during the Bush Sr., era. The CSS has also learned that their is some UN involvement as well. The agreements have to do with ridding America’s new Harris-Biden administration of any and all. Unfortunately, the interview that is presented below on this topic is a work in progress. The implications of this interview is frightening as it promises an international, state-sponsored genocidal program against “deplorables” who will oppose the real new world order. As all this is happening, Trudeau is accelerating Canada’s gun control and gun confiscation efforts to make sure that Canadian citizens have no ability to fight back when the government comes to their homes and kidnaps them, depositing them in Canada’s COVID concentration camps. Americans, on the other hand, will never give up their guns. Count on it."

This corresponds with CDC’s quiet admission that it blended viral and antibody test results for its case numbers and that people can test positive on an antibody test if they have antibodies from a family of viruses that cause the common cold. Hospitals in Florida had so many accuracy complications that Orlando Health had to admit that its 9.4 percent positivity rate got recorded at 98 percent. (READ: The TRUTH About Fauci and Gates And NIH Owning A Stake in the Vaccine).  ADVERTISEMENT  “The groundbreaking peer-reviewed research…asserts that the CDC willfully violated multiple federal laws including the Information Quality Act, Paperwork Reduction Act, and Administrative Procedures Act at minimum. (Publishing Journal – Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge / Public Health Policy Initiative) Most notably, the CDC illegally enacted new rules for data collection and reporting exclusively for COVID-19 that resulted in a 1,600% inflation of current COVID-19 fatality totals,” the watchdog group All Concerned Citizens declared in a statement provided to NATIONAL FILE, referring to the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge study.  “The research demonstrates that the CDC failed to apply for mandatory federal oversight and failed to open a mandatory period for public scientific comment in both instances as is required by federal law before enacting new rules for data collection and reporting. The CDC is required to be in full compliance with all federal laws even during emergency situations. The research asserts that CDC willfully compromised the accuracy and integrity of all COVID-19 case and fatality data from the onset of this crisis in order to fraudulently inflate case and fatality data,” stated All Concerned Citizens.  “On March 24th the CDC published the NVSS COVID-19 Alert No. 2 document instructing medical examiners, coroners and physicians to deemphasize underlying causes of death, also referred to as pre-existing conditions or comorbidities, by recording them in Part II rather than Part I of death certificates as “…the underlying cause of death are expected to result in COVID-19 being the underlying cause of death more often than not.” This was a major rule change for death certificate reporting from the CDC’s 2003 Coroners’ Handbook on Death Registration and Fetal Death Reporting and Physicians’ Handbook on Medical Certification of Death, which have instructed death reporting professionals nationwide to report underlying conditions in Part I for the previous 17 years. This single change resulted in a significant inflation of COVID-19 fatalities by instructing that COVID-19 be listed in Part I of death certificates as a definitive cause of death regardless of confirmatory evidence, rather than listed in Part II as a contributor to death in the presence of pre-existing conditions, as would have been done using the 2003 guidelines. The research draws attention to this key distinction as it has led to a significant inflation in COVID fatality totals. By the researcher’s estimates, COVID-19 recorded fatalities are inflated nationwide by as much as 1600% above what they would be had the CDC used the 2003 handbooks,” stated All Concerned Citizens.  “Then on April 14th, the CDC adopted additional rules exclusive for COVID-19 in violation of federal law by outsourcing data collection rule development to the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), a non-profit entity, again without applying for oversight and opening opportunity for public scientific review. On April 5th the CSTE published a position paper Standardized surveillance case definition and national notification for 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) listing 5 CDC employees as subject matter experts. This key document created new rules for counting probable cases as actual cases without definitive proof of infection (section VII.A1 – pages 4 & 5), new rules for contact tracing allowing contact tracers to practice medicine without a license (section VII.A3 – page 5), and yet refused to define new rules for ensuring that the same person could not be counted multiple times as a new case (section VII.B – page 7),” stated All Concerned Citizens.  ADVERTISEMENT  “By enacting these new rules exclusively for COVID-19 in violation of federal law, the research alleges that the CDC significantly inflated data that has been used by elected officials and public health officials, in conjunction with unproven projection models from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), to justify extended closures for schools, places of worship, entertainment, and small businesses leading to unprecedented emotional and economic hardships nationwide. A formal petition has been sent to the Department of Justice as well as all US Attorneys seeking an immediate grand jury investigation into these allegations,” All Concerned Citizens stated.

Have you printed your boarding pass yet? pic.twitter.com/3HCo5yaImD — Dr. David Samadi, MD (@drdavidsamadi) January 29, 2021  NATIONAL FILE reported: National Institutes of Health (NIH) own a financial stake in the Bill Gates-funded Moderna Coronavirus vaccine, raising big questions about the supposed impartiality of the federal government’s policy decisions during the Coronavirus outbreak. NIAID director Dr. Anthony Fauci, a financial ally of Bill Gates whose institute is part of NIH, has been critical of Hydroxychloroquine and the FBI even raided a health spa serving intravenous vitamin C, which are competitors to a vaccine. (RELATED: Eight NIH Coronavirus Panel Experts Disclose Financial Relationships With Price-Hiking Drugmaker Gilead).  “We do have some particular stake in the intellectual property” for the Moderna vaccine stated Francis Collins, the director of NIH, in a revelatory recent Economic Club panel discussion. “One of the vaccines– the one that’s furthest along– what started, actually, at the federal government in our own Vaccine Research Center at NIH– then worked with a biotechnology company called Moderna to get to where we are now, with very impressive Phase I results and getting ready to go into a large-scale trial as early as July. That one, of course, we do have some particular stake in the intellectual property. Others, though, come from companies who’ve invested their efforts into getting them to the point where they might now be ready for a trial,” Collins stated.  Newly published documents from Public Citizen have massive implications. Public Citizen states:  “The U.S. government may jointly own a potential coronavirus vaccine. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has played a critical role in coronavirus research for years. Building off this work, federal scientists have helped design and test mRNA-1273—a vaccine candidate developed in partnership with Moderna.[2] The federal government has filed multiple patents covering mRNA-1273. In this report, we describe two patent applications that list federal scientists as co-inventors.[3] If the government successfully pursued its patent filings, the resulting patents would likely confer significant rights. We also review recently disclosed contracts between NIH and Moderna. The agreements suggest that NIH has not transferred its rights, but instead maintains a joint stake.”  Journalist Patrick Howley exposes the Coronavirus “Contact Tracing” program in the first-ever episode of NATIONAL FILE TV. Dr. Anthony Fauci funded the Coronavirus bat research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, believed to be the source of the outbreak, then the Political Class tried to suppress treatment as Fauci’s friend and associate Bill Gates prepared mass vaccinations and the economy got battered. And the whole episode was written out, planned, in advance.  Here is the remarkable true story:  Why did the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation fund research at MIT on how to implant people’s vaccination history under their skin? Why did Fauci meet with Bill Gates’ father, George Soros, and other globalist heavyweights all the way back in 2001? Why did the Stephen King-created television series The Dead Zone predict the Coronavirus outbreak — and a Chloroquine cure for it — back in 2003?  Why did Dr. Anthony Fauci’s NIAID fund the Coronavirus bat research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which President Trump and Secretary of State Pompeo and others have identified as the source of the worldwide outbreak?  https://twitter.com/HowleyReporter/status/1247613431617912832  WOW: A high-level source just sent me this photo, says that it shows Dr. FAUCI with George SOROS and Bill Gates' father among others.

It turns out the firm is a partner of Google, NATIONAL FILE has learned. MTX Group got the contract without conservative Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick being “in the loop” to the decision process, and Patrick is just one of numerous policymakers questioning the company’s deal with the state, which authorizes MTX to serve as virus investigators charting people’s contacts and relationships. MTX has also partnered during the Coronavirus outbreak with New York State and built Contact Tracing technology employed in Georgia. So what’s really going on here? It turns out MTX is bigtime partners with Google:  I reported: Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) policy confirms that “Contact Tracing” data may be sent to the World Health Organization (WHO) and to law enforcement authorities “to place someone under quarantine or isolation.” The Contact Tracing records, stored at the CDC and elsewhere, can also be sent to the Department of Justice, State Department, Department of Homeland Security, congressional offices, and to various medical and legal departments and contractors. Democrats are currently seeking $100 billion in a bill that would authorize grants to conduct contact tracing at people’s homes. Meanwhile, Americans are fearing the political implications of contact tracing, considering that Chelsea Clinton is on the board of trustees of one official contact tracing group that has accepted large sums of money from Bill Gates and George Soros organizations.  HHS records show a System of Records Notice (SORN 09-20-0171) in the Federal Register marking the creation of the record system called “Quarantine- and Traveler-Related Activities, Including Records for Contact Tracing Investigation and Notification…” The records pertain to “Individuals subject to quarantine or isolation orders, ill travelers (i.e., passengers and crew), contacts of ill travelers, and/or individuals exposed or suspected of being exposed to serious communicable diseases.” The records include: “Passenger and crew manifests from conveyances carrying individuals subject to 42 CFR parts 70 and 71, case reports, illness response forms, medical assessments, medical records (including but not limited to clinical, hospital and laboratory data and data from other relevant tests), name, address, date of birth, and related information and documents collected for the purpose of carrying out agency responsibilities under sections 311 and 361-368 of the Public Health Services Act.” The records are being stored at: “Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, National Center for the Preparedness, Detection, and Control of Infectious Disease (NCPDCID), Coordinating Center for Infectious Diseases (CCID), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Road, NE., Building 16; MS E03, Atlanta, GA 30333. Records may occasionally be stored at Quarantine Stations located at key ports of entry and at contractor sites.”  READ THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PRIVACY GUIDELINES HERE (emphasis added):  “(1) Records may be disclosed to contractors to handle program work duties, performing many of the same functions as FTEs within DGMQ in situations where additional staff is required.

The March 27 memo written by Joshua D. Lenchus, shortly before he was named chief medical officer this month of Broward Health Medical Center, confirms that the process allows for a “Quarantine Order” to be issued for “Persons Under Investigation” who have not even tested positive. This scoop comes amid public outcry after we exposed Broward County Administrator Bertha Henry caught on tape discussing going into “family homes” and assisted living facilities to isolate people during the Coronavirus outbreak. Freedom protesters wielding petitions were shut out of the Broward Commissioners meeting on Tuesday.  Here is Broward County Administrator Bertha Henry discussing going into “family homes” to isolate people.  HERE IS THE MEMO ISSUED BY JOSHUA LENCHUS: browardorder  SOROS, GATES, AND CLINTONS  Partners in Health was recently selected by Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker to conduct Coronavirus “contact tracing,” a process that involves teams of investigators finding out who infected people have come into contact with. The group is already “training and deploying hundreds of contact tracers.” Some citizens fear the potential for mass surveillance posed by contact tracing, especially in light of a Democrat-introduced bill in Congress to authorize contact tracing “at individuals’ residences.” Partners In Health’s involvement will not assuage many fears, considering the group has received funding from George Soros and Bill Gates organizations and counts Chelsea Clinton on its board of trustees.  Partners in Health lists George Soros’ Open Society Foundations as an official partner, along with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Partners In Health lists Open Society Foundations on its 2015 annual report as a supporter to the tune of $1 million or above, along with the Gates Foundation. Chelsea Clinton serves on Partners in Health’s Board of Trustees, according to its 2019 annual report.  Partners in Health co-founder Paul Farmer’s achievement.org bio notes: “Farmer’s work attracted the support of philanthropists, including George Soros and Bill and Melinda Gates. In 2002, PIH received a $13 million grant from the Global Fund for improvements in the Cange complex. In 2005 the William J. Clinton Foundation funded a Partners in Health AIDS program in Rwanda.” Farmer and Chelsea Clinton did a Clinton Foundation podcast together in 2019.  In response to a 2007 tuberculosis outbreak in Africa, NBC News reported: “Soros’ Open Society Institute announced a $3 million grant to the non-profit organization Partners in Health and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. The donation will be used to design a model project of community-based XDR-TB treatment in Lesotho. Once treatment guidelines are developed, experts hope the program will be adopted in other poor countries.”  Soros personally announced the grant and said he hoped it would spark a larger project. For this initiative, Partners In Health was cited by name in the propaganda book The Philanthropy of George Soros: Building Open Societies.  In 2011, International Women’s Health Coalition noted, “YP Foundation Founder to Join Paul Farmer, George Soros, at IWHC Gala.” Farmer was honored at the gala, which Guest of a Guest noted had David Rockefeller in attendance.  In 2014, Partners In Health co-founder Paul Farmer secured multi-million dollar Soros financing for a coalition project in Africa. Farmer was featured in an October 2014 video interview on Soros’ Open Society Foundations website, which stated, “In between trips to Liberia, Paul Farmer of Partners In Health visited Open Society’s offices to discuss his work on Ebola. Paul talked about the need to ensure sustainable health systems for people in nations where the virus has spread.” Farmer blasted “fear and conspiracy theories around fatal illnesses” in the video and talked about how to “attack” conspiracy theories with activism.  Forbes reported in September 2014: “There’s never been a connection between Ebola and first-rate medical care,” says Paul Farmer, the renowned co-founder of Partners in Health, before pointing out that none of the health care workers flown back to the U.S. for treatment have died. Could the answer to the outbreak lie in the care regiment for those afflicted?  We’ll soon find out. Farmer landed in Liberia this morning, at the center of a coalition quietly formed to specifically – and quickly – test that thesis. In the next few weeks, the Farmer group will open a top-notch treatment facility in one of Liberia’s most rural provinces, along with strategies designed to maximize its effectiveness.  “This has been coming together for years,” Farmer tells Forbes, a few hours before departing on the trip. “The Ebola crisis pushed it over the edge.”  The impetus for this coalition began with a meeting two weeks ago, convened by Farmer’s co-founder at Partners in Health, Jim Kim, who is now president of the World Bank. Attendees included Director-General Margaret Chan of the World Health Organization, Tom Frieden, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Francis Collins, Director of the National Institute for Health. Dismayed by the global response – Kim told the group that the outbreak already ranks among the worst health crises in world history — Kim tabbed Farmer as the World Bank’s special Ebola advisor and also enlisted another attendee at the meeting, Raj Panjabi, who runs Last Mile Health in Liberia. (Full disclosure: Panjabi was mentored at last year’s Forbes 400 Summit on Philanthropy and I now chair the advisory board for Last Mile Health, which hires, trains and manages front-line health care workers in remote villages.)  George Soros’ Open Society Foundations quickly provided $4 million to fund this project. “The coalition got us a proposal the next day, they answered all our questions the day after, and we got them the funds they needed before the week was out,” says Chris Stone, the organization’s president. The project was appealing to Soros’ team because it features a local group familiar with the turf, an entrepreneurial mentality and the ability to scale.”  Forbes passage ends  Contact Tracers Exposed https://t.co/vv5pUJXyOo — Patrick Howley (@HowleyReporter) May 11, 2020  Meanwhile…  Prospective Coronavirus contact tracers in New York City are required to understand “institutional and structural racism” and to support immigrants and the LGBTQ community. The government is employing contact tracers to investigate who infected persons come into contact with, leading to civilian concerns that privacy is being attacked. (RELATED: Democrats Introduce Bill To Authorize Contact Tracing At People’s Homes).  A job posting on Columbia University School of General Studies states: “The Fund for Public Health in New York City (FPHNYC), in partnership with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), is seeking contact tracers to perform case interviews and contact tracing to support the citywide COVID-19 response. using a trauma-informed, culturally respectful approach that builds trust and facilitates the free sharing of information.” The job includes “Conducting in-person investigations into congregate settings and selected cases and contacts.”  Listed requirements include: “Ability to understand the concepts of institutional and structural racism and bias and their impact on underserved and underrepresented communities” and “Have a demonstrated commitment to supporting communities who have experienced systemic oppression and bias (e.g. people of color, LGBTQ people, immigrants, justice involved persons, etc.)”  Democrat Rep. Bobby Rush has introduced a bill in Congress to authorize the federal government to grant approved entities the right to conduct contact tracing for Coronavirus at “individuals’ residences.” Contact tracing involves investigators tracing every interaction that infected people have.  Rep. Rush introduced HR 6666, “COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, and Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act” on May 1, 2020 and it has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The bill has 45 co-sponsors. According to the text of the bill: “To authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID-19, and related activities such as contact tracing, through mobile health units and, as necessary, at individuals’ residences, and for other purposes.”  People are concerned that the government might be angling to use contact tracing to remove people from their homes and place them in quarantine, after a Ventura County, California health official suggested doing just that (and later walked it back, though it’s unclear what his proposed policy actually is at this time).

Graham is fighting Democrat governor Kate Brown’s state government in an effort to re-open her business during the government-imposed Coronavirus lockdown. Graham’s crusade, predictably, is making her a target of the political establishment.  I led the way in exposing Child Protective Services with my 2019 investigative journalism series. I spotlighted the massive problems in Oregon, interviewing pro-life activist Heather Hobbs regarding her claim that a nurse targeted her with a vindictive CPS report in the hospital due to her pro-life conservative beliefs, and I showed how the Oregon Treasury invested in a foster care provider accused of lording over patient abuse.  Meanwhile: Washington state’s Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCFY, also known as “CPS” for “Child Protective Services”) posted a job listing for existing CPS workers to volunteer to supervise children in quarantine centers during the Coronavirus outbreak.  The job posting states: “DCYF is seeking current DCYF employees in King, Snohomish, and Benton counties to volunteer to supervise and support children and youth in Emergency Quarantine Centers. While this is a voluntary effort, you will be compensated four ranges (approximately 20%) above you current base salary while performing these duties, and return to your normal position and salary once concluded. We are looking for current DCYF Social Service Specialist 3’s to care for children who are either COVID-19 positive, or who may have been exposed to COVID-19. There are three locations…”  One of the listed locations, Cedar Springs Camp, clarified that they were falsely listed by the state of Washington as a quarantine center, and they asked the state to remove them. The job posting closed on May 11.  Responding to social media uproar, the Washington state’s DCYF put out a clarifying statement that the ad was only referring to children currently in the system. But their clarifying statement contradicts itself, at first stating that the quarantined children will be kids who have tested positive, and then stating that quarantined children will also be kids who may have been exposed to Coronavirus.  DCYF’s clarifying statement reads: “In light of some concerns from the public regarding two recent job postings by the Washington State Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF), the agency would like to clarify the intent of these job listings and address misinformation spreading as a result of the job description.  The job postings targeted current staff interested in Social Service Specialist 3 and Social Service Specialist 5 positions. The post prematurely included sites of potential locations in the community where we could house children in our legal care and authority who’ve tested positive for COVID-19 in the event that a placement home was not available. The facilities listed are not affiliated with DCYF and had not signed off on this job listing.  The listings have since been taken down to avoid further confusion.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, DCYF began internal recruitment of social service specialists to care for foster children who are either COVID-19 positive or may have been exposed to COVID-19 in the event a placement home was not available.  To clarify, those facilities that ultimately open their doors to this effort would only house State-dependent children and youth in out-of-home care who due to being COVID positive or COVID exposed do not currently have a foster home available. These facilities are for this limited scope and not considered quarantine centers or intended for the general public.”  Meanwhile…  Multiple mothers have had their children taken away from them as a direct result of working in the medical profession during the Coronavirus outbreak. Will these disturbing cases register with our political leaders, who are voicing public calls to stand with our medical workers during the pandemic?  Additionally, NATIONAL FILE caught a Child Protective Services worker attempting to use the Coronavirus outbreak to suspend all visits for parents of a child in the government system, citing a statewide policy that the state government says does not exist. What is going on?  (UPDATE: Dr. Theresa Greene, profiled below, got her children back after an appeals court ruling)  The Washington Examiner previously reported:  “A divorced emergency room physician temporarily lost custody of her daughter because of the coronavirus pandemic.  Dr. Theresa Greene, a doctor in South Florida, previously shared custody of her 4-year-old daughter with her ex-husband, Eric Greene, but a judge granted an emergency order granting him sole custody until the ordeal is over, according to NBC Miami.  In the court’s decision, Circuit Judge Bernard Shapiro wrote, “In order to protect the best interests of the minor child, including but not limited to the minor child’s safety and welfare, this Court temporarily suspends the Former Wife’s timesharing until further Order of Court. The suspension is solely related to the outbreak of COVID-19.”…  …Theresa Greene responded to the judge’s ruling by saying that “the family court system now is stressing me almost more than the virus.”  “I was just shocked that the judge would take this stance without talking to medical experts and knowing the facts and take it so lightly, take my child from me, and not think of the effect on her, her mental and psychological well-being,” she added.  The doctor noted that the custody battle will not stop her from following the “oath” she took to help people.”  Washington Examiner passage ends  Greene appealed the decision, and an appeals court ruled in her favor.  Meanwhile, I recently reported:  An Oklahoma medical worker has been stripped of her parental custody at this time because she works in a medical clinic and could possibly be exposed to Coronavirus during the outbreak, according to court documents.  A district judge for the Sac and Fox District Court took medical worker Katherine Spencer’s children after the father petitioned the court. “The Petitioner alleged, and submitted documents in support, that the Respondent alleged proximity to Coronavirus,” the court order states. Court dockets show no record of a hearing on March 20, the day the court laid down its order to confiscate Spencer’s children.  Katherine Spencer told her story on Facebook and denied that she has any history of “neglect” prior to getting hit with a gag order by the judge.  NATIONAL FILE recently reported…  UPDATE: Since NATIONAL FILE broke this story, the parents in question have had multiple short video visits with their daughter)  A Child Protective Services (CPS) worker in Oklahoma used the Coronavirus outbreak to cut off a mother and father’s visits with their 20-month old daughter, even though the Department of Human Services, the state agency that oversees CPS, claims to be keeping parental visits open.  “DHS statewide has suspended all visitations due to the virus so after today’s visit, we cannot approve any more visitations until it is reinstated,” said CPS permanency worker Danelle Dillman in a Friday morning text message to Andrew Ritter regarding his 20-month old daughter, who was seized by the government for “Failure To Thrive” due to low infant birth weight after the girl’s mother chose to breastfeed her. Ritter and his wife said they preferred not to place their daughter on a particular appetite enhancer due to perceived conflict with the girl’s Zyrtec Antihistemine.  An Oklahoma DHS official told National File in a confusing, defensive interview that the state agency does not have a policy in place to suspend all visitations at this time, but rather to continue visitations using technology like Skype and FaceTime. But the official does not know if visitations are actually still occurring. Ritter and his wife never received an offer to hold a cyber-visit. Here is the text that permanency worker Dillman sent to Ritter:  When National File called up the headquarters for Oklahoma DHS, a woman who answered the phone told us that parental visits were indeed “suspended” for the time being, “until they get this virus under control.” The woman refused to give us her name.  But Keeley McEwan, head of the Oklahoma DHS communications office, told National File that “We have not suspended visitation across the board in any way.” She pointed to the agency’s daily guidance for case workers, which she noted is “fluid” and “changes day to day.”  “As of today we are highly encouraging continuing visitation” utilizing iphones and programs including Skype and FaceTime. “Whether a visitation is cancelled is on a case by case basis.”  She did not know whether any visitations have been recently held since the Coronavirus outbreak using Skype or FaceTime. Permanency worker Danelle Dillman did not respond to repeated requests for comment. McEwan did not confirm whether or not she spoke to Dillman or Dillman’s superviser following our conversation.  I have been reporting on the nationwide scourge of CPS removing children from parents’ homes for highly disputable reasons or no reason at all, which many parents feel is due to the for-profit nature of the government’s child removal industry.  BUSTED: FAUCI, BIRX, AND GATES: HERE IS MY ORIGINAL REPORT THAT CHANGED THE WORLD  President Donald Trump is fighting to find a medical solution for Coronavirus in the short term, expressing hope that the anti-malaria drug Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine can help patients suffering from the Chinese virus.  The truth is that President Donald Trump is locked in an intense power struggle with Bill Gates, who is pushing his vaccines, which may not be available to the public until after November’s election.  Gates has a lot of pull in the medical world, he has a multi-million dollar relationship with Dr. Fauci, and Fauci originally took the Gates line supporting vaccines and casting doubt on Chloroquine. Coronavirus response team member Dr. Deborah Birx, appointed by former president Obama to serve as United States Global AIDS Coordinator, also sits on the board of a group that has received billions from Gates’ foundation. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently provided funding to both IHME and Imperial College London, which put out wildly overblown models for the Coronavirus outbreak that caused mass panic and contributed to worldwide government lockdown. Gates is a big proponent for a population lockdown scenario for the Coronavirus outbreak.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID, a division of National Institutes of Health, NIH) director Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is represented by the Aurumn Speakers Bureau, initially criticized Trump’s hopeful assessment of Chloroquine, saying in an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper that “There’s no magic drug for coronavirus right now,” and lectured, “Let me put it into perspective for the viewers .. there has been anecdotal non-proven data that it [chloroquine] works… but when you have an uncontrolled trial you can never definitely say that it works.”  Fauci then changed his tune and launched a public relations campaign huddling closer to Trump. Fauci said that he would definitely prescribe Chloroquine for patients. “Yeah, of course, particularly if people have no other option. These drugs are approved drugs for other reasons. They’re anti-malaria drugs, and they’re drugs against certain autoimmune diseases like lupus. Physicians throughout the country can prescribe that in an off-label way. Which means they can write it for something it was not approved for.”  Fauci makes his hostility toward the Trump-touted drugs clear:  First of all this is a brilliant idea @kilmeade to study how many people that’ve taken hydroxychloroquine long term have contracted #COVID maybe even have them take antibody test. Second of all Fauci doesn’t want it prescribed here but it’s fine if Spain does? pic.twitter.com/hcnRhos13g — Rosie memos (@almostjingo) April 3, 2020  Fauci is pushing the talking point that things will never go back to normal in our society until we have the ability to mass-vaccinate people, echoing Bill Gates’ assertion that mass gatherings in our culture “may not come back at all” before mass-vaccinations.  #NEW: Dr. Anthony Fauci on return to normalcy from pandemic: ""If 'back to normal' means acting like there never was a Coronavirus problem, I don't think that's going to happen until we do have a situation where you can completely protect the population.""pic.twitter.com/JbE7uasbO2 — Jennifer Franco (@jennfranconews) April 6, 2020  Fauci downplayed the threat of Coronavirus on January 21 in a Newsmax TV interview, saying, “This is not a major threat for the people in the United States, and this is not something that the citizens of the United States right now should be worried about.” Since then, Coronavirus has exploded in the United States, boosting demand for a vaccine.

The People Demand Ithttps://t.co/J4SSXn1kPB — Patrick Howley (@HowleyReporter) April 12, 2020  But Fauci’s NIAID actually funded a study on Bat Coronavirus, which was a project that included scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the Chinese lab at the center of controversy over their bat research. That study confirmed in 2018 that humans have died from coronavirus.  Here’s an excerpt from the April 4, 2018 NIAID website entry entitled “New Coronavirus Emerges From Bats in China, Devastates Young Swine”: “A newly identified coronavirus that killed nearly 25,000 piglets in 2016-17 in China emerged from horseshoe bats near the origin of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which emerged in 2002 in the same bat species. The new virus is named swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV). It does not appear to infect people, unlike SARS-CoV which infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774. No SARS-CoV cases have been identified since 2004. The study investigators identified SADS-CoV on four pig farms in China’s Guangdong Province. The work was a collaboration among scientists from EcoHealth Alliance, Duke-NUS Medical School, Wuhan Institute of Virology and other organizations, and was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health. The research is published in the journal Nature. The researchers say the finding is an important reminder that identifying new viruses in animals and quickly determining their potential to infect people is a key way to reduce global health threats.”  Additionally, the Daily Mail reported that National Institutes of Health, of which Fauci’s NIAID is a member, provided a $3.7 million grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology to study bat-borne coronavirus. That study was headlined, ‘Discovery of a rich gene pool of bat SARS-related coronaviruses provides new insights into the origin of SARS coronavirus.’  So what is really going on here?  The true behind-the-scenes story is coming to light:  Bill Gates Cast Doubt on Chloroquine And Said He Is Running A Study On It  Here is what Gates said regarding Chloroquine in a Reddit Ask Me Anything session:  “There are a lot of therapeutic drugs being examined. This is one of many but it is not proven. If it works we will need to make sure the finite supplies are held for the patients who need it most. We have a study going on to figure this out. We also have a screening effort to look at all the ideas for Therapeutics because the number being proposed is very large and only the most promising should be tried in patients. China was testing some things but now they have so few cases that that testing needs to move to other locations,” Gates said.  Gates Is Funding Coronavirus Vaccine Candidates That Would Compete With Chloroquine, And Dr. Fauci’s Agency Is Co-Partnering On The Project  The company Moderna is working on a Coronavirus vaccine, which they expect will go into clinical trials in April. Dr. Fauci has heaped praise on Moderna and said that a vaccine is the only way to definitively assure the end of the virus. Gates is working on multiple Coronavirus vaccine projects.  The New Eastern Outlook journal reported:  “Gates Foundation money is backing vaccine development on every front. Inovio Pharmaceuticals of Pennsylvania received $9 million from the Gates-backed CEPI, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, to develop a vaccine, INO-4800, which is about to test on humans in April, a suspiciously rapid time frame. In addition Gates Foundation just gave the company an added $5 million to develop a proprietary smart device for intradermal delivery of the new vaccine.  In addition Gates Foundation monies via CEPI are financing development of a radical new vaccine method known as messengerRNA or mRNA.  They are co-funding the Cambridge, Massachusetts biotech company, Moderna Inc., to develop a vaccine against the Wuhan novel coronavirus, now called SARS-CoV-2. Moderna’s other partner is the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Head of NIAID is Dr Anthony Fauci, the person at the center of the Trump Administration virus emergency response. Notable about the Fauci-Gates Moderna coronavirus vaccine, mRNA-1273, is that it has been rolled out in a matter of weeks, not years, and on February 24 went directly to Fauci’s NIH for tests on human guinea pigs, not on mice as normal. Moderna’s chief medical adviser, Tal Zaks, argued, “I don’t think proving this in an animal model is on the critical path to getting this to a clinical trial…  Add to this the fact that the Gates Foundation and related entities such as CEPI constitute the largest funders of the public-private entity known as WHO, and that its current director, Tedros Adhanom, the first WHO director in history not a medical doctor, worked for years on HIV with the Gates Foundation when Tedros was a government minister in Ethiopia, and we see that there is practically no area of the current coronavirus pandemic where the footprints of the omnipresent Gates are not to be found. If that is to the good of mankind or grounds to be worried, time will tell.”  New Eastern Outlook journal passage ends  The Hill reported:  “Going into a Phase One trial within three months of getting the sequence is unquestionably the world indoor record. Nothing has ever gone that fast,” according to Fauci.  While it is uncertain that Moderna’s answer is the solution, Fauci notes that the only surefire way to stop an outbreak is to develop a vaccine. Moderna manufactures drugs around messenger RNA molecules that carry instructions to reprogram cells in the body to operate differently and beneficially. Currently, its genetic technology has not created a vaccine for humans.  The first study of the vaccine will take place at NIAID. If it is successful, a second trial would feature closer to hundreds of people. Pending the results of future studies and regulations, the vaccine may not be readily available until next year, Fauci said.  Hill passage ends  Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News reported in 2016 on Gates’ relationship with Moderna:  “Moderna Therapeutics said today it received an initial $20 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a new affordable combination of messenger RNA–based antibody therapeutics geared toward preventing HIV infection.  The grant is intended for use in the antibody combination’s preclinical study and a Phase I clinical trial. Gates Foundation’s $20 million funding could potentially grow into a total $100 million commitment—including the HIV antibody project—toward development of additional mRNA-based treatments for various infectious diseases, Moderna said.  “The foundation’s mission to help all people lead healthy and productive lives is well aligned with Moderna’s mission to deliver on the promise of transformative mRNA science to bring new medicines to patients,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a statement.  Moderna said the development effort would be led by its infectious disease–focused venture company, Valera…”  Fauci Is Tight with Bill Gates  “He’s very good about not overpromising,” Gates said of Fauci in 2018 as Gates worked on a universal flu vaccine. NIAID Council minutes from 2019 show Fauci’s agency identifying a Gates Foundation workshop as being of interest. Gates met with Fauci in 2017 “to discuss research opportunities in global health.” In 2010, Fauci was named to the Leadership Council of the “Decade of Vaccines” Collaboration, which the World Health Organization, Fauci’s agency NIAID, UNICEF, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation convened.  Fauci delivered a keynote opening address on “The Challenge of Pandemic Preparedness” in Washington, D.C. at the October 2, 2017 Grand Challenges meeting, which is a project of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (Gates Foundation) will also contribute $100 million to the goal of advancing these potential cures, with an aim toward providing affordable, globally available treatment that will be accessible to patients in low-resource settings.  According to the NIH, the collaboration between the organizations will focus on 2 key areas. First, it will identify potential candidate cures for preclinical and clinical evaluation, and second, it will define long-term opportunities to partner with organizations in Africa…  “This collaboration is an ambitious step forward, harnessing the most cutting-edge scientific tools and NIH’s sizable global HIV research infrastructure to one day deliver a cure and end the global HIV pandemic,” said NIAID director Anthony S. Fauci, MD, in a statement announcing the initiative. “We are taking into account those with the greatest need at the foundation of this effort, to ensure that, if realized, this exceptional public health achievement will be made accessible to all.”  Dr. Fauci Is Slated to Speak At The World Vaccine Congress in September 2020 Alongside A Coterie of Public Sector and Private Sector Folks From WHO, CDC, FDA, Merck, Pfizer, etc.  The event is in Washington, D.C.

FAUCI’S FRIEND PELOSI GALLIVANTED AROUND CHINATOWN DURING THE OUTBREAK  Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi impeached President Donald Trump during the spread of the Coronavirus outbreak in the United States of America, while also encouraging people to socialize with her in the Chinatown district of San Francisco, where she visited a fortune cookie factory to portray her supposed opposition to bigotry and xenophobia.  The CDC confirmed the first U.S. case of the Chinese virus on January 21, in Seattle from a man who got back from Wuhan, China. Incidentally, the House impeachment managers kicked off opening arguments in the Trump “Ukraine”-focused impeachment trial two days later on January 23.  Pelosi told people to “Come join us!” during her Chinatown jaunt on February 24, which featured her aforementioned fortune cookie factory visit.  This was on February 24.

National File reported:  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s 1,119 page coronavirus stimulus proposal includes a vast amount of hidden, nakedly partisan political provisions and regulations that are unrelated to family and small business relief. Several sharp-eyed social media users who had the fortitude to browse through the massive bill found bizarre provisions, including writer Rachel Bovard. “Pelosi’s #COVID19 bill is 1,119 pages and contains provisions for “conducting risk-limiting audits of results of elections” so yeah it’s really very focused on the crisis at hand,” Bovard said in a thread that compiled screenshots of various provisions in the bill. After proposing a bailout for the postal service, the Democratic bill includes sections about paid studies of “pay equity” between “racial and ethnic minorities” and their “white counterparts,” as well as a “comparison of pay between and women for similar roles and assignments.”  GATES IS EVERYWHERE  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently provided massive amounts of funding to both the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) and Imperial College in London, which both produced wildly incorrect models for the Coronavirus outbreak that sparked worldwide panic and provided false justification for government leaders to shut down the American economy, creating mass unemployment. Bill Gates is a vaccine oligarch who recently laughed at America’s economic devastation, so committed he is to his vision of vaccinating the world’s population and keeping society locked down until that becomes possible. Gates, like his crony Dr. Anthony Fauci, has fought the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat the virus and has claimed that society will never fully return to normal until a vaccine is ready. (READ: The Dark Truth About Fauci, Birx, Bill Gates and the Globalist Elites).  White House Coronavirus task force member Dr. Deborah Birx touted the IHME’s “Chris Murray Model” in April. IHME is housed at the University of Washington and was reportedly founded by the Gates Foundation, according to a Fox 9 report. In 2017, the Gates Foundation provided a ten-year, $279 million grant to IHME. Birx, meanwhile, sits on the board of the Global Fund, which has received more than $2 billion from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The IHME model proved to be a total disaster. In Georgia, where Republican governor Brian Kemp led the charge for re-opening his state, the model previously predicted 1,783 new cases per day on June 12 and hundreds of new cases per day into August. That model, just revised, shows 367 new cases per day on June 12 and zero new cases per day by August.  Deborah Birx, whose PA medical license is expired, used a bogus Gates-funded model to shut down the country, defended counting non-definitive cases as Coronavirus, sits on board of Global Fund which has taken more than $2 BILLION from Gates Foundation…https://t.co/DhgcEibTdD — Patrick Howley (@HowleyReporter) April 21, 2020  In March 2020, during the Coronavirus outbreak, the Gates Foundation awarded a more than $79 million grant to Imperial College London. The Imperial College London model, spearheaded by team leader Neil Ferguson, projected 2.2 million American casualties. The disastrous model led to Elon Musk lambasting Ferguson, who resigned as an adviser to the British government when he was caught flaunting the very lockdown that his numbers inspired. Imperial College London admits on its website that its research on arboviruses, which includes work on vaccine projections undertaken by Neil Ferguson himself is Gates-funded, stating, “Our research is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the US National Institutes of Health and the MRC.” Business Insider reports that Neil Ferguson’s MRC Center for Global Infectious Disease at Imperial College “gets tens of millions of dollars in annual funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and works with the UK National Health Service, the US Centres for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), and is tasked with supplying the World Health Organization with “rapid analysis of urgent infectious disease problems.” A job posting that opened in December 2019 and closed in January 2020 stated (emphasis added): “We are seeking an outstanding Research Lead for the Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium (https://www.vaccineimpact.org/). This major collaborative initiative directed by Professor Neil Ferguson, is based within the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London and funded jointly by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance ($11 million over 2016-22).”  A Chinese government entity that has partnered with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation led a delegation of public health experts to the Wuhan Institute of Virology in December 2018, after the lab had already begun its bat coronavirus research funded by Dr. Anthony Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). This discovery was made by citizen journalist Amazing Polly (@99freemind). President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have emboldened the narrative that Coronavirus originated at the Wuhan lab.  The Chinese government’s Center for Global Public Health (CGPH) guided ten experts from Africa to the Wuhan lab and other Chinese institutions and reached a consensus on “training of biosafety personnel.” The information on the trip from Wuhan Institute of Virology’s website can be READ HERE. According to the website, “CGPH has managed and implemented foreign aid mission assigned by the National Health and Family Planning Commission and the Ministry of Commerce, as well as international cooperation projects funded by the United Kingdom Department for International Development and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.”"

The time to test that theory has come. This coming December, to mark the 55th anniversary of Mr. Disney’s passing, The Cryonics Institute will set in motion reanimation procedures.  This whole event will be captured and recorded in a variety of ways. There will also be a live feed to see if Walt does wake up immediately. Sources inside The Cryonics Institute says it will take up to a week to know for sure if their efforts will have been successful.  Not Only did Walt hope for a cure, but he was also obsessed with what the world would be like in the future. With the immense amount of changes that have occurred since his passing, we suspect there will be a steep learning curve, but who better than Mr. Disney himself to navigate this new world. It’s really a small world after all.  Daily News Reported has made an agreement with the Disney family, that they will be the first to have an opportunity to interview Walt Disney upon his full recovery."

Additionally, the UK would form closer alliances with 11 current members including Australia, Canada, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore.  In a report for the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), Conservative MP Anthony Mangnall points out that membership could see the proportion of UK exports eligible for tariff-free access rising from 85.4% to 99.9%, with the potential to boost GDP by up to £20billion a year if the US joined the CPTPP before the UK managed to agree a bilateral FTA with Washington.  “CPTPP offers a huge opportunity for Britain,” he writes. “The benefits of joining are clear – an economic boost to the whole of the UK, geo-political support to our allies and the development and standardisation of global trade rules.  “Our membership to CPTPP does not reduce our high standards or strip away our sovereignty [but] seeks to raise standards and provides a platform for the UK to play a leading role in shaping the future of trade.”  Foreign Secretary Liz Truss made becoming a member of the CPTPP a key priority for the UK in her previous role as International Trade Secretary.

The U.K. Sun reported that this claim was made by Giuffre in a manuscript of a book called “The Billionaire’s Playboy Club.” Giuffre wrote that Maxwell “enjoyed to boast about her rendezvous with numerous lovers”.  “When she came back giddy as a schoolgirl with an explosion of news, with all the develop up and enjoyment in her voice you ‘d think she was the next crown princess,” Giuffre composed. “But she had actually offered George Cooney a b ***** b in the restroom at some random occasion. She never let that one down.”  Clooney has yet to talk about the claims made by Giuffre, who has actually also claimed that she was required to have sex with Prince Andrew on three different occasions. In this exact same manuscript, Giuffre explained the supposed fetishes of the British royal.  “He liked my feet and even licked in between my toes,”Giuffre wrote of Andrew. Nevertheless, she went on to claim that “there was the lack of passion in the intimacy we shared, to him I was simply another lady, and to me, he was simply another job.”Epstein committed suicide in federal custody last summer while awaiting trial on various sex charges. Maxwell was jailed last month, and she has actually been remanded to a prison in New york city City up until her trial, which is arranged to occur next July.

107,107,true/false,"A team of scientists from Canada have identified at least 13 strains of cannabis sativa they believe can aid in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The President of the United States of America has spent the past few weeks touting a dangerous drug called hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic treatment for COVID-19. Unfortunately, the president’s expertise is in reality TV, not medicine. Several studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine, a drug designed to treat malaria, has dangerous side-effects when used to treat coronavirus, including death. The quest for a COVID-19 drug that will both make Donald Trump and his friends in the pharmaceutical industry rich and not kill the people who take it has, so far, netted no results. But exciting government-sponsored research out of Canada seems to indicate a different approach is in order. Per the team’s research paper: “ We have developed over 800 new Cannabis sativa lines and extracts and hypothesized that high-CBD C. sativa extracts may be used to modulate ACE2 expression in COVID-19 target tissues. Screening C. sativa extracts using artificial human 3D models of oral, airway, and intestinal tissues, we identified 13 high CBD C. sativa extracts that modulate ACE2 gene expression and ACE2 protein levels. Our initial data suggest that some C. sativa extract down-regulate serine protease TMPRSS2, another critical protein required for SARS-CoV2 entry into host cells. What this means is the team has carefully developed several cannabis strains that have been experimentally shown to make it significantly more difficult for the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus to find a home inside of the tissue cells it latches onto in order to infect us with the COVID-19 disease. It does not mean you should run out to your local dispensary and exhaust their sativa and CBD supply. The 13 strains cultivated by the researchers are almost certainly very different from whatever wacky-named strains you’re going to purchase over the counter. But, if you must take an untested treatment, I recommend taking Canada‘s lead and legally imbibing cannabis instead of listening to the Trump administration. A recent study led by Harvard Medical School professor Mandeep Mehra which looked at data from more than 96,000 COVID-19 patients, 15,000 of which had been treated with hydroxychloroquine, clearly showed that patients using the drug were at far greater risk for death than those who did not. Per a report from the Washington Post: “ For those given hydroxychloroquine, there was a 34 percent increase in risk of mortality and a 137 percent increased risk of a serious heart arrhythmias. For those receiving hydroxychloroquine and an antibiotic — the cocktail endorsed by Trump — there was a 45 percent increased risk of death and a 411 percent increased risk of serious heart arrhythmias. Those given chloroquine had a 37 percent increased risk of death and a 256 percent increased risk of serious heart arrhythmias. For those taking chloroquine and an antibiotic, there was a 37 percent increased risk of death and a 301 percent increased risk of serious heart arrhythmias. Donald Trump recently told reporters and the US public that he’d been taking hydroxycholoroquine as a preventative measure to ward off COVID-19. Excepting the fact he has a small financial stake in Plaquenil – the drug name for hydroxycholoroquine — if he really wants to prevent COVID-19 he should imbibe cannabis. There’s no peer-reviewed evidence showing it’ll work, but at least it won’t kill him. Not only has no one ever died from imbibing cannabis, it has clear medical benefits for the prevention and treatment of diseases ranging from viral infections to cancer. That, and he might be less of an asshole if he smoked a joint every now and again. For more information on the cannabis study, check out the full pre-print research paper here. And if you want to know more about why nobody should use hydroxycholorquine to prevent or treat COVID-19, please read this important study. People with lung cancer are dying after being diagnosed late in A&E because their GP missed signs of the disease despite often repeated visits, experts have revealed. As many as 56% of people in some parts of England who get lung cancer are only diagnosed when they visit A&E, according to a report by the UK Lung Cancer Coalition. They are five times more likely to die within a year than those whose condition has been identified either by their GP or through the NHS cancer screening programme. Family doctors often fail to diagnose cases of lung cancer until it is too late to treat effectively or miss them altogether, leading patients to seek help at A&E, the report says. More than a third of lung cancer patients see their GP three or more times before being referred for tests. That is a key factor in the UK’s poor record, in international terms, at diagnosing the disease early. Lung cancer is the third commonest form of cancer in the UK and the biggest cancer killer, claiming 35,000 lives a year. “People diagnosed in A&E are dying as a result of delays in identifying their illness. Late diagnosis makes lung cancer harder to treat and is a major reason why we have such poor survival in the UK,” said Prof Mick Peake, chair of the coalition’s clinical advisory group. It is “a travesty” that admission to hospital as a medical emergency is the single commonest way the disease is diagnosed, added Peake, who is also the clinical director of the Centre for Cancer Outcomes at University College Hospital London. GPs’ failure to spot symptoms of lung cancer is only one reason for Britain’s low rate of early diagnosis and high rate of lung cancer mortality, Peake stressed. However, he added: “There is good evidence that there are missed opportunities for earlier diagnosis in primary care and we strongly urge GPs to have a low threshold for doing a chest X-ray or CT scan in patients where there is any suspicion of lung cancer.” Patients’ reluctance to have symptoms, such as a persistent cough, checked out can delay diagnosis too, especially those from poorer households and older people. NHS data cited by Peake shows a postcode lottery in which Tower Hamlets in east London has the highest proportion of patients whose disease is diagnosed in A&E – 56.2% – closely followed by Manchester 56.1% and Leeds south and east 54%. More than 50% of patients are also diagnosed in A&E in Salford, Hull, South Tyneside and Sunderland. In contrast, only 14.7% of sufferers in Guildford and Waverley in Surrey are diagnosed that way, with low rates also in Wokingham in Berkshire 15.7% and Harrogate 16%. Dr Moira Fraser-Pearce, director of policy, campaigns and influence at Macmillan Cancer Support, said that staff shortages in NHS cancer services and heavy workloads were exacerbating the complex reasons for the high level of diagnosis in A&E. Macmillan has helped NHS England develop a new way of screening smokers and other high-risk patients for lung cancer by offering tests in trucks, often situated in supermarket car parks. The NHS did not comment directly on the findings but a spokesperson said that: “The NHS is catching more cancers earlier when they are easier to treat, resulting in record lung cancer survival rates.” Targeted lung health checks in locations such as supermarket car parks will detect “thousands more cases of cancer that might not have been detected otherwise, saving even more lives”, they added. NHS England has pledged to diagnose three in four cases of cancer at an early stage by 2028. Currently 57% of lung cancers are diagnosed late, greatly reducing chance of survival."

However, this represents only .26% of the Georgia ballots. When extrapolating to the entire state, this equals more than 14,000 votes and Georgia was stolen by only 10,000 votes by Biden.

Los Angeles, CA- Early Sunday morning Henry Franklin Winkler passed away from pneumonia exacerbated by his diagnosis of Guillain-Barré Syndrome GBS. Winkler rose to fame as Arthur “Fonzie” Fonzarelli on the hit TV show Happy Days in the 70’s and 80’s.  Winkler had steadily been working in Hollywood up until his death. He was a respected actor and a joy to work worth, according to insiders. There is no known cause of GBS Guillain-Barré Syndrome, but there have been links to digestive track infections days or weeks prior to the onset of GBS. Winkler had been to see Dr. Gregory House the week prior to his passing for abdominal pain and was told to relax and lay off “spicy foods”.  Winkler with the cast of Happy Days.  Winkler had been battling GBS in secret for 2yrs. It is said that he wanted to keep his diagnosis secret so that he would not be treated differently. He never wanted any special attention and was always ready to help others at the drop of the hat.  A planned Happy Days reunion show will now have to go on without Arthur Fonzarelli. It is said that there is to be a special “Arthur Fonzarelli Day”, on the show in celebration of the character and his impact on pop culture. Henry Winkler will be missed."
110,110,true/false,"Military Arrests James Comey The U.S. military has arrested disgraced former FBI Director James Comey on charges of treason, sedition, obstruction of justice, and aiding and abetting persons actively involved in criminal behavior, Real Raw News has learned.  Donald J. Trump greenlit the Tuesday morning raid on Comey’s lavish, suburban home after speaking to Marine Corps Col. John Lynch, commanding officer of the Marine Raider regiment at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Col. Lynch committed at least two 4-man squads to the mission, said a confidential source involved in Trump’s quest to depose Joseph Biden and restore America to the people.  On Tuesday at about 3:00 a.m., U.S. Marines operating on Donald Trump’s authority stormed Comey’s seven-bedroom, 10,700-sqaure-foot mansion in McClean, Virginia. Although most operational details are classified, our source said Raiders surprised Comey, who was half-asleep in bed, and apprehended him after he reached for a pistol underneath a pillow. Before he could palm the weapon, a Marine charged forward and struck Comey’s forehead with the butt of his rifle, rendering Comey unconscious.  “Trump’s people had digital surveillance on the Comey residence for quite a long time. They knew Comey’s wife, Patrice, would be out of town on personal business, and none of the kids would be around visiting. Trump’s been anticipating this moment a long time; it’s a day of reckoning,” our source said.  Trump, our source added, had authored a sealed indictment on Comey shortly after firing him on May 9, 2017. He had obtained irrefutable evidence proving that Comey, an Obama holdover, had been on Clinton’s payroll and, on her authority, tried to slander the president by linking the Trump campaign to Russian interference in the 2016 election. Moreover, Trump had obtained a 2015 audio recording in which Comey told Hillary Clinton he would “do whatever it takes, no matter what” to scuttle Trump’s bid for the presidency. Additionally, Trump learned that Comey’s faux investigation into Clinton’s handling of confidential emails was merely for effect, optics to avoid the appearance of impropriety and bias.  “Comey is criminal scum. He doesn’t have a modicum of decency. Trump also has the goods on him for wiretapping Trump Tower. Comey’s been taken to a secure holding pending transportation to GITMO, where he’ll face a military tribunal. One thing that’ll come out is that when Comey got hold of Anthony Weiner’s laptop, he found videos of Huma Abedin and Hillary Clinton doing some pretty terrible things to kids. Comey kept that info from the public, probably at Clinton’s request,” our source said.  In closing, we asked our source why, with so many arrests dropping, family and friends of the accused haven’t complained to CNN or MSNBC about their loved ones being abducted in the dead of night.  “The only explanation is the Deep State is keeping them silent,” our source said. “If it became officially known that people like Clinton, Podesta, Abedin, and now Comey have been nabbed by the military, it would weaken the Deep State’s hold on society—because it would show they are losing. And the Deep Staters always want to give the appearance of winning. They won’t be able to for much longer.”  (Visited 150,672 times, 6 visits today)"
111,111,true/false,"Workplace reforms 'will protect gig economy workers' Image copyright Getty Images  Workers on zero-hour contracts, agency employees or gig economy workers are to be better protected by a package of workplace reforms, the government says.  Under new legislation to be introduced on Monday, staff would have to be told details of their rights from their first day in a job, including eligibility for paid and sick leave.  Workers would also be given the right to request more predictable hours.  But Labour and the unions say the planned reforms do not go far enough.  The reforms are based on the findings of a review into modern working practices led by Matthew Taylor, a former aide to ex-PM Tony Blair and chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts.  Ministers say the new legislation will:  close a loophole that had allowed agency staff to be paid less than permanent employees  ensure firms will have to provide a statement of rights on the first day of a person's employment, setting out what paid leave they are entitled to, including for illness, maternity and paternity leave  increase the maximum fine employers face at a tribunal from £5,000 to £20,000, if they are found to have demonstrated malice, spite or gross oversight  ensure that companies will have to calculate holiday pay based on 52 weeks, as opposed to 12 weeks, so people in seasonal or atypical roles get the paid time off they are entitled to  Business Secretary Greg Clark said: Today's largest upgrade in workers' rights in over a generation is a key part of building a labour market that continues to reward people for hard work, that celebrates good employers and is boosting productivity and earning potential across the UK.  However, Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: The right to request guaranteed working hours is no right all.  Zero-hours contract workers will have no more leverage than Oliver Twist.   Unless unions get the right to organise and bargain for workers in places like Uber and Amazon, too many working people will continue to be treated like disposable labour, she added.  Image copyright Getty Images  Matthew Fell, chief UK policy director at the CBI, said: [Businesses] welcome a new law giving all workers the right to request more predictable working hours, which will help to facilitate the conversations that are essential to ensuring flexibility benefits both parties.  But he said: Legislation to amend employment status rules risks making the law less able to adapt to new forms of work in the future.  The government agrees with the Taylor review that completely banning zero-hour contracts would negatively impact more people than it helped.  It also said that platform-based working - including the likes of ride-sharing app Uber or food delivery business Deliveroo - offers genuine two-way flexibility for firms and workers.  Zero-hour contracts, where an employer does not have to offer work and an employee has no obligation to work when asked, are highly controversial.  The Archbishop of Canterbury called the contracts the reincarnation of an ancient evil."

Read our full Disclosure here  48,175 views  It’s official.  This is now fact, not speculation.  More people have died from the COVID-19 vaccine than from all other vaccines over the last 20 years… COMBINED.  That’s right: the vaccine that is supposed to “protect” you from COVID is now responsible for killing more people than all the other vaccines put together.  Does that make you feel safe yet?  This isn’t our calculation.  This number has been confirmed by the CDC itself.  More details on this alarming new figure below:  ""There have been nearly as many deaths from complications following inoculation with the so-called Covid-19 “vaccines” as there have been for all previous vaccines total since Jan. 1, 2001.""https://t.co/gIrHPDMiwq — Proud Neanderthal. Remember Nov 3 2020. (@mossback72) May 10, 2021  FYI, according to CDC more people died from Covid-19 vaccine reactions than all vaccine's combined over the past 20 years pic.twitter.com/xa1hSDUYl2 — Wayne (@Wayne33636206) May 8, 2021  We’ve been told again and again that the vaccine is safe.  We’ve also been told to trust the science and to trust the experts.  Well… now the scientific experts at the CDC are telling us the vaccine is deadlier than all the other vaccines!  WND has a breakdown of the CDC’s revealing statement on their website:  There have been nearly as many deaths from complications following inoculation with the so-called Covid-19 “vaccines” as there have been for all previous vaccines total since Jan. 1, 2001. In fact, the data are five days old so the gap, which was at four on May 3, has almost certainly been bridged. According to the CDC website: “Over 245 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from Dec. 14, 2020, through May 3, 2021. During this time, VAERS received 4,178 reports of death (0.0017%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. CDC and FDA physicians review each case report of death as soon as notified and CDC requests medical records to further assess reports.” The website went on to boldly proclaim that a “review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines.” This is important medical editorializing so as not to scare people. The CDC has a vested interest in getting as many people vaccinated as possible, so even when burying the important data about deaths at the bottom of a page intended to assuage concerns over these experimental drugs, they did so with every intention of making people take it.  Of course, the concern over the vaccine is nothing new.  Fox News’ Tucker Carlson has been raising legitimate questions.  However, after a segment last week questioning the vaccine, Carlson’s segment was BANNED from YouTube.  Fortunately, people have been ripping the segment and sharing it online.  Watch it below before Big Tech takes it down again:  On this occasion, full marks to Fox News, but it is obviously an exception.  Carlson makes the point that in 4 months of Covid ""vaccines"", the 3,000+ deaths is greater than with all other vaccines in the previous 15 years. No official investigation!https://t.co/iebMBd30eF — Dr Verner Wheelock (@VernersViews) May 6, 2021  Tucker Carlson on the experimental vaccines pic.twitter.com/IZRtcYlGdx — Rima Kohli (@OrganicQuotient) May 4, 2021  More and more people are raising questions.  As they should.  But similar to the 2020 presidential election, rather than answering these questions with transparency and integrity, people are refusing to talk about the numbers.  Fortunately for us, the numbers speak for themselves.  Conservative commentator David J. Harris, Jr. had this to say:  On Wednesday night’s episode of Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” host Tucker Carlson asked a very important question: “How many Americans have died after taking the COVID vaccines? Not Americans who’ve been killed by the virus, that’s a huge number, but how many Americans have died after getting the vaccines designed to prevent the virus? Do you know the answer to that question? Do you know anything about the downside? We know a lot about the upside of the vaccine. We’ve been completely in favor of vulnerable people taking vaccines.” With our federal government teetering on the edge of going full authoritarian concerning getting the COVID vaccine, do you know all the risks involved? President Joe Biden was on television Tuesday talking about vaccines, about how he wants us all to get one. In fact, everyone with authority wants you to get the COVID vaccine and they are starting to apply enormous pressure for people like me who have been holding out to get the shot. The Biden administration has said that they won’t force COVID vaccine passports or anything like that but when he said that Dr. Fauci also indicated, or was it a dog whistle, to institutions and corporations that they would start using some form of a COVID vaccine passport to let you into the building or use their services. You may not be able to fly on an airplane or go to work or even educate your children if you don’t get the vaccine. Friends and family members may tell you that you’re not welcome at their homes or events if you have not yet been vaccinated. Okay, so a lot of you are contemplating on getting the vaccine because you don’t want to have to deal with the immense pressure being applied on you, but before you get that shot, do you know anything at all about the possible risks of getting the shot? You probably don’t know what I’m about to tell you, and you should know because it’s your life we’re talking about. People don’t normally associate vaccines with causing serious problems, even fatalities, because vaccines for the most part are not dangerous, at least according to the numbers. About 160 million Americans get the flu shot each year, as do I, proving that I am not an anti-vaxxer. I just have questions about the COVID vaccine that I can’t really find too many people to answer. Tucker said, “Every year, a relatively small number of people seem to die after getting those shots. To be precise, in 2019, that number was 203 people. The year before, it was 119. In 2017, a total of 85 people died from the flu shot.” Out of 160 million people who get the flu shot, those numbers of people who died, every one of them being tragic to their loved ones, aren’t significant enough for the rest of us to consider not getting the flu shot. Carlson wanted to know how many people have died from getting the COVID vaccine: “We checked today. Here’s the answer, which comes from the same set of government numbers that we just listed: Between late December of 2020, and last month, a total of 3,362 people apparently died after getting the COVID vaccines in the United States. Three thousand, three hundred and sixty-two — that’s an average of 30 people every day. So, what does that add up to? By the way, that reporting period ended on April 23. We don’t have numbers past that, we’re not quite up to date. But we can assume that another 360 people have died in the 12 days since. That is a total of 3,722 deaths. Almost four thousand people died after getting the COVID vaccines. The actual number is almost certainly much higher than that — perhaps vastly higher.” [emphasis added] GET THE TRUTH: DailyTruthReport.com How come no one is talking about that? Do doctors and other medical personnel now instinctively know that you’re not supposed to talk about anything that violates the Woke Supremacy’s stance on COVID? This is our lives we’re talking about.  These are legitimate questions.  And these are serious concerns.  So why aren’t our “leaders” more willing to be transparent?  If they really want to earn the trust of the American people, perhaps they should begin with full transparency and integrity to the public.  Public health is at stake!"

114,114,true/false,"Bill Clinton Military Tribunal: Day 1 William Jefferson Clinton’s military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay began on Friday, following a three-day delay caused by a female panelist whose amorous display of affection toward the former president shocked the Office of Military Commissions.  The joviality and swagger Clinton displayed on Monday had evaporated when uniformed MPs escorted him to GITMO’s south courtroom Friday morning. A much more sullen and forlorn Bill Clinton, head hung low, was seated at the defense table beside the advocate he had chosen to represent him, the venerable David E. Kendall.  Kendall is an American attorney, a graduate of Wabash College, Yale Law School, and Worcester College, Oxford, who clerked with Supreme Court Justice Byron White, worked as associate counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and has been a partner at Williams & Connolly LLP of Washington, DC since 1981, where he has provided legal counsel to individuals and corporations on high-profile business and political matters. He represented Clinton during the 1998-1999 impeachment proceedings stemming from Clinton’s relations with White House intern Monica Lewinski.  At the start of Friday’s proceedings, Kendall boldly asked Rear Adm. John G. Hannink to “dismiss without prejudice” all charges leveled against Bill Clinton. Those charges include murder, sex crimes against minors, treason, theft of government property,  “President Clinton should not have to answer for the crimes of Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has already been sentenced and put to death. For many years, William Jefferson Clinton was largely oblivious to his wife’s transgressions, and once he became aware of them, he had only a peripheral involvement, at best. Make no mistake, she called all the shots. My client was along for the ride,” Kendall said.  “It was all Hillary,” Bill Clinton said.  But Vice Adm. Hannink was unimpressed at Clinton’s refusal to take accountability for his misdeeds. Paraphrasing author Peter Schweizer’s observation in the book Clinton Cash, Vice Adm. Hannink noted that “the couple that steals together, stays together,” and expounded on that theory by telling the tribunal that “apparently, the couple that kills together, stays together too.”  “And there is no statute of limitations on murder, not even for you, detainee Clinton,” Vice Adm. Hannink said.  “My client never killed anyone,” Kendall interjected.  His statement prompted Vice Adm. Hannink to play a taped telephone call for the tribunal. It was a 1993 conversation between Bill Clinton, then-Attorney General Janet Reno, then-ATF chief David Chipman, and former FBI director William Sessions. The call, recorded on day 50 of the Waco standoff between Branch Davidian leader David Koresh and U.S. alphabet agencies, underpinned Clinton’s mounting hatred of not only Koresh but also the women and children sheltered within the compound. Reno, Chipman, and Sessions urged Clinton to swiftly resolve the protracted stalemate, arguing that his indecisiveness would empower future “domestic terrorists” and religious zealots to follow in Koresh’s footsteps. Reno pleaded with Clinton to “burn them out,” and both Chipman and Sessions, after expressing mild trepidations, agreed the situation had become untenable. Clinton gave them “carte blanche,” and encouraged them to eliminate “malcontents” as long as blame was assigned to Koresh and the U.S. government was held harmless for any fatalities.  “I don’t care what happens to them, they didn’t vote for me anyway,” Clinton said on the call. “If they die, they die. Just make sure the finger can’t be pointed back at us, or more importantly, me. Let’s nip this in the bud right now.”  As most know, on day 51 the FBI and ATF launched a siege on the Branch Davidian Compound. A fire consumed the facility, and 76 Branch Davidians, including Koresh, 25 children, and two pregnant women, were reduced to ashes. Janet Reno later claimed that Koresh had burned out his own people, even though video footage of government vehicles and personnel equipped with flamethrowers and other incendiary devices surfaced in pictures and video.  On a recorded telephone call captured three days after the siege, Clinton congratulated Reno, saying the Branch Davidians “got what they deserved.”  In GITMO’s south courtroom, Vice Adm. Hannink replayed the recording several times.  “This was not Hillary; this was all you. You were president, not your wife. Nowhere is she heard on these calls. No one here is saying Koresh was a nice guy. But you, detainee Clinton, ordered those deaths,” Vice Adm. Hannink said.  Kendall objected, claiming the tapes had not been entered into discovery and, thus, he had been given no opportunity to rebut their validity.  “I understand you were an accomplished civilian litigator, Mr. Kendall, but this is a military commission, operating under full force and effect of the insurrection act,” Vice Adm. Hannink replied.  Kendall altered his tone and calmly requested a 72-hour continuance, until Monday morning, to allow him to authenticate the tapes.  “Very well, this commission will grant you your 72 hours, but we’ll tolerate no further delays after this,” Vice Adm. Hannink said.  He put the tribunal in recess until ten hundred hours Monday morning.  (Visited 149,474 times, 8 visits today)"

116,116,true/false,"Local NHS allocated £570 billion to fund the NHS Long Term Plan Local health services today are being allocated £570 billion to fund NHS services and implement the new long term plan.  Every area in England will receive a cash increase of at least 17% over the next five years, including a minimum rise of 4.4% next year.  Some £1 billion a year will be distributed according to the greatest need, with a redeveloped fairer funding formula channelling extra money to places with the highest rates of early death and unmet health needs.  Other changes will mean more investment from April targeted at areas with higher needs for community services for the first time and give greater regard to need for mental health services.  The allocation of funding for local Clinical Commissioning Groups follows publication of the NHS Long Term Plan setting out the priorities of the health service over the next decade.  NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said: “This funding backs delivery of the NHS long term plan in every part of England for the next five years.  “It will fund cutting edge treatments such as genome tests for every child with cancer, build up community services to provide more joined up care while taking pressure off hospitals and address the unmet need for mental health services.  “Tackling health inequalities in our society is not just about fairness but is a matter of hard-headed economics which will not only save lives but also save taxpayers’ money and NHS staff time.  “The public can be confident that the NHS will make every penny count, with data published by the Office for National Statistics yesterday showing productivity for health services in England grew by 3% in 2016/17, over three times the growth for the wider UK economy in that year.”  Under the new fairer funding formula two of the areas with the worst rates for premature deaths, Blackpool and Bradford City, will receive increases of 11% and 13% respectively next year alone meaning they have £40 million and £26 million more to invest.  The NHS Long Term Plan, unveiled on Monday, will save an estimated 85,000 more lives each year through earlier detection of killer conditions such as cancer and heart problems and a renewed focus on prevention.  The measures will help prevent 150,000 heart attacks, strokes and dementia cases while more than three million people will benefit from new and improved stroke, respiratory and cardiac services over the next decade.  There is also a new, historic guarantee that investment in primary, community and mental health care will grow faster than the growing overall NHS budget.  This will fund a £4.5 billion new service model for the 21st century across England, where health bodies come together to provide better, joined up care in partnership with local government.  The measures to tackle major physical conditions comes alongside the biggest ever investment in mental health services rising to at least £2.3 billion a year by 2023/24."
117,117,true/false,"Don't kick the kicker: Improving economy beats improving bond rating “There is infinite hope,” Kafka tells us, “only not for us.” This is a fittingly mystical epigram from a writer whose characters strive for ostensibly reachable goals and, tragically or amusingly, never manage to get any closer to them. But it seems to me, in our rapidly darkening world, that the converse of Kafka’s quip is equally true: There is no hope, except for us. I’m talking, of course, about climate change. The struggle to rein in global carbon emissions and keep the planet from melting down has the feel of Kafka’s fiction. The goal has been clear for thirty years, and despite earnest efforts we’ve made essentially no progress toward reaching it. Today, the scientific evidence verges on irrefutable. If you’re younger than sixty, you have a good chance of witnessing the radical destabilization of life on earth—massive crop failures, apocalyptic fires, imploding economies, epic flooding, hundreds of millions of refugees fleeing regions made uninhabitable by extreme heat or permanent drought. If you’re under thirty, you’re all but guaranteed to witness it. If you care about the planet, and about the people and animals who live on it, there are two ways to think about this. You can keep on hoping that catastrophe is preventable, and feel ever more frustrated or enraged by the world’s inaction. Or you can accept that disaster is coming, and begin to rethink what it means to have hope. Even at this late date, expressions of unrealistic hope continue to abound. Hardly a day seems to pass without my reading that it’s time to “roll up our sleeves” and “save the planet”; that the problem of climate change can be “solved” if we summon the collective will. Although this message was probably still true in 1988, when the science became fully clear, we’ve emitted as much atmospheric carbon in the past thirty years as we did in the previous two centuries of industrialization. The facts have changed, but somehow the message stays the same. Psychologically, this denial makes sense. Despite the outrageous fact that I’ll soon be dead forever, I live in the present, not the future. Given a choice between an alarming abstraction (death) and the reassuring evidence of my senses (breakfast!), my mind prefers to focus on the latter. The planet, too, is still marvelously intact, still basically normal—seasons changing, another election year coming, new comedies on Netflix—and its impending collapse is even harder to wrap my mind around than death. Other kinds of apocalypse, whether religious or thermonuclear or asteroidal, at least have the binary neatness of dying: one moment the world is there, the next moment it’s gone forever. Climate apocalypse, by contrast, is messy. It will take the form of increasingly severe crises compounding chaotically until civilization begins to fray. Things will get very bad, but maybe not too soon, and maybe not for everyone. Maybe not for me. Some of the denial, however, is more willful. The evil of the Republican Party’s position on climate science is well known, but denial is entrenched in progressive politics, too, or at least in its rhetoric. The Green New Deal, the blueprint for some of the most substantial proposals put forth on the issue, is still framed as our last chance to avert catastrophe and save the planet, by way of gargantuan renewable-energy projects. Many of the groups that support those proposals deploy the language of “stopping” climate change, or imply that there’s still time to prevent it. Unlike the political right, the left prides itself on listening to climate scientists, who do indeed allow that catastrophe is theoretically avertable. But not everyone seems to be listening carefully. The stress falls on the word theoretically. Our atmosphere and oceans can absorb only so much heat before climate change, intensified by various feedback loops, spins completely out of control. Some scientists and policymakers fear that we’re in danger of passing this point of no return if the global mean temperature rises by more than two degrees Celsius (maybe more, but also maybe less). The I.P.C.C.—the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change—tells us that, to limit the rise to less than two degrees, we not only need to reverse the trend of the past three decades. We need to approach zero net emissions, globally, in the next three decades. This is, to say the least, a tall order. It also assumes that you trust the I.P.C.C.’s calculations. New research, described last month in Scientific American, demonstrates that climate scientists, far from exaggerating the threat of climate change, have underestimated its pace and severity. To project the rise in the global mean temperature, scientists rely on complicated atmospheric modelling. They take a host of variables and run them through supercomputers to generate, say, ten thousand different simulations for the coming century, in order to make a “best” prediction of the rise in temperature. When a scientist predicts a rise of two degrees Celsius, she’s merely naming a number about which she’s very confident: the rise will be at least two degrees. The rise might, in fact, be far higher. As a non-scientist, I do my own kind of modelling. I run various future scenarios through my brain, apply the constraints of human psychology and political reality, take note of the relentless rise in global energy consumption (thus far, the carbon savings provided by renewable energy have been more than offset by consumer demand), and count the scenarios in which collective action averts catastrophe. The scenarios, which I draw from the prescriptions of policymakers and activists, share certain necessary conditions. The first condition is that every one of the world’s major polluting countries institute draconian conservation measures, shut down much of its energy and transportation infrastructure, and completely retool its economy. According to a recent paper in Nature, the carbon emissions from existing global infrastructure, if operated through its normal lifetime, will exceed our entire emissions “allowance”—the further gigatons of carbon that can be released without crossing the threshold of catastrophe. (This estimate does not include the thousands of new energy and transportation projects already planned or under construction.) To stay within that allowance, a top-down intervention needs to happen not only in every country but throughout every country. Making New York City a green utopia will not avail if Texans keep pumping oil and driving pickup trucks. The actions taken by these countries must also be the right ones. Vast sums of government money must be spent without wasting it and without lining the wrong pockets. Here it’s useful to recall the Kafkaesque joke of the European Union’s biofuel mandate, which served to accelerate the deforestation of Indonesia for palm-oil plantations, and the American subsidy of ethanol fuel, which turned out to benefit no one but corn farmers."

Aliyun, also known as Alibaba Cloud, “is the cloud computing unit of Alibaba Group,” according to TechCrunch.  Alibaba founder Jack Ma has not been seen for weeks.  An IP address owned by Kaspersky Lab – Moscow hacked into an IP address in Michigan on November 3, according to the data analysis. Kaspersky is a Russian software and cybersecurity firm. Kasperky Lab was co-founded by Eugene Kaspersky and his now-ex-wife, Natalya Kaspersky.  Eugene Kasperky, the CEO of Kaspersky Lab, served in the Soviet military intelligence service and is a graduate of The Technical Faculty of the KGB Higher School, now known as Institute of Cryptography, Telecommunications and Computer Science, part of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, widely known as the FSB.  Natalya Kaspersky is now the CEO of Russia’s InfoWatch Group and has a reported net worth of $270 million. “Natalya Kaspersky’s Snoop-Proof Phone Helps Putin Thwart Spies,” according to Bloomberg.  President Trump banned Kaspersky from all U.S. government networks when he signed the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act NDAA. “The ban, included as part of a broader defense policy spending bill that Trump signed, reinforces a directive issued by the Trump administration in September that civilian agencies remove Kaspersky Lab software within 90 days,” Reuters reported on December 12, 2017. “The law applies to both civilian and military networks.” U.S. District Court Judge for the U.S. District of the District of Columbia Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, former Presiding Judge of the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court FISA Court, upheld President Trump’s ban after Kaspersky Labs sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  “Christopher Krebs, a senior cyber security official at the Department of Homeland Security, told reporters that nearly all government agencies had fully removed Kaspersky products from their networks in compliance with the September order,” according to the Reuters report. President Trump “terminated” Krebs in mid-November 2020 after Krebs claimed the 2020 election was the most secure election in history.  An IP address owned by the University of Stuttgart, a research university in Germany, also hacked into an IP address in Michigan on November 3, according to the analysis.  Amazon Data Services in Toronto, Canada owns an IP address that hacked into a Michigan IP address on November 3, according to the analysis.  Dominion Voting Services is based in Toronto. Amazon Web Services AWS is a major provider of cloud services for U.S. elections.  IP addresses owned by Seznam, a search engine based in the Czech Republic, as well as an IP address owned by O2 Czech Republic, a Czech company offering mobile communications and internet access services, hacked into IP addresses in Michigan on November 3, the analysis shows.  China’s Shanghai UCloud Information Technology Company Limited owns an IP address that hacked into a Michigan IP address on November 3, according to the data analysis.  On November 4, 2020, Aliyun Computing Co. and ChinaNet, both based in China, hacked into IP addresses in Georgia, according to the data analysis.  https://www.blxware.org/  For ELECTION DATA Click on SCORECARD  COPYRIGHT 2021 MARY FANNING AND ALAN JONES"
119,119,true/false,"Biden Denied Entry to Pentagon The man who calls himself President of the United States, Joseph R. Biden, was denied entry to the Pentagon on Friday, Real Raw News has learned.  Shortly after meeting Democratic lawmakers to discuss more restrictive gun-control legislation, Biden went to Arlington, VA to advocate the merits of his planned withdrawal of all U.S. Armed Forces from Afghanistan. He had also sought to convince military leaders that Iran’s decision to enrich weapons-grade plutonium to 60% did not threaten U.S. interests, said an administration source speaking under condition of anonymity.  But Biden never made it inside.  Our source said U.S. Pentagon Police, part of the Pentagon Force Protection Agency, stopped Biden and his Secret Service detail in their tracks, informing them that they had standing orders to prevent Biden administration members–including Biden–from entering the building. Those orders reportedly included the use of deadly force.  “Biden demanded to know who gave the order, stumbling through his words, and was told the directive came directly from Gen. David H. Berger, Commandant of the United States Marine Corps and a ranking member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. When Biden demanded to speak with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, he was told Milley—a Biden supporter—was no longer in charge,” our source said.  Biden, our source added, became belligerent, saying as the President of the United States he had unrestricted access to all federal properties, including the Pentagon. He then instructed his three-man SS detail to “resolve the issue.”  Pentagon police drew sidearms, our source said.  “The Pentagon Protection Force told the SS agents they’d be making a mistake. That there were over a hundred inside ready to back them up if trouble started. The SS didn’t want any part of that and told Biden he’d have to force his way in himself, if he was so inclined,” our source said.  Moreover, Biden purportedly muttered an unbelievable phrase: “I bet that bastard is inside.”  We can only guess as to whom he was referring, but RRN guesses he meant none other Donald J. Trump. While it seems unlikely, we must remember that Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley opposed Trump’s presidency and was one of few high-ranking military leaders who supported Biden’s alleged 2020 victory. It is possible that Gen. Milley has been overthrown, and Marine Corps Gen. David Berger has assumed command of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  RRN will provide updates as they become available.

120,120,true/false,"Black Lives Matter Activists Following Conviction: ‘We’re Never Gonna Be Satisfied,’ ‘Burn It Down!’ Black Lives Matter activists fumed on Tuesday afternoon after a Minneapolis jury returned a verdict convicting former Minneapolis police Derek Chauvin on all counts, manslaughter and murder, in the death of George Floyd last May. The jury took less than a day to deliver the verdict, a move that surprised many who were expecting deliberations to take at least a few days. Chauvin now faces up to 75 years in prison when he is sentenced in several weeks. Following the verdict, journalist Drew Hernandez hit the streets of Minneapolis and recorded the reaction of far-left Black Lives Matter activists for the news. “Yes, we can defund the police,” one BLM supporter shouted. “And maybe one day we will abolish the police, but we ain’t gonna do s**t unless we have control over them. That is the number one thing right now. … We’re not gonna let these pigs in these buildings have any more control over our lives today. That s**t ends today.”Another BLM supporter called for people to attack “the system” from “every single f***ing angle” and to “go way beyond voting at this point.”
“We need to go way beyond voting at this point,” the BLM supporter said. “We need to be coming out here every single day if that’s what it takes, until we get justice for the people that they murdered a week ago that they’ve already forgotten about. … The only reason once again, that we got this conviction, is because we showed up. And if we don’t keep showing up, and if we don’t change laws, and we don’t attack this system, from every single f***ing angle we can, we will be here again.” Another BLM supporter said that they are “never gonna be satisfied” and suggested without evidence that what was happening, presumably in the U.S. justice system, constituted a “black genocide.”
“We’re not, we’re never gonna be satisfied,” the BLM supporter said. “Black Lives Matter isn’t a trend. It’s a movement. Black Lives Matter forever, okay? So, we’re not gonna stop just because we’ve got one conviction. We’re happy with the conviction, but we’re gonna keep going. … This is a black genocide. This is more than one case. We’re not satisfied.” Another BLM supporter said that it was “epic” that the Minneapolis Police Department precinct that Chauvin was based out of “burned to the ground.”
“Derrick Chauvin’s Police Department burned to the ground. So we have to remember, those people are still facing challenges for arson. We have to remember that we just set us up a map once again because that was epic!” Another BLM supporter, who self-identified as a “revolutionary,” repeatedly screamed and appeared to urge extreme action in altering the U.S. justice system."

122,122,true/false,"111 line increasing pressure on NHS, say leading doctors First Lady Melania Trump has been “looked down upon and disrespected by sneering liberals across the country” while “doing a brilliant job” according to Julia Roberts, who also declared that former First Lady Michelle Obama “isn’t fit to clean to clean her toilet.”Julia Roberts was speaking on the New York set of her new film, as principal photography began on the drama Ben Is Back. Michelle Obama paid a visit to the film production while in the vicinity and Julia Roberts agreed to meet her, however she opened up about the differences between America’s most recent First Ladies as soon as Michelle left the set. “Melania has her priorities straight and she is a great example for our young women,” Julia Roberts said. “Michelle? Talk about a wolf in sheepskin.“
The news comes days after Julia Roberts slammed Celine Dion for criticizing the POTUS and stating that she “hates America.“ “I can’t even look at an American flag anymore. I hate this country,” Canadian Celine Dion said, while complaining about the Trump presidency. “You’re wrong, Celine,” Julia Roberts fired back. “The America we know and love was destroyed by Obama and his disastrous presidency. If you disagree you can always go back to your own country. In fact, perhaps you really should.” Celine Dion was one of dozens of liberal celebrities who “threatened” to leave the United States and return to their homelands if America elected Donald Trump as president. So far, a grand total of zero of these liberal celebrities have followed through with their threat to leave. The sheer hypocrisy makes it hard to believe they really feel as strongly as they claim about Trump. It’s all hot air and virtue signaling from the celebrity contingent on the left."
123,123,true/false,"Chelsea Clinton Hanged at GITMO The false bravado Chelsea Clinton displayed at the conclusion of her military tribunal quickly evaporated when she learned the Office of Military Commissions intended to hang her, as it had her mother, for crimes committed against the nation and children of the world.  The decision to hang Clinton, a JAG source told Real Raw News, was not reached swiftly because Rear Adm. Crandall was initially uncertain whether legal precedence supported the execution of a criminal not convicted of murder or treason. Although the 3-officer panel recommended capitol punishment, Rear Adm. Crandall sought council instead of making a unilateral judgment.  On October 28, two days after Clinton’s conviction, Rear Adm. Crandall tasked 6 senior JAG officers with deciding whether Clinton should be hanged or spend life at Guantanamo Bay. Until that point, all executions took place after a military tribunal found the accused guilty of murder and/or treason, clearly defined capitol offenses worthy of a hanging or firing squad. Trafficking in foreign children, as opposed to American ones, “muddied the waters,” Rear Adm. Crandall said, but also admitted that the severity of Clinton’s crimes paralleled her mother’s.  For nine days JAG’s brightest legal minds pondered Clinton’s fate, ultimately concluding that Chelsea Clinton would indeed be hanged. “Chelsea Clinton’s crimes, on which she has been convicted, and wanton disregard for child safety and welfare leave us no choice but to support a death penalty. Her lack of remorse at her tribunal leads us to believe that lifelong imprisonment will not benefit her,” they wrote in a memorandum.  Upon learning her fate, Clinton collapsed in a tearful fit.  “You can’t hang me, I’m a mother, what about my children. They’ll be left motherless,” Clinton said to Rear Adm. Crandall.  “I guess you should have thought of that before you ruined the lives of thousands of mothers and children,” Rear Adm. Crandall snapped.  “Why don’t you hang Marc instead? Why aren’t you hanging him?” Clinton asked.  “He cooperated with us,” Rear Adm. Crandall replied.  “I’m so, so sorry. It was my mother and Bill. They forced me—” Clinton started, but Rear Adm. Crandall interrupted her.  “–You’re not very adroit at faking emotion. You hang tomorrow.”  And on the morning of November 6, Chelsea Clinton’s neck snapped, ending over 30 years of Clinton carnage.  RRN did not feel it necessary to spell out the details of the actual hanging as they were remarkably like those of other Deep State agents whose lives ended at the gallows.

124,124,true/false,"Obama’s Daughters Caught on Camera Burning US Flag at DC Protest – iolgue But things took a turn for the worse when riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowd, all to clear the way for President Donald Jebediah Trump to waddle across the street for a photo op in front of a church he doesn’t attend, wave around a copy of a holy book he doesn’t read, and ramble like a psychotic dictator of a country he doesn’t love.  Sasha and Malia had come to the protest equipped with military-grade gas masks, so they were not overcome by the tear gas that crippled so many of their fellow protestors. They stood still in front of the advancing police, trying to give others a chance to escape the rubber bullets and tear gas.  As the police shoved their way through the peaceful crowd, an enraged officer ripped an American flag out of the hands of a group of high school students who were standing silently, holding the flag, and refusing to give up their First Amendment right to peaceably assemble.  Just then, recognizing the Obama daughters, the cop wadded up the flag, lit a corner of it on fire, waved to a news camera from OAN, and threw the burning flag at Sasha and Malia.  The Obamas, horrified to see a flag being burned, stretched it out between them to try to keep more of it from catching fire. That’s when the camera caught the image of them, holding a burning American flag.  Presidential historian Sandy Batt, who has always hated made-up stories about the Obama girls, rolled her eyes and said,  “Oh for god’s sake, people will really think they burned a U.S. flag,” when she was reached for comment.  Don’t be one of those people."

An overwhelming percentage of the people will get $1,200 each, including our senior citizens and our tremendous military members and President Trump was proud to sign the bill, which will offer relief to millions.  Enter the socialist Democrats. Rarely pennywise and always pound-foolish, they have unilaterally decided that those who are on Social Security and members of the military already make enough money and that these payments will be preemptively taken from their upcoming pay.  Obviously this will have effect of making it difficult for those people to live until they get their government bailout. Seniors will be eating cat food. Soldiers will be eating each other. Do the Democrats care? Of course not.  Nancy Pelosi’s spokesman Joe Barron said:  “$1,200 is nothing. 4 days max of beer money for Speaker Pelosi. They should have prepared for this better. Seniors should be rationing their medications and throw away their cell phones. They’re worthless. A drain on society. I don’t feel bad for them at all. They think they are the greatest generation but most of them can’t even find their dentures. And don’t even get me started on the military. All they want to do wear a uniform and shoot guns. We let them do that. They shouldn’t be paid one cent.”  Donald Trump is a President for all of the people.

126,126,true/false,"Group behind Central Park's COVID-19 field hospital run by antigay evangelist “Global warming” is a myth — so say 80 graphs from 58 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in 2017. In other words, the so-called “Consensus” on global warming is a massive lie. And Donald Trump was quite right to quit the Paris agreement which pretended that the massive lie was true. By “global warming” these papers don’t, of course, mean the mild warming of around 0.8 degrees Celsius that the planet has experienced since the middle of the 19th century as the world crawled out of the Little Ice Age. Pretty much everyone, alarmists and skeptics alike, is agreed on that. Rather, they mean “global warming” in the sense that is most commonly used today by grant-troughing scientists, and huxter politicians, and scaremongering green activists, and brainwashed mainstream media (MSM) environmental correspondents. “Global warming” as in the scary, historically unprecedented, primarily man-made phenomenon which we must address urgently before the icecaps melt and the Pacific islands disappear beneath the waves and all the baby polar bears drown. What all these papers argue in their different ways is that the alarmist version of global warming — aka Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming (CAGW) — is a fake artefact. That is, all these different experts from around the world — China, Russia, Canada, the U.S., Italy, etc. — have been looking closely at different aspects of the global warming puzzle in various regions and on different timescales and come to the conclusion in irreproachable, peer-reviewed scientific ways that there is no evidence to support the global warming scare story. Late 20th century and early 21st century global warming, they show, is neither dramatic, nor unusual, nor scary. Here, as collated by Kenneth Richard at No Tricks Zone, are just some of the charts to prove it. Büntgen et al, below, shows that temperatures in the northern hemisphere were warmer in the early 1400s than they are today Abrantes et al (below) confirms the traditional view — which Michael Mann tried to dismiss with his discredited Hockey Stick chart — that the Medieval Warming Period was warmer than anything we have experienced in our own era. Here’s one from Li et al showing that China was much warmer 8,000 years ago Here’s an unusual one from Guillet et al suggesting that there’s nothing new about wildly early or late grape harvests through the centuries: And on and on it goes — there are 80 graphs in all, each showing in its different way why the scare about global warming has been horribly overdone because the evidence just doesn’t support its being unusual or a problem. Several of the papers note that the primary influence on warming appears to be solar activity. Few, if any, entertain the notion that carbon dioxide levels have much to do with it. The intellectually corrupt and mendacious alarmist science establishment — I’m thinking, for example, of my personal bete noir, the left-wing political activist and Nobel-prizewinning geneticist Sir Paul Nurse, former president of the Royal Society — would have us believe that climate skepticism is a minority activity, the preserve of a few cranks, championed only by people who don’t do the science. But this is just ugly propaganda. Here are dozens of reputable scientists from around the world with no axe to grind collaborating on studies which all corroborate, independently and rigorously, the increasingly respectable view that “man-made global warming” just isn’t a thing. Not that it ever was a thing, really. This debate — as I argue at some length in Watermelons — was always about left-wing ideology, quasi-religious hysteria, and “follow the money” corruption, never about “science.” Still, it’s always a comfort to know that “the science” is on our side too. They do so hate that fact, the Greenies."
127,127,true/false,"Fully Vaccinated account for 9 in every 10 Covid-19 Deaths since August according to latest Official Data Authorities are slowly tightening the noose again around the necks of the British public in response to an alleged new Covid-19 variant dubbed Omicron that is feared may evade the current available Covid-19 vaccines. The problem with this is official data shows the alleged Delta variant has been evading the Covid-19 vaccines for at least the 3 past months, because since August 2021 the fully vaccinated have accounted for 9 in every 10, Covid-19 deaths.  Public Health Scotland (PHS) publish a weekly report on Covid-19 statistics which includes data on cases, hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status.  The report includes data over a period of four weeks and the latest statistics were published by PHS on December 1st 2021, including data on cases and hospitalisations from 30th October to 26th November 2021, and data on deaths from 23rd October to 19th November 2021.  By analysing the data contained within the report alongside data from previous reports that stretches as far back as August 14th 2021, we can see that Scotland has very much been experiencing a ‘Pandemic of the Fully Vaccinated’ since at least August.  Proving the introduction of new restrictions has nothing to do with the worry that the new Omicron variant may impact the effectivenes of the Covid-19 vaccines, and instead has everything to do with control, because the jabs have proven to be ineffective for months.  Covid-19 Cases  Table 19 of the latest ‘Covid-19 Statistical Report’ shows the number of Covid-19 cases per week by vaccination status. We’ve created the following chart on the published data from several reports, including the most recent published December 1st.  As you can see from the above the unvaccinated population accounted for the majority of cases every week between August 21st and September 17th, but since then the fully vaccinated have accounted for the majority of cases every week. However, by including the number of cases among the partly vaccinated population we find that the vaccinated population have in fact accounted for the majority of Covid-19 cases since at least August 21st.  The above chart shows the cumulative number of cases per week by vaccination status between August 21st and November 26th. Here we can see that something significant happened in the week beginning 16th October in regard to the number of cases accumulating among the unvaccinated and fully vaccinated populations, in that the number of cases were beginning to fall among the unvaccinated whilst increasing significantly among the fully vaccinated.  Official data shows that between August 21st and November 26th there were 142,945 cases among the unvaccinated population, 30,204 cases among the partly vaccinated population, and 165,008 cases among the fully vaccinated, bringing the total number of cases among the vaccinated population in this time frame to 195,212.  Covid-19 Hospitalisations  Table 20 of the latest ‘Covid-19 Statistical Report’ shows the number of Covid-19 hospitalisations per week by vaccination status. We’ve created the following chart on the published data from several reports, including the most recent published December 1st.  As you can see from the above the data proves that it is the fully vaccinated population who have been putting a strain on the healthcare system and not the unvaccinated as the authorities and mainstream media would have you believe.  The above chart shows the cumulative number of hospitalisations per week by vaccination status between August 21st and November 26th, in which there were 2,531 hospitalisations among the unvaccinated population but more twice the among among the vaccinated population, who recorded 6,094 hospitalisations.  Covid-19 Deaths  Table 21 of the latest ‘Covid-19 Statistical Report’ shows the number of Covid-19 deaths per week by vaccination status. We’ve created the following chart on the published data from several reports, including the most recent published December 1st.  The data shows that the fully vaccinated have accounted for the vast majority of Covid-19 deaths by a long way since at least August 14th. In the past four weeks along there were just 59 deaths among the unvaccinated population whilst 407 deaths occurred among the vaccinated population.  This means the vaccinated population accounted for 9 in every 10 Covid-19 deaths between October 23rd and November 19th.  The above chart shows the cumulative number of deaths per week by vaccination status between August 14th and November 19th, in which there were just 219 deaths among the unvaccinated population, but 1,280 deaths among the vaccinated population.  This data suggests that the fully vaccinated are 144% more likely to die once hospitalisated with Covid-19 based on the hospitalisation/fatality rates that can be calculated from the statistics.  With 2,531 hospitalisations and 219 deaths among the unvaccinated population this equates to a hospitalisation/fatality rate of 8.6%.  But with 6,094 hospitalisations and 1,280 deaths among the vaccinated population this equates to a hospitalisation/fataity rate of 21%.  Pandemic of the Fully Vaccinated  The data available from Public Health Scotland stretching back 14 weeks proves very much that this is a pandemic of the fully vaccinated, and with the vaccinated accounting for 6 in every 10 cases (57%), 7 in every 10 hospitalisations (70%), and 9 in every 10 Covid-19 deaths (85%) since at least August, this also proves that the Covid-19 vaccines have already been ineffective for months.  Therefore any restrictions enforced in the name of protecting the public from the alleged new Omicron variant have absolutely nothing to do with protecting your health, and instead everything to do with control.

128,128,true/false,"Biden Says the Second Amendment is ‘Obsolete’ During the Republican National convention, President Trump spent a lot of time covering the dangers and ill-advised policies of a Biden administration. An America under the supervision of the radical Democrat candidate seems, at least to his watchful eye, a disaster in the making with our very lives and freedoms in serious jeopardy.  Just recently, Biden confirmed one of those very fears during a campaign speech at the Joe Barron Jewish community center in Pohtaytoe, Virginia, referring to the sacred and God-blessed second amendment right of all Americans to own and use firearms at any time anywhere for any reason whatsoever as “obsolete.” Clearly, this is either a case of Trump being right on the money, or a satirical article to drive gullible trumpers into blood pressure fits.  Supporters of the President constitute the country’s least educated and most violently gullible of citizens, and do, in fact, believe idiotic things about the amendment that are laughably untrue. Such as that it’s purpose is to fight the government should it become tyrannical. Sure, Jethro, they went through all the work of designing a country and government the likes of which the world had never seen, and then put in a self-destruct button in case you didn’t want to wear a mask, you pussy.  The truth is, there have only been two times the second amendment has been threatened in recent memory. The first was when Trump himself suggested “taking the guns and worrying about the legal stuff later.” The second was when Trump lied and said that Biden was coming after it. To no great shock, Trump’s parade of happy dipshits ignored the first and blew their own balls off about the second.  The history of gun-grabbing is long and storied, and always pushed as a fear tactic by republicans. Although the total number of guns confiscated by democrats remains at a steady “0”, it doesn’t stop the gullible from believing."
129,129,true/false,"A quote from Politifact: Gates never said that the first licensed COVID-19 vaccine would use experimental technology or permanently alter DNA; he said specifically that “we don’t know yet what the COVID-19 vaccine will look like.” The most recent research also shows that RNA vaccines, which are being tested for COVID-19 right now, do degrade naturally and don’t alter DNA permanently. It does appear that there is some contention over the potential that DNA vaccines may permanently change a person’s DNA, as highlighted in this white paper from biotech company Moderna, a leading developer of RNA vaccine technology: “DNA vaccine work began thirty years ago, but as yet there are no licensed DNA vaccines and most remain in Phase 1 testing. (Figure 5) The key challenge associated with DNA vaccines is that they must penetrate the cell nucleus (crossing two membranes; the cytoplasm and the nucleus). The DNA must then be transcribed in the nucleus into mRNA before moving to the cytoplasm to stimulate antigen production. This core complex pathway often requires both larger doses and special, often painful delivery devices using electric shocks or gold microspheres into person’s skin to deliver the DNA vaccine. Once inside the nucleus, DNA vaccines have a risk of permanently changing a person’s DNA. ” [Source] Given the current state of world affairs, we felt that providing this correction and explanation was the best way to bring clarity and another perspective to this important issue. For any comments or questions, please contact editor@wakingtimes.com. —- “Currently, there are no RNA vaccines approved for human use.” ~Wikipedia Rather than instruct people on how to improve their overall health or boost their immunity with healthy foods, quality supplements, and physical activity, the powers-that-be are telling the world that the only way to survive the Coronavirus crisis is to rush the development of a vaccine and then inject every human being on the planet. The U.S. government along with major cities like Chicago are already moving forward with plans to use government resources and the military to distribute hundreds of millions of doses of vaccines to Americans by the end of the year. At the forefront of this conversation is Bill Gates, who has emerged somehow as the world’s leading expert on pandemics and vaccines. Through his foundation he supports the WHO and the development of new vaccines, and is currently backing a number of pharmaceutical companies as they race to invent the product that will save the world from Covid-19. Typically, the process of developing, testing and mass producing vaccines takes years, but thanks to newly emerging, experimental technology, Gates hopes to be able to vaccine “7 billion healthy people” in record time. A new generation of vaccines is emerging as we speak. At present there are no DNA and RNA vaccines approved for human use, but as Gates says in the following post from his personal blog, the time for trying these out on everyone has come. In the following comment he explains the difference between traditional vaccines and DNA/RNA vaccines, which, again, have never been approved for human use: “Vaccines circumvent this whole process by teaching your body how to defeat a pathogen without ever getting sick. The two most common types—and the ones you’re probably most familiar with—are inactivated and live vaccines. Inactivated vaccines contain pathogens that have been killed. Live vaccines, on the other hand, are made of living pathogens that have been weakened (or “attenuated”). They’re highly effective but more prone to side effects than their inactivated counterparts. Inactivated and live vaccines are what we consider “traditional” approaches. There are a number of COVID-19 vaccine candidates of both types, and for good reason: they’re well-established. We know how to test and manufacture them. The downside is that they’re time-consuming to make. There’s a ton of material in each dose of a vaccine. Most of that material is biological, which means you have to grow it. That takes time, unfortunately. That’s why I’m particularly excited by two new approaches that some of the candidates are taking: RNA and DNA vaccines. If one of these new approaches pans out, we’ll likely be able to get vaccines out to the whole world much faster. (For the sake of simplicity, I’m only going to explain RNA vaccines. DNA vaccines are similar, just with a different type of genetic material and method of administration.) Our foundation—both through our own funding and through CEPI—has been supporting the development of an RNA vaccine platform for nearly a decade. We were planning to use it to make vaccines for diseases that affect the poor like malaria, but now it’s looking like one of the most promising options for COVID. The first candidate to start human trials was an RNA vaccine created by a company called Moderna. Here’s how an RNA vaccine works: rather than injecting a pathogen’s antigen into your body, you instead give the body the genetic code needed to produce that antigen itself. When the antigens appear on the outside of your cells, your immune system attacks them—and learns how to defeat future intruders in the process. You essentially turn your body into its own vaccine manufacturing unit. Here’s how an RNA vaccine works: rather than injecting a pathogen’s antigen into your body, you instead give the body the genetic code needed to produce that antigen itself. When the antigens appear on the outside of your cells, your immune system attacks them—and learns how to defeat future intruders in the process. You essentially turn your body into its own vaccine manufacturing unit. Because RNA vaccines let your body do most of the work, they don’t require much material. That makes them much faster to manufacture. There’s a catch, though: we don’t know for sure yet if RNA is a viable platform for vaccines. Since COVID would be the first RNA vaccine out of the gate, we have to prove both that the platform itself works and that it creates immunity. It’s a bit like building your computer system and your first piece of software at the same time.” ~ Bill Gates So, the rushed Covid-19 vaccine will most likely not be a traditional vaccine. It will not be tested for the typical duration that most vaccines are tested for. It will very likely be distributed by the military, and it everyone on the planet will have to take it.

130,130,true/false,"Biden Quietly Pardons 2,617 BLM Protesters Joe Biden has shown us all whose side he’ll be on when it comes to law and order.  In a sweeping secret pardon that includes more than 2,616 BLM “protesters,” Biden gave a big eff you to law enforcement.  Biden’s pardon includes “anyone arrested for protesting in a non-violent manner.” Basically, all they have to do is say “I dint do nuffin” and they’re free to go.  According to the White House, there is no pardon, and the issue of BLM protesters has yet to be addressed at all. According to Communications Director, Art Tubolls, the whole thing has been blown out of proportion:  “More like…made up. There is no pardon for anyone because Trump’s federal goons never actually arrested anyone. They just dropped them off in the morning in front of the closest Circle K with $2 for a large coffee and a blintz.”  Fact-checkers were quick to point out that Circle K doesn’t sell blintzes.  At any rate, the pardons may not be real to some people, but to those of us who believe Joe Biden is the next coming of the antichrist here to unseat Donald Trump and thrust America into the pits of hell, they’re as real as can be, and we won’t stand for it.  A source close to the President said the pardons may not exist, but that Biden was “very proud” to be able to sign them. Whether or not he signed them virtually or just in spirit remains to be seen. One thing is for sure: our streets are a little less safe today with Biden issuing — or not — pardons for nearly 3000 criminals.  It’s gonna be a long four years, America."
131,131,true/false,"Tom Hanks, 65, Passes Away, Confessed Admiration for Trump at the End Prolific acting legend, Tom Hanks, passed away suddenly this morning. The cause of his death has not been released.  Hanks enjoyed a long and successful career. He was well-liked by all those in the Hollywood community and his movies were always well received by the public, even the really crappy ones like “Castaway.” His body of work will live on for decades to come.  For the past several years, Hanks had been been very vocal with his opposition to President Trump. He often called the president names, none of which can be printed here, and when he did so, he made sure that his comments were broadcast far and wide for the public to hear. His deep hatred for President Trump has been very well known.  Of course, we all know why he said those things about Trump. Hanks was known to be a frequent visitor to Epstein Island and so he knew that the president was coming for him. His using all that energy on discrediting Trump’s every move was clearly an attempt to have him removed from office which would then allow him to stay free from prison.  While on his deathbed , however, Hanks must have realized that there was no point in carrying on the ruse any longer. According to his wife, Tom made a deathbed confession, the likes of which no one would have ever expected.  In it, he confessed his love for President Trump and all his accomplishments to date. He went so far as to say that the president was “really really great“ and that Trump “was the best possible choice for America. He’s done stellar work so far.”  His wife, Rita, was impressed by his honesty at the end but said that she wished he had told her all that years ago so that she could have “dumped his trumpy ass.”  The world has lost an iconic acting legend, but that’s not all. This revelation from Tom shows that we have also lost a future vote for Trump.  Share this:  .  ."
132,132,true/false,"Obama has Proposed 442 Tax Hikes Since Taking Office Anti-intellectual, anti-science, anti-education: In a disturbing development the Ohio House has passed legislation that would allow students to give wrong answers and not be penalized if those wrong answers are based on the student’s “sincerely held religious belief.” Cleveland.com reports: The Ohio House sent to the Senate on Wednesday a measure that would prohibit public schools from penalizing students for some work that contains religious beliefs. Critics have called the bill unnecessary or valuing religion over secularism… WKRC reports: The Ohio House on Wednesday passed the “Student Religious Liberties Act.” Under the law, students can’t be penalized if their work is scientifically wrong as long as the reasoning is because of their religious beliefs. Reporting on the new bill, Cleveland.com notes: If public school students turn in work saying the earth is only 10,000 years old, they cannot be penalized under Ohio House Bill 164 if its their religious beliefs. House Bill 164, known as the Ohio Student Religious Liberties Act of 2019, entails the following: Requires public schools to give students the same access to facilities if they want to meet for religious expression as they’d give secular groups. Removes a provision that allows school districts to limit religious expression to lunch periods or other non-instructional times. Allows students to engage in religious expression before, during and after school hours to the same extent as a student in secular activities or expression. Prohibits schools from restricting a student from engaging in religious expression in completion of homework, artwork and other assignments. In short, the proposed Ohio law would allow students to substitute religious dogma for science, and would not allow teachers to penalize students for giving wrong answers as long as those answers are based on the student’s religious beliefs. House Bill 164 passed by a vote of 61-3. Every Republican in the House supported the bill. It now moves to the Republican-controlled Senate. Bottom line: The Ohio House has passed legislation that would allow students to give wrong answers and not be penalized if those wrong answers are based on the student’s “sincerely held religious belief.”"
133,133,true/false,"BREAKING EXCLUSIVE: Ballots In Arizona’s Maricopa County Found Shredded and In Dumpster – Days Before Senate Audit To Begin Piles of shredded ballots were located today in a dumpster in Maricopa County Arizona. This find occurs only days before the Senate’s audit of the county’s 2020 election results is due to start.  For months the Board of Supervisors in Maricopa County have blocked and delayed any independent audit performed by the Arizona Senate of the County’s results in the 2020 Presidential election. As we’ve reported previously, after being subpoenaed by the Arizona Senate and then suing the Senate to prevent a Senate audit of their 2020 election results, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors (MCBOS) agreed to have an audit if they could pick the auditors. The two firms they picked they claimed were the only two who were certified by the governmental body the US Election Assistance Commission (EAC). However, we found that these firms were not certified at the time they were selected by the MCBOS:  The MCBOS went ahead and hired the firms they wanted to perform their audit but the audits were never structured to find any suspected fraud in the county. The validity of the 2 million ballots in the county was never even considered in the programs reportedly used by these audit firms:  TRENDING: BEAUTIFUL! Student Confronts Fake News Purveyor Brian Stelter from CNN at Disinfo Conference AND IT'S GLORIOUS! (VIDEO)  This is probably why these audits were set up the way they were (so no fraud would be identified). The auditors came to Phoenix and performed their work and some patriots found out that they could be observed on cameras in the facility where they were doing the work. These patriots watched and even sent a couple of individuals down to the center to check things out late one night. These individuals were greeted with a network that was labeled “f##k you”.  And as we reported, the audits were unprofessional in other areas as well:  This is when the Arizona Senate said enough and passed a bill that would grant the Arizona legislature the authority to subpoena election records like ballots and tabulating equipment and ignore any laws to the contrary.  The Senate is now in the process of selecting an auditor(s) to perform their audit. As the day for their audit approaches the heat must have gotten too hot for those guarding the ballots in Maricopa County.  Per our source on the ground in the County, yesterday an individual went by the Maricopa County Tabulation and election center and found doors wide open with seeming uninhibited access to the facility.  Today some other interested individuals in the county stopped by the same facility and found huge piles of ballots in the dumpster outside the facility.  Someone ordered the ballots be shredded.  We do not yet have the complete information on the shredded ballots.  This is not the first state where we found shredded ballots after the election. This also occurred in Georgia, another state where Biden won by a very slim margin.  What a mess. The corrupt FBI won’t investigate obvious crimes. The corrupt media won’t report them. The communist-leaning Democrats cover them up."
134,134,true/false,"Irrefutable: The coronavirus was engineered by scientists in a lab using well documented genetic engineering vectors that leave behind a “fingerprint” Natural News Every virology lab in the world that has run a genomic analysis of the coronavirus now knows that the coronavirus was engineered by human scientists. The proof is in the virus itself: The tools for genetic insertion are still present as remnants in the genetic code. Since these unique gene sequences don’t occur by random chance, they’re proof that this virus was engineered by scientists in a lab.  But the WHO and CDC are covering up this inconvenient fact in order to protect communist China and its biological weapons program, since no government wants the public to know the full truth about how frequently government-run labs experience outbreaks. Decades ago, for example, the U.S. Army ran an Ebola bioweapons lab in the United States, where a monkey infected one of the scientists there. The strain turned out to be infectious only in monkeys, not humans, so the world dodged a bullet, but the U.S. Army “nuked” the entire facility with chemical bombs, killing all the monkeys and wiping out any last remnant of the virus on U.S. soil.  You can read the full details of that incident in the book The Hot Zone by Richard Preston. We’ve also covered it at NaturalNews.com, where this book description is reprinted:  In 1989, Reston, VA — one of the most famous U.S. planned communities located about 10 miles from Washington DC — stood at the epicenter of a potential biological disaster. This well-known story was narrated by Richard Preston in a bone chilling account related to the recognition and containment of a devastating tropical filovirus at a monkey facility — the Reston Primate Quarantine Unit.  That outbreak occurred because Ebola was found to be spreading through the air ducts, confirming that Ebola can spread through the air. This simple fact was vigorously covered up by the entire medical establishment during the Ebola scare in the United States many years later, where the CDC transported an infected patient to a hospital in Dallas, subsequently infecting a nurse who was treated with highly toxic chemicals that caused permanent kidney damage she later sued the hospital for the damage she suffered.  The reason this is relevant is because in order to understand the coronavirus situation in China, we must first realize that virology research labs routinely experience lapses in containment. Even the United States has failed to contain deadly viral strains when trying to study them. China’s BSL-4 labs have experienced multiple accidental releases of SARS strains, and this new coronavirus is now confirmed to be an engineered strain that was either used in bioweapons research or vaccine experiments.  The genomic coding in the virus is not natural, in other words. Just as you would never encounter a snake in the desert that’s writing a book containing words and grammatical structure, the genetic sequences now identified in the coronavirus strain are, without question, proof that human engineers have been tinkering with the strain.  How to genetically engineer viruses: the pShuttle vector  One of the tools used to accomplish this genetic engineering is called pShuttle. It’s a genetic tool set that can carry a payload of genes to be inserted into the target virus.  Researchers engaged in genetic engineering can purchase the pShuttle sequence from online retailers such as AddGenes.org, which sells the sequence for $75, shipped in “bacteria as agar stab.”  The following map outlines the complete gene sequence of the pShuttle tool:  The method for using pShuttle is described in a PubMed document entitled, “A simplified system for generating recombinant adenoviruses.”  The summary of the paper describes, “a strategy that simplifies the generation and production of such viruses.” Here’s how the process works to achieve genetic engineering of viruses:  A recombinant adenoviral plasmid is generated with a minimum of enzymatic manipulations, using homologous recombination in bacteria rather than in eukaryotic cells. After transfections of such plasmids into a mammalian packaging cell line, viral production is conveniently followed with the aid of green fluorescent protein, encoded by a gene incorporated into the viral backbone. Homogeneous viruses can be obtained from this procedure without plaque purification.  The paper describes how this approach will, “expedite the process of generating and testing recombinant adenoviruses.”  During this process, of course, the pShuttle leaves behind unique code, a “fingerprint” of the genetic modification. It is this fingerprint that has now been identified in the coronavirus.  As revealed by genomics researcher James Lyons-Weiler in this bombshell analysis article, the pShuttle genetic code is found in the coronavirus that’s circulating in the wild.  This is proof that the virus has been engineered by human scientists.  “IPAK researchers found a sequence similarity between a pShuttle-SN recombination vector sequence and INS1378,” writes Lyons-Weiler for IPAK:  Another gene sequence also shows a 92% match with the Spike protein from the SARS coronavirus:  The process for achieving this was patented by Chinese researchers as shown in this patent link.  The pShuttle vector was used to insert SARS genes into the coronavirus, a process that makes it deadly to humans. “The very researchers conducting studies on SARS vaccines have cautioned repeatedly against human trials,” warns Lyons-Weiler:  The disease progression in of 2019-nCoV is consistent with those seen in animals and humans vaccinated against SARS and then challenged with re-infection. Thus, the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV is an experimental vaccine type must be seriously considered.  He also warns about, “studies that have reported serious immunopathology in animals – rats, ferrets, and monkeys – in which animals vaccinated against coronoviruses tended to have extremely high rates of respiratory failure upon subsequent exposure in the study when challenged with the wild-type coronavirus.”  He concludes:  If the Chinese government has been conducting human trials against SARS. MERS, or other coronviruses using recombined viruses, they may have made their citizens far more susceptible to acute respiratory distress syndrome upon infection with 2019-nCoV coronavirus.  Brighteon.com/a4d2afed-56c6-4602-b6ab-6f777ba4a69a  Another doctor from Beijing Medical University warns the virus appears to be genetically engineered  Lyons-Weiler is not alone in his assessment of the genetic engineering origins of the coronavirus. Dr. Yuhong Dong, who holds a doctorate degree in infectious diseases from Beijing University, writes in The Epoch Times:  Based on recently published scientific papers, this new coronavirus has unprecedented virologic features that suggest genetic engineering may have been involved in its creation. The virus presents with severe clinical features, thus it poses a huge threat to humans. It is imperative for scientists, physicians, and people all over the world, including governments and public health authorities, to make every effort to investigate this mysterious and suspicious virus in order to elucidate its origin and to protect the ultimate future of the human race.    Dr. Yuhong reminds us that a Jan. 30 science paper published in The Lancet concludes that, “recombination is probably not the reason for emergence of this virus.” In other words, this did not occur through natural mutations in the wild.  He also points to a Jan. 27th study by five Greek scientists who also concluded the coronavirus has no lineage to other viruses in the “family tree” that’s found in the wild. He writes:  A Jan. 27 2020, study by 5 Greek scientists analyzed the genetic relationships of 2019-nCoV and found that “the new coronavirus provides a new lineage for almost half of its genome, with no close genetic relationships to other viruses within the subgenus of sarbecovirus,” and has an unusual middle segment never seen before in any coronavirus. All this indicates that 2019-nCoV is a brand-new type of coronavirus. The study’s authors rejected the original hypothesis that 2019-nCoV originated from random natural mutations between different coronaviruses.  “No bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market”  Dr. Yuhong writes about The Lancet study by authors Roujian Lu et al., from the China Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, repeating a quote from that paper:  First, the outbreak was first reported in late December 2019, when most bat species in Wuhan are hibernating. Second, no bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market, whereas various non-aquatic animals including mammals were available for purchase. Third, the sequence identity between 2019-nCoV and its close relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 was less than 90%. Hence, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 are not direct ancestors of 2019-nCoV.  In other words, it isn’t from bats.  That means the entire mainstream media is lying to us about the real origins of the coronavirus.  That same paper goes on to underscore the misinformation in the official explanation, stating, “Many of the initially confirmed 2019-nCoV cases—27 of the first 41 in one report, 26 of 47 in another—were connected to the Wuhan market, but up to 45%, including the earliest handful, were not. This raises the possibility that the initial jump into people happened elsewhere.”  Both Lu in The Lancet paper linked above and Lyons-Weiler point to the presence of a SARS binding protein sequence in the coronavirus that allows it to easily infect human cells. As explained in The Epoch Times:  …despite considerable genetics distance between the Wuhan CoV and the human-infecting SARS-CoV, and the overall low homology of the Wuhan CoV S-protein to that of SARS-CoV, the Wuhan CoV S-protein had several patches of sequences in the receptor binding RBD domain with a high homology to that of SARS-CoV. The residues at positions 442, 472, 479, 487, and 491 in SARS-CoV S-protein were reported to be at receptor complex interface and considered critical for cross species and human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV. So to our surprise, despite replacing four out of five important interface amino acid residues, the Wuhan CoV S-protein was found to have a significant binding affinity to human ACE2. …The Wuhan CoV S-protein and SARS-CoV S-protein shared an almost identical 3-D structure in the RBD domain, thus maintaining similar van der Waals and electrostatic properties in the interaction interface. Thus the Wuhan CoV is still able to pose a significant public health risk for human transmission via the S protein–ACE2 binding pathway. emphasis added    As Dr. Yuhong asks, “How could this novel virus be so intelligent as to mutate precisely at selected sites while preserving its binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor? How did the virus change just four amino acids of the S-protein? Did the virus know how to use Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats CRISPR to make sure this would happen?”  It couldn’t happen by chance, in other words. The coronavirus is not a random mutation in the wild. It was engineered.  Many other scientists around the world are now investigating the gene sequences found in the coronavirus, and they are increasingly concluding that elements of the virus have been engineered.  Many of those scientists are being threatened and censored. One paper has so far been forced to be withdrawn and revised, no doubt to remove the key conclusions that point to the genetic engineering origins of the coronavirus, but the proof of its engineering cannot be denied forever.  Brighteon.com/0bddc3da-f590-445e-ac38-9a74e358a57c  Either the coronavirus was genetically engineered, or the science establishment is going to have to throw out the entire field of genomics research and claim it isn’t real  Eventually, the science establishment is either going to have to conclude that this coronavirus strain was engineered, or that all the laws of genetics science don’t work, and gene sequencing is imaginary sort of like transgenderism by the “progressive” Left, which has already abandoned biological reality.  So far they’ve tried to bamboozle the public into believing this is all some sort of accident from Mother Nature, but that has only worked because most of the public doesn’t understand enough science to counter the official propaganda. However, there are more than enough independent scientists around the world to prove that this pandemic strain was engineered by humans. More evidence is coming out each day.  Interestingly, as this article is going to press, all the official numbers of infections and deaths from coronavirus have been frozen for about 14 hours and counting, almost as if every nation of the world has agreed to stop reporting new numbers. This may be a temporary situation that gets resolved in the next few hours, but it’s highly suspicious. For the last week, we’ve been getting new updates about every 12 hours or sooner, and we’ve never seen the count frozen for this long.  At the same time, an 11th case of coronavirus has now been confirmed by the CDC in the United States, revealing that infections are continuing to spread in the USA, despite the efforts of the CDC to contain the outbreak.

135,135,true/false,"Turkey joins hands with Pakistan to spread unrest in India New Delhi, Feb 20 (IANS) After a Disinfo Lab report highlighted that the toolkit dropped accidentally by Greta Thunberg had a foreign expert – Pieter Friedrich – as resource point waging a propaganda war against India in collusion with Pakistan’s notorious spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), investigation by a Greek media outlet has revealed that Turkey is an “integral part” of this campaign, aiding Pakistan to spread unrest in India. The Disinfo Lab investigation titled ‘The Unending War: From Proxy War to Info-War’ released earlier this week has exposed the elaborate design which involved a slew of shady companies in the United States, fake foreign experts and even ghost entities to dent India’s peaceful, non-violent image. It mentioned in detail about the linkages of the mastermind waging an info-war/psy-war against India to major terror plot hatched against India in the 1990s in collusion with ISI and how, while taking the cover of Khalistan, the network “still around and connected” works for Pakistani interests. Following the leads from the Disinfo Lab report, an investigation done by a leading Greek news website has decoded the Ankara connection to the entire propaganda being peddled against India, especially during the ongoing farmers protest. “One of the most prominent names revealed in the report and has been promoting Pieter Friedrich’s propaganda as an ‘amplifier’, is Constantinople (Istanbul) based propagandist Ali Keskin. Sources suggest that he is the central figure responsible for coordination between the Pakistani ISI and the Turkish intelligence agency (MIT) on information warfare,” reported Greek City Times. The report said that Turkey has been an integral part of this warfare and has been aiding Pakistan in its disinformation campaign against India. Scanning Keskin’s Twitter handle, the Greek publication said that the war-mongering tweets made by him against India, Greece, France, UAE and Israel were mostly spread by Pakistani handles. “Several investigations by news organisations have revealed that disgruntled with the emerging India-UAE ties, Ali Keskin, with the help of his amplifiers in Pakistan, began a hashtag #BoycottUAE, which became a top trending hashtag within a couple of minutes. This was thanks to the magnification by radical Pakistanis,” the report said. Keskin, the investigation further revealed, has, along with another Turkish journalist Baba Umar “who is believed to be working for the ISI” been assigned to hit countries targeted by Turkey, especially India. The duo has been regularly coordinating with the Pakistani propagandists and promoting each-other’s content. Fredrich too has been producing online content with Umar, attacking India by taking a pro-Pakistani line on Kashmir. “What else does one need as a proof of Khalistani’s aligning with ISI sponsored proxies? The connection between Baba Umar and Pieter Friedrich suggests that Pakistan has started to act as a converging point to bring together all anti-India forces, and Turkey is the new entrant in this group,” an expert on Caucasian affairs told the Greek media outlet. The Disinfo Lab report had highlighted Islamabad’s K-2 (Kashmir-Khalistan) plan and the elaborate design and planning that is underway since 2007 driven by singular motive – to target India’s interest in four major ways: – Targeting idea of India – non-violence & Mahatma Gandhi – replacing it with an alternate image of ‘fascist India’ – Targeting India’s territorial integrity – working towards K-2 design – Targeting India’s interests abroad by working against Indian origin American politicians – Whitewashing Pakistan’s sins – clean chit to Pakistan (ISI) in Kabul Gurudwara Bombings & questioning Pulwama attack The report by Greek City Times also listed several other propagandists like California-based Zahra Billoo – a strong supporter of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Caliphate project – working as foot soldiers in the information war launched by Turkey-Pakistan. Billoo, the report said, has tried to malign US politician Tulsi Gabbard’s image in the past, and is currently busy “amplifying the anti-India messages on farmers’ protest in India”. Her tweets are liked by Friedrich, thus clearly establishing the anti-India nexus. It is however not for the first time that the Turkey-Pakistan connection to spread terror in India, especially Kashmir, has been exposed. Kurdish news agency ANF had reported a few months ago that Turkey has started preparing its gangs in Syria to send them to Kashmir to fight for Pakistan against India. It was reported that Ankara’s bid to extend its influence to Muslims in South Asia comes as part of Erdogan’s ongoing steps to challenge Saudi Arabia’s dominance of the Islamic world."
136,136,true/false,"Stangle: Impossible burgers are made of what? By Dr. James Stangle, DVM, Milesville, SD  ?The impossible whopper is being advertised by Burger King as a plant based alternative to the whopper. When food manufacturers started talking about making artificial meat, I, too, thought it would be impossible to make a hamburger cheaply enough to make it competitive. You see, I assumed that they would have to buy the individual amino acids the building blocks for protein and chemically string them together in the proper order, then remove the reagents chemicals needed to cause the chain reactions and then add something to give it the right textures.  ?The impossible whopper made by Impossible Foods bypassed all of those steps. Let’s compare the two. The impossible whopper patty is made from 24 ingredients. The most important ingredient is soy protein. The whopper patty has just one ingredient. That would be beef.  ?The impossible whopper has 630 calories, mostly from the added oils. The whopper has 660 calories. So, about 5% less calories, this is not a huge improvement.  The impossible whopper has 25 grams of protein. The whopper has 28 grams. Seems pretty equal, only 11% less protein in the impossible whopper. However, not all proteins are created equal. There are 20 amino acids. Nine of which are essential, meaning your body cannot make them so they are required in the diet. Each of those essential amino acids must meet a certain level to make a complete protein profile. If any essential amino acid does not hit the required amount, it is said to be rate limiting. As an analogy, picture nine chains connected in a line. All of the chains need to lift 100 pounds to carry the load. If one chain can only support 50 pounds, it doesn’t matter how much the others can support. The 50 pound chain is the rate limiting chain.  ?As an extreme example, bovine gelatin, aka Jell-O, is 100% protein; however, it completely lacks the essential amino acid histidine. Therefore, its value as a protein is zero. In beef the rate limiting amino acid is tryptophan, which is at 79% of the required level. In soy protein, the rate limiting amino acid is methionine, which is at 41% of the required level. So, to compare the impossible whopper with the whopper, you have to take 0.41 x 25 grams of protein and compare it to 0.79 x 28 grams of protein. The impossible whopper has 10 grams of usable protein and the whopper has 22 grams of usable protein. So you would have to eat two and a quarter impossible whoppers to get the same protein in one whopper.  ?Now, let’s compare the estrogen hormone in an impossible whopper to the whopper made from hormone implanted beef. The impossible whopper has 44 mg of estrogen and the whopper has 2.5 ng of estrogen. Now let me refresh your metric system. There are 1 million nanograms ng in one milligram mg. That means an impossible whopper has 18 million times as much estrogen as a regular whopper. Just six glasses of soy milk per day has enough estrogen to grow boobs on a male. That’s the equivalent of eating four impossible whoppers per day. You would have to eat 880 pounds of beef from an implanted steer to equal the amount of estrogen in one birth control pill.  There is one ingredient in the impossible whopper that bears mentioning. Beefs red color comes from hemoglobin, the oxygen binding protein in blood, and myoglobin, the molecule that takes the oxygen away from the hemoglobin. To get the same red color in an impossible whopper, they used leghemoglobin. This is the cool part. Leghemoglobin is made by the bacteria, Rhizobium. Rhizobium is the crucial bacterium that lives in the nodules of the roots of legumes like soybeans. Rhizobium has an enzyme that can take nitrogen from the air and turn it into fertilizer, which the plant can use. The bacterial enzyme that binds the nitrogen is damaged by the presence of oxygen so the bacterium makes the leghemoglobin to bind oxygen to keep it out of the way. To make enough leghemoglobin to add to the impossible whopper, scientists spliced the gene for leghemoglobin into yeast. They can grow the yeast easily and separate the leghemoglobin and add it to the impossible whopper. So the impossible whopper is technically a genetically modified organism GMO. Don’t get me wrong, I think it’s cool. I’m all in favor of GMO’s. More should be done with them to improve our food supply. Currently, the only GMO protein that is legal in the US is a GMO salmon that is engineered to grow twice as fast. Unfortunately, the production and sale of it in the US is blocked by Senator, Lisa Murkowsky R. Alaska. No doubt to protect Alaska’s salmon industry. Scientists have made a GMO milk cow which is modified to be polled hornless yet neither its meat nor milk is allowed to enter the food supply. What’s funny about the impossible whopper being a GMO is that the people most likely to eat it are the ones most likely to be against GMO’s.  ?So when you watch the next Burger King commercial and you see the guy dressed as a cowboy eating an impossible whopper saying, “Well, I’m a darn fool”. “Just say, yep!” There is another word for really big lie. It is called a whopper. Here’s to hoping that the impossible whopper is a possible flopper.  By Dr. James Stangle, DVM, Milesville, SD"

The head of Citizenship and Immigration Services tweaked the passage: ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free"". The official added the words ""who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge"". He later said the poem had referred to ""people coming from Europe"". Ken Cuccinelli, the Trump administration's acting head of Citizenship and Immigration Services, announced on Monday a new ""public charge"" requirement that limits legal migrants from seeking certain public benefits such as public housing or food aid, or are considered likely to do so in the future. image copyright Getty Images image caption The New Colossus was written by New York-born poet Emma Lazarus in 1883 The new regulation, known as a ""public charge rule"", was published in the Federal Register on Monday and will take effect on 15 October. The rule change is intended to reinforce ""ideals of self-sufficiency"", officials said. Critics argue that it will prevent low-income US residents from seeking help. What did the official say? On Tuesday, Mr Cuccinelli was asked by NPR whether the 1883 poem titled The New Colossus at the Statue of Liberty still applied. ""Would you also agree that Emma Lazarus's words etched on the Statue of Liberty, 'Give me your tired, give me your poor,' are also a part of the American ethos?"" asked NPR's Rachel Martin. image copyright Getty Images image caption Ken Cuccinelli, the acting head of US Citizenship and Immigration Services ""They certainly are,"" Mr Cuccinelli responded. ""Give me your tired and your poor - who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge."" ""That plaque was put on the Statue of Liberty at almost the same time as the first public charge [law] was passed - very interesting timing,"" he added. The actual passage reads in part: ""Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"" In the interview, he added that immigrants are welcome ""who can stand on their own two feet, be self-sufficient, pull themselves up by their bootstraps, again, as in the American tradition"". After the host asked if the policy ""appears to change the definition of the American dream,"" he said: ""We invite people to come here and join us as a privilege. ""No one has a right to become an American who isn't born here as an American."" media caption Top immigration official says public charge rule will not target ""any particular group"" Mr Cuccinelli was pressed later on CNN about his comments, and pushed back on claims he was trying to re-write the poem. He insisted he was answering a question and accused people on the left of ""twisting"" his comments. Then asked by anchor Erin Burnett about what America stands for, he said: ""Of course that poem was referring back to people coming from Europe - where they had class-based societies where people were considering wretched if they weren't in the right class."" The two then discussed their own immigrant ancestry, with Ms Burnett pointing out his rule would have ""excluded"" her family. ""I'm here because they were allowed in, and I'm an anchor on CNN,"" she said. Beto O'Rouke, a Democratic presidential hopeful from Texas, shared a clip from the interview and said the comments show his Trump administration ""think the Statue of Liberty only applies to white people"".

View original tweet on Twitter Who will be affected by the new rule? Immigrants who are already permanent residents in the US are unlikely to be affected by the rule change. It also does not apply to refugees and asylum applicants. But applicants for visa extensions, green cards or US citizenship will be subject to the change. Those who do not meet income standards or who are deemed likely to rely on benefits such as Medicaid (government-run healthcare) or housing vouchers in future may be blocked from entering the country. Those already in the US could also have their applications rejected. An estimated 22 million legal residents in the US are without citizenship, and many of these are likely to be affected. President Trump has made immigration a central theme of his administration. This latest move is part of his government's efforts to curb legal immigration. What has reaction been? The Democratic led House Homeland Security Committee condemned Mr Cuccinelli's revision in a tweet, calling the words ""vile and un-American"". ""It's clear the Trump Administration just wants to keep certain people out,"" the committee wrote, calling Mr Cuccinelli ""a xenophobic, anti-immigrant fringe figure who has no business being in government"". Others pointed to his background as the attorney general of Virginia, in which he led a conservative campaign against immigration and homosexuality. Asked about Mr Cuccinelli's remarks on Tuesday, President Trump did not directly respond to the Statue of Liberty quote, but said: ""I don't think it's fair to have the American taxpayer pay for people to come into the United States."" ""I'm tired of seeing our taxpayer paying for people to come into the country and immediately go onto welfare and various other things."
138,138,true/false,"Marc Mezvinsky, Chelsea’s Husband, to Face Military Tribunal It was thought that Marc Mezvinsky, husband to the late Chelsea Clinton, had struck an immunity from prosecution deal with the Office of Military Commissions and the Judge Advocate General’s Corps, but Rear Adm. Darse E. Crandall announced on Tuesday that Mezvinsky, whose testimony helped convict Clinton, will indeed be prosecuted as a co-conspirator to Chelsea’s crimes.  A JAG source speaking under promise of anonymity told RRN that Rear Adm. Crandall revoked Mezvinsky’s immunity plea after learning that he had marginalized his role in Hillary and Chelsea’s child trafficking ring. At Clinton’s tribunal Mezvinsky had painted himself a victim, claiming the Clintons had made him an indentured servant in exchange for allowing Chelsea to be his bride. Mezvinsky testified under oath that the scope of his crime was destroying records linking the Clintons to the sale of underage boys and girls. He had told the Office of Military Commissions that his undying, amorous affection for Chelsea led him down a deep, dark path of self-regrets.  Although JAG and the OMC had not previously disclosed Mezvinsky’s fate, RRN heard through sources that Mezvinsky would be released from custody for having testified against Chelsea, presumably to care for his own children—odd since he helped destroy the lives of so many others.  On Tuesday, November 16, Rear Adm. Crandall said new evidence will clearly illustrate that Mezvinsky did far more than burn and shred and digitally cleanse evidence of the Clintons’ crimes. RRN has not been made aware of what that evidence might be, but it must be damning because Rear Adm. Crandall will ask the tribunal to consider capital punishment.  “The investigation into Clinton crimes didn’t end with Hillary’s death, not with Chelsea’s either. It’s been ongoing. There’s been an ongoing effort to identify kids whom the Clintons victimized—establishing their identities and getting testimony from ones that escaped fates worse than death. All I can say right now is Mezvinsky minimalized his involvement; the rest will come out at trial,” our source said.  Mezvinsky, he added, has been “detained” at Guantanamo Bay ever since his apprehension. Unlike other GITMO “guests,” Mezvinsky has avoided Camp Delta and instead been housed in barracks modernized to appear like a contemporary apartment.  “That will now change, now that he’s indicted and not a witness. On Monday he’ll be moved to Delta to await his tribunal, which will begin after Thanksgiving weekend. He’s been a wreck since Chelsea got hanged,” our source said.  Mezvinsky has reportedly lamented his wife’s death, sobbing indefatigably over his lost love.  “Seems like he really loved her, still does. It’s tragic misplaced love pushed him to a criminal life, and how he must pay the price,” our source said.  (Visited 102,379 times, 6 visits today)"
139,139,true/false,"Alabama Supreme Court Recognizes Unborn as Persons in Landmark Ruling MONTGOMERY, Ala., Jan. 12, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- The Alabama Supreme Court has ruled that a chemical endangerment statute must protect children who have not been born yet. The strongly worded ruling is the most important affirmation of the personhood of the pre-born child since the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.  The case was appealed to the AL Supreme Court by Amanda Kimbrough, a mother who admits that she smoked meth three days before her baby was born at 25 weeks. Tragically, baby Timmy lived for only a few minutes. The autopsy showed that the baby died from methamphetamine exposure.  The Alabama Supreme Court has dealt a massive blow to the constitutional fraud of Roe v. Wade by recognizing that the preborn child is a person, explained Personhood USA Legal Analyst Gualberto Garcia Jones, J.D. This is yet another confirmation that the fight for personhood is targeting the Achilles' heel of the abortion industry and Roe v. Wade.  Kimbrough's attorney had previously debated Personhood Alabama founding member Attorney Ben DuPre on CNN. Kimbrough's attorney claimed in the interview that their case hinged upon the fact that the law regarding methamphetamine exposure to children did not apply to unborn children, only to born children.  The New York Times covered Kimbrough's case in in April, when she was found guilty of a Class A felony. The article quoted assistant district attorney Angela Hulsey as stating, She caused the death of another person, a person that will never have the chance to go to school, go to the prom, get married, have children of their own. You're dealing with the most innocent of victims.  The Alabama Supreme Court agreed with Hulsey, stating in their ruling that, The decision of this Court today is in keeping with the widespread legal recognition that unborn children are persons with rights that should be protected by law.  The Alabama Supreme Court ruling is a monumental victory for the personhood rights of preborn children, affirmed Personhood Alabama member Dan Becker. Personhood Alabama is committed to continuing our fight for the rights of every baby in Alabama.  Personhood Alabama is a chapter of Personhood USA, an organization established to seek protection for the personhood rights of every human being, born and unborn..

140,140,true/false,"Fauci knew about HCQ in 2005 -- nobody needed to die Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose “expert” advice to President Trump has resulted in the complete shutdown of the greatest economic engine in world history, has known since 2005 that chloroquine is an effective inhibitor of coronaviruses.  How did he know this? Because of research done by the National Institutes of Health, of which he is the director. In connection with the SARS outbreak - caused by a coronavirus dubbed SARS- CoV - the NIH researched chloroquine and concluded that it was effective at stopping the SARS coronavirus in its tracks. The COVID-19 bug is likewise a coronavirus, labeled SARS-CoV-2. While not exactly the same virus as SARS-CoV-1, it is genetically related to it, and shares 79% of its genome, as the name SARS-CoV-2 implies. They both use the same host cell receptor, which is what viruses use to gain entry to the cell and infect the victim.  The Virology Journal - the official publication of Dr. Fauci’s National Institutes of Health - published what is now a blockbuster article on August 22, 2005, under the heading - get ready for this - “Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread.” Emphasis mine throughout. Write the researchers, “We report...that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage.”  This means, of course, that Dr. Fauci pictured at right has known for 15 years that chloroquine and it’s even milder derivative hydroxychloroquine HCQ will not only treat a current case of coronavirus “therapeutic” but prevent future cases “prophylactic”. So HCQ functions as both a cure and a vaccine. In other words, it’s a wonder drug for coronavirus. Said Dr. Fauci’s NIH in 2005, “concentrations of 10 ?M completely abolished SARS-CoV infection.” Fauci’s researchers add, “chloroquine can effectively reduce the establishment of infection and spread of SARS-CoV.”  Dr. Didier Raoult, the Anthony Fauci of France, had such spectacular success using HCQ to treat victims of SARS-CoV-2 that he said way back on February 25 that “it’s game over” for coronavirus.  He and a team of researchers reported that the use of HCQ administered with both azithromycin and zinc cured 79 of 80 patients with only “rare and minor” adverse events. “In conclusion,” these researchers write, “we confirm the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine associated with azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 and its potential effectiveness in the early impairment of contagiousness.”  The highly-publicized VA study that purported to show HCQ was ineffective showed nothing of the sort. HCQ wasn’t administered until the patients were virtually on their deathbeds when research indicates it should be prescribed as soon as symptoms are apparent. Plus, HCQ was administered without azithromycin and zinc, which form the cocktail that makes it supremely effective. At-risk individuals need to receive the HCQ cocktail at the first sign of symptoms.  But Governor Andrew Cuomo banned the use of HCQ in the entire state of New York on March 6, the Democrat governors of Nevada and Michigan soon followed suit, and by March 28 the whole country was under incarceration-in-place fatwas.  Nothing happened with regard to the use of HCQ in the U.S. until March 20, when President Trump put his foot down and insisted that the FDA consider authorizing HCQ for off-label use to treat SARS-CoV-2.  On March 23, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko reported that he had treated around 500 coronavirus patients with HCQ and had seen an astonishing 100% success rate. That’s not the “anecdotal” evidence Dr. Fauci sneers at, but actual results with real patients in clinical settings.  “Since last Thursday, my team has treated approximately 350 patients in Kiryas Joel and another 150 patients in other areas of New York with the above regimen. Of this group and the information provided to me by affiliated medical teams, we have had ZERO deaths, ZERO hospitalizations, and ZERO intubations. In addition, I have not heard of any negative side effects other than approximately 10% of patients with temporary nausea and diarrhea.”  Said Dr. Zelenko:  If you scale this nationally, the economy will rebound much quicker. The country will open again. And let me tell you a very important point. This treatment costs about $20. That’s very important because you can scale that nationally. If every treatment costs $20,000, that’s not so good.  All I’m doing is repurposing old, available drugs which we know their safety profiles, and using them in a unique combination in an outpatient setting.  The questions are disturbing to a spectacular degree. If Dr. Fauci has known since 2005 of the effectiveness of HCQ, why hasn’t it been administered immediately after people show symptoms, as Dr. Zelenko has done? Maybe then nobody would have died and nobody would have been incarcerated in place except the sick, which is who a quarantine is for in the first place. To paraphrase Jesus, it’s not the symptom-free who need HCQ but the sick. And they need it at the first sign of symptoms.  While the regressive health care establishment wants the HCQ cocktail to only be administered late in the course of the infection, from a medical standpoint, this is stupid. Said one doctor, “As a physician, this baffles me. I can’t think of a single infectious condition — bacterial, fungal, or viral — where the best medical treatment is to delay the use of an anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, or anti-viral until the infection is far advanced.”  So why has Dr. Fauci minimized and dismissed HCQ at every turn instead of pushing this thing from jump street? He didn’t even launch clinical trials of HCQ until April 9, by which time 33,000 people had died.  This may be why: “Chloroquine, a relatively safe, effective and cheap drug used for treating many human diseases...is effective in inhibiting the infection and spread of SARS CoV.” That’s the problem. It is safe, inexpensive, and it works - in other words, there’s nothing sexy or avant-garde about HCQ. It’s been around since 1934.  Given human nature, it’s possible, even likely, that those who are chasing the unicorn of a coronavirus vaccine are doing so for reasons other than human health. I can’t see into anybody’s heart, and can’t presume to know their motives, but on the other hand, human nature recognizes that there’s no glory in pushing HCQ, and nobody is going to get anything named for him in the history books. The polio vaccine was developed by Jonas Salk in 1954, and it is still known as the “Salk vaccine.” There will be no “Fauci vaccine” if HCQ is the answer to the problem.  So while Dr. Fauci is tut-tutting and pooh-poohing HCQ, Dr. Raoult and Dr. Zelensky are out there saving lives at $20 a pop. Maybe we should spend more time listening to them than the wizards-of-smart bureaucrats the Talking Snake Media fawns over.  Dr. Fauci is regarded by the Talking Snake Media as the Oracle at Delphi. The entire nation hangs on his every word. But if nobody is dying and nobody is locked down, his 15 minutes of fame fades to zero. Very few people are not going to be influenced by that prospect, especially when it’s easy to keep the attention of the public by continuing to feed the panic.  It should not be overlooked that there is no money in HCQ for Big Pharma since HCQ is a generic that can be manufactured so cheaply there is little profit margin in it. On the other hand, the payday for a vaccine will literally be off-the-charts. Who knows what kind of behind-the-scenes pressure is being put on Fauci and others in the health care establishment?  There is a monstrous reputational risk for those who will be found to have dismissively waved off a treatment that could have been used from the very beginning, even back on February 15 when Dr. Fauci said that the risk from Coronavirus was “minuscule.” How many lives could have been saved if the heads of our multi-billion dollar health care bureaucracy had been advocating for HCQ treatment from day one? We’ll never know. Instead, their advice has been dangerous and deadly in every sense of that word.  Someday - maybe even today - we will be able to identify the individuals who had the knowledge and expertise to make a global difference, but turned up their noses at the solution when it could have made all the difference in the world."
141,141,true/false,"Wages back above pre-economic crisis levels SHARE Madison - Gov. Scott Walker's proposal to increase funding for voucher and public charter schools as well as his plan to create a new stream of funding to allow special-needs children to attend private schools drew immediate criticism Sunday from the state's largest teacher union, public school advocates and a major disability rights group. According to funding proposals unveiled by the governor's office Sunday, Walker is making money available that could be used as incentive payments for teachers and schools based on how well schools perform on state report cards. Walker will propose a modest increase - roughly 1% - in funding for Wisconsin public schools in his budget to the Legislature on Wednesday, two years after his steep cuts and all but elimination of collective bargaining for teachers sparked the unsuccessful movement to recall Walker from office. Tom Beebe, project director for Opportunity to Learn Wisconsin, a liberal-leaning group and former executive director of the Wisconsin Alliance for Excellent Schools, has been critical of Walker's cuts to education. He said the amount of general aid increase proposed for this next biennial budget - $129.2 million over two years - only amounts to about $161 for each of Wisconsin's 800,000 public-school students. ""If the revenue cap does not go up, then there is no new money going to schools no matter how much aid increases,"" Beebe said. ""The increase in school funding simply goes to property-tax payers, not into the classroom."" Mary Bell, president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the state's largest teacher union, said the modest increase was really just keeping overall revenue for schools flat. ""The stagnant revenue on top of the largest cuts to education funding in Wisconsin history in the last budget is another clear indication that this governor has no intention of supporting neighborhood schools,"" Bell said in a statement. ""(Walker's) real focus is privatizing public education with another infusion of resources to the unaccountable taxpayer-funded private school voucher program while leaving our neighborhood public schools on life support,"" she added. The Republican-controlled Legislature will review Walker's budget over the next four months and make changes before voting on it sometime in June. The two-year spending plan takes effect in July. State Rep. Sondy Pope, ranking Democrat on the Assembly's Education Committee, said Walker's proposal isn't enough. At the rate of state aid funding for public schools, it would take 12 years to replace the money lost in the last budget, she said. Walker contends schools have been able to save money because the collective bargaining law also required teachers to contribute more toward their pension and health care benefits. The nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance reported in November that those cuts in benefits and limiting union-negotiated raises to the rate of inflation offset about two-thirds of the reductions in school revenue in the 2011-'12 academic year. Pope said the increase in aid Walker is proposing won't be enough to help schools struggling to make ends meet. ""These people are trying to starve Wisconsin public schools,"" she said. Republican Sen. Luther Olsen, chairman of the Senate's Education Committee, said he was glad to see Walker putting more money into public education. ""It's a lot better than having to cut like we did in the last budget,"" he said. ""It's not as much as I wanted, but we're glad it's not negative or zero."" Walker's funding for schools includes $73 million more for voucher schools, $23 million for charter schools, and $21 million in grants for special-needs students to receive a voucher to attend private schools. A proposal for those special-needs vouchers passed the Assembly last session, despite broad opposition from the state Department of Public Instruction, disabilities rights groups, and the state school boards association. It did not pass the Senate. Lisa Pugh, public policy coordinator for Disability Rights Wisconsin, expressed concern that special-needs vouchers were now being proposed as part of the budget, because it would be a significant policy change in the way students with special needs are served. And that should be debated in education legislative committees, she said. Also, the $21 million for special-needs children could have been applied to help public schools across the state, not just for the minority of children who could use that taxpayer subsidy to attend a private school, she said. Walker's plans for expanding the more well-known voucher system encompassing Milwaukee's long-standing program and Racine's new program are highly anticipated, but he did not immediately provide those details. Funding for the UW System would go up $181 million under the budget, two years after it was cut by $315 million. Technical college aid would increase $5 million. UW spokesman David Giroux said the increased funding, coupled with the university being exempted from so-called lapses that could have resulted in $66 million in cuts, was ""very positive."" ""We want to create a stronger workforce for Wisconsin, and new taxpayer investments are essential to that effort,"" Giroux said. ""It looks like we will have enough funding to preserve today's levels of college access and quality, along with new investments in UW programs focused on job creation. That's a smart investment."" Walker is making $64 million available in incentive payments for K-12 schools, tied to their grades on statewide report cards. Of that, $24 million would go to schools with an A or B grade, $30 million would go to schools that show a certain level of improvement on the report cards and $10 million would be available to the lowest-performing districts for a one-time grant if they provide an acceptable improvement plan. Brian Pleva, lobbyist for the American Federation for Children Wisconsin, a conservative group, praised Walker's increase for voucher- and charter-school funding because it would give low-income and middle-class parents more educational choices. He also said that special-needs scholarships would help a minority of families for which local public schools aren't meeting their children's needs. Walker said in a statement Sunday that the budget proposals will reward successes and provide incentives to schools to drive achievement and accountability. In this next biennial budget, total K-12 funding would go up $276 million, according to the AP. But Walker will not lift the lid on revenue limits, saying he was concerned about moves that might cause property taxes to increase. The proposed increase in aid to schools comes after Walker cut general school aid by $834 million two years ago, a more than 8% drop from the previous funding period. To restrict school boards from raising property taxes to replace the drop in school aid, the governor proposed reducing districts' revenue limit authority - the combined amount they're able to raise in local property taxes and state general school aid - by 5.5%. As a result, the average school per-pupil revenue limit dropped about $555 in 2011-'12, from $10,100 in 2010-'11. About this story Scott Bauer, reporting for The Associated Press in Madison, and Erin Richards of the Journal Sentinel staff, reporting in Milwaukee, compiled this report."
142,142,true/false,"Clinton Military Tribunal Set for April 8 Hillary Clinton will have her day in court; more precisely, on April 8 she will face a military tribunal to answer for crimes committed against America and its people.  As reported previously, U.S. Navy SEALs under Trump’s command staged a March 2 raid on Clinton’s Chappaqua, NY, estate, capturing her and seizing laptops that link the former First Lady to countless atrocities. She has been held under military guard at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center Camp Delta since March 5.  In just over a week, the villainous, vile creature will stand before a military tribunal consisting of six U.S. military officers handpicked by Donald J. Trump and his advisory board. A Trump source familiar with the proceedings told RRN that the officers who will serve as both judge and jury cover a broad range of military ranks—from O-3 (captain) to 0-9 (Lt. General)—selected from all branches of U.S. Armed Forces.  “The choice was not done hastily. Trump’s team spent weeks picking the officers. Trump wanted to remove himself from the equation and ensure that the officers picked were not tainted by any bias for Clinton. No matter what, the odds are stacked against her. A tribunal isn’t an ordinary trial, and Clinton is no longer an American citizen,” our source said.  Stripped of her citizenship, Clinton is no longer afforded the protections of the U.S. Constitution and Geneva Convention. She is a detainee, or enemy combatant, which means she has no rights, not even the right to remain silent. In a military tribunal, silence is equated with guilt.  “Clinton was asked if she wanted an advocate to speak on her behalf, but the loon said she would defend herself. She decried the whole idea of a military tribunal as lunacy and has been babbling out how her people are going to free her. It doesn’t look good for her. She’s being charged with treason, sedition, assassinations, assassination attempts—the list goes on,” our source said.  Moreover, Trump has held Clinton responsible for the deaths of four Americans in the Benghazi Massacre: Ambassador Chris Stephens, Information Officer Sean Smith, and CIA contractors Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods, both former U.S. Navy SEALs. Clinton’s inaction led to their deaths; therefore, Trump decreed she must be held to account.  Our source said Clinton faces one of three possible outcomes: acquittal, life at GITMO, or a firing squad.  (Visited 66,477 times, 8 visits today)"

145,145,true/false,"Horowitz: The very concerning data from Scotland “The vaccines are incredibly safe. They protect us against Omicron; they protect us against Delta; they protect us against COVID."" Those were the words of fully vaccinated CDC Director Rochelle Walensky while testifying before the Senate Health Committee with two masks on her face on Jan. 11.  Scottish data shows that the COVID-19 age-standardized case rate is highest among the two-dose vaccinated and lowest among unvaccinated! It further shows this trend of negative efficacy for the double-vaccinated persisting for hospitalizations and deaths. Something is very wrong here, and together with other data points, it raises concerning questions about the negative effect of waning antibodies, constant boosting, and the consequences of a leaky vaccine with narrow-spectrum suboptimal antibodies against an ever-evolving virus.  Every Wednesday, Public Health Scotland (PHS) has been publishing a weekly report on COVID data juxtaposed to vaccination rates. Table 14 of this week’s “Public Health Scotland COVID-19 & Winter Statistical Report” lays bare in plain English (and math) a rate of negative efficacy for the vaccine:  As you can see, while the overall Omicron wave seems to be receding in Scotland, age-standardized case rates per 100,000 people were the lowest in the unvaccinated cohort every week for the past four weeks. Thus, it’s not just the fact that the unvaccinated accounted for only 11.5% of cases the past two weeks, but even adjusted for age-stratified vaccination rates (PHS already does the math for you) the unvaccinated had the lowest infection rate out of the four cohorts – especially during the peak of Omicron. Furthermore, we see that even the triple-vaccinated clearly have no efficacy against infection, although they have some degree less negative efficacy than the double-vaccinated.  Here is a linear presentation of the depth of the Omicron wave by vaccination status, where you can see that the unvaccinated had the shallowest wave:  This also coincides with the latest data from the U.K. Health Security Agency of the entire United Kingdom. This data now shows higher rates of infection among the triple-vaccinated in all but the youngest people.  Full stop right here. Any public policy measure – from vaccine passports to discrimination – cannot be justified under the science, even if one’s conscience is OK with apartheid. In fact, clearly this shows that, especially with Omicron, the vaccinated are the super-spreaders. Before we get to hospitalizations and deaths, the notion that the unvaccinated are somehow responsible for the continued spread of this virus is completely contradicted by the data. Some might suggest without evidence that the unvaccinated possibly have a higher rate of prior infection; however, Omicron seems to attack even those who already had previous versions of SARS-CoV-2.  Now onto hospitalizations and deaths. While the vaccines clearly provided some degree of protection for some people for several months against severe illness (while possibly causing even more spread), the Scottish data paints a concerning picture of the long-term consequences of the mass vaccination. People like Dr. Geert Vanden Bossche have been warning that if you mass-vaccinate with a leaky, narrow-spectrum (only recognizes spike protein) vaccine in middle of a raging pandemic, the virus would get more virulent over time.  This concern manifests itself at two time periods when the antibodies are “sub-optimal.” There is a period of a few weeks after the jab when the antibodies are strong enough to bind but not strong enough to neutralize, and then at the back end (estimated at four to six months for the original shot, but likely much shorter for the booster), a period when they wane. The media and public health tyrants like to focus your attention on a snapshot of time, but ignore the totality of circumstances that the shots are creating negative efficacy before and after, while using accounting gimmicks to mask the problem.  Remember how the lockdowns were hailed as a success for a number of countries that initially did well, while Sweden now has the lowest rate of excess mortality in Europe in 2021?  Just as with lockdowns, the mass vaccination needs to be judged after all nine innings of the ballgame.  With that said, let’s take a look at tables 15 and 16 – the acute COVID hospitalization and death rates, respectively:  What is clearly evident both from the hospitalizations and deaths is that the double-vaccinated are now worse off per capita even against critical illness, and that pattern appears to be accelerating. Again, this evidently shows a pattern of negative efficacy even against critical illness over time as the shots wear off, increasingly quickly with Omicron. Why is there no desire to study the source of this negative efficacy and whether the fact that the vaccine is non-sterilizing, wanes quickly with sub-optimal antibodies, is narrow-spectrum, and is increasingly out of synch with the changing virus is going to make the pandemic worse in the long run?  Some will look at the chart and conclude that the boosters are amazing. But first it’s important to recognize that even the boosters don’t stop transmission at all even in the short run, and then, based on the latest hospitalization data, appear to wane just like the original shots. Relatedly, you will notice a pattern: the unvaccinated and two-dose cohorts always appear worse and the one-shot and three-shot cohorts always appear better. This is where the most important part of the data set comes into play.  You see, all cases during the first 21 days after the first shot are counted in the “unvaccinated” cohort, while the first 14 days after one receives the 3rd shot is counted among the two-dose cohort. See the definitions from Appendix 6 of the report.  We know from numerous studies (see here and here) that people are actually the most vulnerable to COVID during the first few weeks on the upswing of the antibodies, when T cells are likely suppressed. This is why the health departments smartly count them in the unvaccinated pile. Hence, for all these months, all the cases and deaths from those made more vulnerable from the first shot – which is caused by the mass vaccination, not the unvaccinated – are counted against the unvaccinated. Over time, as the shots waned on the back end, the truth became evident. Now they are starting the cycle all over again by making the two-dose group look even worse than they are by dumping all of the cases caused by the initial take-up from the third dose into the cohort of double-vaccinated.  It’s the ultimate pandemic Ponzi scheme. Just wait another two months and see what the fourth-shot group looks like relative to the triple-dosers, as the immediate vaccination causes an even greater spike in cases. In other words, you have to look in totality where we are headed rather than manipulating a snapshot of time.  What this report shows is that just 18.5% of the hospitalizations in Scotland were unvaccinated, but even that number includes numerous people within 21 days of the first shot, which is clearly a very vulnerable time. It’s akin to telling someone in a foxhole to run across the field of fire to get to a bunker that might be safer, but he runs an even higher risk of getting cut down before reaching the bunker. Then, after a few hours, the bunker will get overrun by the enemy and you have to run through a new field of fire to get to the next bunker.  Likewise, when a therapeutic lowers symptom severity through immune suppression, it’s a flash in the pan. Eventually, that mechanism of action will come back to bite you in the proverbial arm. And this is even before we get to the long-term concern that multiple shots will create permanent immune suppression by creating original antigenic sin, a position now articulated by the European Medicines Agency and top Israeli immunologists.    Just how prominent is the infection rate within the first 14-21 days of getting the shot, thereby completely distorting the epidemiological data and ultimate perception of efficacy of the shots? Although we don’t have data from the U.K. or U.S. on the timing of infection relative to vaccination period, Alberta, Canada evidently publishes some of that data. According to U.K. researcher Joel Smalley, who screenshotted the chart from the Alberta government’s website before it was taken down, roughly 40% of cases, 47.6% of hospitalizations, and 56% of deaths among the vaccinated occurred within 14 days of vaccination ! Here is the graphical presentation that was on the website, according to Smalley. The top chart represents cases, the middle is hospitalizations, and the bottom is deaths:  Alberta, like many governments, counts the first 14 days as unvaccinated. In Scotland, they are counting the first 21 days after the first dose as unvaccinated and 14 days following subsequent doses in the cohort of the previous numbered dose. Obviously, we can’t mix the Alberta time-based data with the overall Scottish data, but common sense dictates that a bunch of cases from the immune suppression period of the initial vaccination are being blamed on the unvaccinated, and the perception of the booster shots is also likely being ameliorated at the expense of the double-jabbed cohort. For example, in Alberta, it appears that roughly 60% of the hospitalizations in the vaxxed cohort got COVID within 21 days of the shot, which in Scotland, would all be counted as unvaccinated cases. Thus, they deliberately chose the cutoff date for designation of vax status after the inflection point where they see the most COVID cases post-vax!  This deep dive into the data from Scotland should serve as a Rosetta stone for the macro observations we have seen from day one. We are seeing the most vaccinated nations and states being hammered with more cases than ever in a way that defies anything we should expect to see from a safe and effective vaccine. Here are just a few of the many examples:  Dr. Fauci recently told Bloomberg news that “there are some inherent ‘non-believers’ that no matter what you say, they give you a real problem.” He’s right. It takes a true religious level of adherence – like a believer – to continue supporting his narrative, despite the plain facts before our every eyes."
146,146,true/false,"Military Arrests Former President George W. Bush U.S. Special Forces arrested former President George W. Bush Saturday morning at his Crawford, Texas, ranch following a blistering firefight with Secret Service agents and private security contractors assigned to protect him.  On Friday evening, a Special Forces “Alpha Detachment” stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, received from U.S. Army Special Operations Command orders to infiltrate the ranch and arrest the 43rd president. SF were told to expect resistance because recent intelligence on the ranch showed that Bush had surrounded himself with armed private security contractors in addition to the trio of Secret Service agents that routinely patrolled the grounds.  Transportation to the ranch was provided by the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, nicknamed Night Stalkers, a group of highly skilled chopper pilots that conduct transport, attack, assault, and reconnaissance missions, at night, at low altitude, and on short notice. The choppers had to make 3 refueling stops to reach their destination.  Under cover of darkness early Saturday morning, the choppers descended into a clearing near the southeast corner of Bush’s 1,600-acre ranch, far from the staff trailers and the main house where they hoped to find Bush sleeping. After offloading SF, the choppers ascended into the night to await a call for exfiltration.  A military source familiar with the mission told Real Raw News that Special Operations Command had obtained detailed satellite imagery of the property as well as locations of trail cams that live-streamed to a communications bunker 100 yards from the main building.  “Intelligence estimated that Bush had 20 security contractors and 3 Secret Service on the property. The plan was to exploit blind spots in the surveillance cameras, ingress to the main building, subdue Bush’s personal guards, and drag him to the exfil point without alerting the larger security force. But something went horribly wrong,” our source said.  Special Forces had approached to within 200 yards of the main house when all hell broke loose.  Two open-top ATVs, each with a driver and 3 security personnel, sped out of the darkness and toward the encroaching SF unit, the headlights momentarily illuminating the soldiers as they separated into groups and dove for cover. Bush’s security unleashed a hailstorm of suppressive fire, wounding one soldier and killing another. While one SF group engaged the enemy, the other dashed toward the main house, hoping to capture Bush before he could be evacuated on his own private helicopter, which sat parked near the main structure.  “The battle turned in our favor quickly. SF took cover behind a rock wall and with the aid of NVGs shot out the tires on both vehicles and then killed or grievously wounded Bush’s security. But they knew there was still at least a dozen patrolling the property and they would’ve been alerted and on their way. Time was of the essence,” our source said.  The second SF unit reached the main house just as 2 Secret Service agents emerged and began steering Bush, still in his pajamas, to an armored limousine parked alongside dense shrubbery. SF instructed them to halt and throw up their hands, but the agents wheeled around and drew weapons, only to be killed a second later.  Somewhere on the property a deafening klaxon blared like an air raid siren.  “They gagged and bagged Bush, then regrouped. They couldn’t make the exfil point, not with one KIA and a teammate with a sucking chest wound. They radioed for pickup where they stood. A pilot told them that enemy forces were mobilizing near the staff trailers, and they had only minutes to get out of there. The birds weren’t armed for combat; otherwise, they could’ve hosed down those trailers,” our source said.  The choppers touched down only long enough to retrieve SF and their package, avoiding further conflict.  Our source said that JAG and the Office of Military Commissions had long sought Bush’s arrest. He did not say why it waited so long or why it felt such an impetus to grab Bush Saturday morning. Bush, he said, has been charged with treason and is being held to account for the deaths of thousands of soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan and for his role in masterminding 9/11, in addition to other crimes.  “He will face a military tribunal,” our source said.

147,147,true/false,"Georgia to Review Mail-in Ballot Signatures to Boost Confidence in Elections 0 DECATUR, Alabama – Police were recently tipped off to a reported meth lab that was being run by Walmart employees in what they are calling one of the biggest busts in decades. Police Chief Robert Garner said that an anonymous tip was left on their drug hotline, expressing concern about a horrible burning smell that was coming from the back of the Decatur WalMart facility. When an officer was sent to investigate, the store was instantly shut down as he discovered a meth lab that took up the entire back room. “The thing was massive, and contained enough materials to make hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds of crystal meth,” said Chief Garner. “Apparently, every employee in the store was a part of it, from working with and gathering materials, to cooking, to selling it outside of the store. It was a full, massive operation.” No one from Walmart’s corporate office was available for comment, but an unofficial spokesperson did say that they were “disappointed” that they weren’t able to use their company discount to get meth before the place was shut down. 0 Comments comments"
148,148,true/false,"Climate Shock: 90 Percent Of The World’s Glaciers Are GROWING A new NASA study, released on Friday, admits that ice is accumulating in Antarctica. Satellite measurements show an 82-112 gigaton-a-year net ice gain. That’s 82-112 billion tons per year! Nine zeroes! in other words that is 112,000,000,000 tons. Per year. It’s hard to comprehend how much ice that really is, so let’s put it in perspective. Let’s assume that they’re talking short tons (2,000 lbs). That’s about the weight of an old VW Beetle. Those old Beetles measured 14 feet long.  Multiply 112 billion by 14 feet and you get 1,560 billion feet. Divide that by the distance from the earth to the moon (239,000 miles),  and you’d have a string of VW Beetles stretching all the way to the moon. Not once, not twice, but 45 times.  All the way to the moon. That’s a helluva lot of new ice. Every single year. And we’re worried about global warming? Not only is the Antarctic Ice Sheet growing, NASA admits that the growth is actually reducing sea-level rise. This also confirms what I’ve been saying all along. Antarctica contains 90 percent of the earth’s ice. If the Antarctic Ice Sheet is growing, wouldn’t that mean that more than 90 percent of the world’s glaciers are growing? Here are excerpts, taken from NASA’s own website: “NASA – Antarctic Ice Sheet Is Growing” A new NASA study says that an increase in Antarctic snow accumulation that began 10,000 years ago is currently adding enough ice to the continent to outweigh the increased losses from its thinning glaciers. The research challenges the conclusions of other studies, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) 2013 report, which says that Antarctica is overall losing land ice. According to the new analysis of satellite data, the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net gain of 112 billion tons of ice a year from 1992 to 2001. That net gain slowed to 82 billion tons of ice per year between 2003 and 2008. “We’re essentially in agreement with other studies that show an increase in ice discharge in the Antarctic Peninsula and the Thwaites and Pine Island region of West Antarctica,” said Jay Zwally, a glaciologist with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and lead author of the study, which was published on Oct. 30 in the Journal of Glaciology. “Our main disagreement is for East Antarctica and the interior of West Antarctica – there, we see an ice gain that exceeds the losses in the other areas.”  Zwally added that his team “measured small height changes over large areas, as well as the large changes observed over smaller areas.” Scientists calculate how much the ice sheet is growing or shrinking from the changes in surface height that are measured by the satellite altimeters. In locations where the amount of new snowfall accumulating on an ice sheet is not equal to the ice flow downward and outward to the ocean, the surface height changes and the ice-sheet mass grows or shrinks. The study analyzed changes in the surface height of the Antarctic ice sheet measured by radar altimeters on two European Space Agency European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellites, spanning from 1992 to 2001, and by the laser altimeter on NASA’s Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) from 2003 to 2008. They also used information on snow accumulation for tens of thousands of years, derived by other scientists from ice cores, to conclude that East Antarctica has been thickening for a very long time. The extra snowfall that began 10,000 years ago has been slowly accumulating on the ice sheet and compacting into solid ice over millennia, thickening the ice in East Antarctica and the interior of West Antarctica by an average of 0.7 inches (1.7 centimeters) per year. “The good news is that Antarctica is not currently contributing to sea level rise, but is taking 0.23 millimeters per year away,” Zwally said."
149,149,true/false,"COVID-19 No Vaccine Needed, There Is Already A Cure Dr. Richard Bartlett, a Dallas MD who previously advised Governor Rick Perry for 7 years has a lifesaving COVID breakthrough, that Taiwan, Japan, Singapore and Iceland are also using. The breakthrough is an inexpensive generic drug used to help asthmatics for more than 20 years, but the US and most of the world’s governments are using the WHO’s blind acceptance of the failed China strategy.  The deaths in every state, and every country could almost stop overnight if health professionals changed course immediately. For some reason, the NIH and CDC want to act as slow as molasses, but a small number of doctors are already doing this with their patients and they are seeing immediate success.  Will it work for every single patient? That remains to be seen, but many people who have used this protocol saw immediate results. This is the same path taken by Taiwan 24 million people, 7 deaths, Japan 126 million, 977 deaths, Singapore 5.6 million, 26 deaths Iceland 341,000 population, 10 deaths.  The Doctor and His Successes  Dr. Richard Bartlett has been practicing in Texas for 28 years. Gov. Perry asked him to be on the Health Disparities Task Force for two years, and he stayed for seven years. He is a regular CBS-TV health expert. He is also a medical author, who undertakes medical missions around the world.  Dr Bartlett says he is giving his COVID-19 patients an inhaled steroid, a standard asthma treatment. Not only is this treatment working, he says many of his patients see immediate results. For best effect, this generic medicine is administered through a nebulizer machine, not an inhaler.  100% of Dr. Bartlett’s patients are alive, and he has been using it since March, almost four months.  The Virus and The Medicine  COVID is a respiratory inflammatory disease so an effective medicine must address respiratory inflammation.  The medicine used by Dr. Bartlett is administered as part of a trio. First, there is an inhaled asthma medication, a steroid that costs $200 for the complete treatment. It is administered through a nebulizer, and it takes about 5 minutes. In addition, Dr. Bartlett gives an antibiotic to protect from secondary infection of pneumonia, and also zinc, which fights against virus multiplication.  Here is how Dr. Bartlett explains it. “You plug in the machine, put the pre-mixed, pre-measured medicine from the pharmacy into the [machine] reservoir and push the ‘on’ button. You breathe it for 5 minutes.”  “Patients tell me they feel better during the first treatment. Their chest pain goes away. Their shortness of breath goes away. Then their fever breaks.”  This very safe medicine has been used on millions of people, including premature babies and also fragile people in nursing homes, for more than 20 years. It has no cardiac risk.  Why This Works  Dr. Bertlett says “COVID is a respiratory virus that goes into the lungs, and binds with ACE receptors in the lungs. That triggers a cytokine storm inflammatory chemicals and enzymes all over the body.”  COVID kills some people if they are not treated. 50% of people get COVID but they don’t even know. For the 20% at risk, there are treatments that are already valid and working. Unfortunately, there are also failed protocols that are being used and repeated, killing people who did not need to die, had the right approach been taken, as Dr. Bartlett’s work shows.  “There is a lot of research on this medicine already and it is very safe,” Dr. Bartlett says.  The Patients  One of Dr. Bartlett’s patients has 2 types of lymphoma and is on chemotherapy. After being in bed at home with a fever for 5 days, she called him and he started her on the treatment that night. By the morning, her fever broke. She recovered over the weekend and worked a full day on Monday, and has since had two negative COVID tests.  Another of his patients has a 50-year history of smoking, and had quadruple bypass surgery. Even with high blood pressure and thyroid disease, this patient also had a positive result.  Why Repeat The Failed China Strategy?  The failed China strategy is being followed because the World Health Organization is promoting it. Some countries have already realized the failure and changed to the same winning strategy used by Dr. Bartlett.  Although the treatment used by Dr. Bartlett, Singapore, Japan, and Taiwan works, and it is very low cost, the CDC and NIH allow very expensive experimental pharmaceuticals to be used by doctors.  The strategy Dr. Bartlett talks about is “Early Testing. Early Treatment.” This is the same strategy the U.S. uses for cancer, heart disease, stroke and other infections.  That is not the strategy promoted by WHO, which has praised the failed China strategy. Italy followed their strategy and more than 30,000 people died there.  The failed Chinese strategy is “wait until the house is burned 2/3 down and then seek help.” The USA, Australia , the UK and most other countries are currently using the failed China strategy of lockdown and late intervention. The US, at least has massively ramped up its testing regime.  Health Authority Advice  The advice of many health authorities is “Don’t seek help if you have mild-to-moderate symptoms. Wait until you have severe symptoms,” Dr Bartlett says.  Bartlett says some people go to the ER because they feel bad, but they are sent home with a positive test, and are told “Take Tylenol and tough it out at home.”  “That’s a terrible plan for any healthcare problem, especially one that can kill you,” Bartlett says.  Waiting For A Useless Vaccine  Dr. Fauci, the NIH, the CDC and governments around the world are pinning their hopes on a vaccine. That is a strategy doomed to failure because, just like influenza, viruses mutate all the time, and every year, the flu vaccine is changed. This is the reason entities like the Gates Foundation and Big Pharma love vaccines so much. They can make massive amounts of money, because it never ends – it is recurring income.  COVID-19 is just like the ‘flu that kills more than a million people every year. It is an inflammatory respiratory disease and there are already proven safe protocols to keep that kind of medical problem under control.  The fact that the course of action proposed by Dr. Bartlett costs $200 and some of the untested antivirals cost $30,000 plus a hospital stay says a lot about why some people push for a vaccine. People have been conditioned to believe an annual vaccine is the answer to every problem.  Dr. Bartlett’s Paper  In an effort to attract attention to this breakthrough information, Dr. Bartlett has written a paper that cites 51 other articles. The problem is that papers take months to be peer-reviewed and published. In the meantime, people continue to die. Doctors could use this safe protocol now, without waiting, if they knew about it. That’s the reason for this story – one more possibility of getting the information into the hands of people who can make a difference.  Dr. Bartlett isn’t sitting idle, either. He is doing his best to get this information out, but governments work very slowly. They always have and likely always will. While governments around the world dither, people die. Politicians are often protected from information like this, thanks to their staff, who decide what they see. We’re trying to get past those gatekeepers, and would appreciate your help.  This protocol may not work in every case, but the halting of new deaths in Taiwan, Japan, and Singapore shows that it is thousands of times better than what is happening in the U.S. and most other countries today. The key is early action.  To hear the complete interview with Dr. Richard Bartlett by Debbie Georgatos on “America Can We Talk,” watch the video below.

Governor and Secretary of State in Georgia Took Money From China To Steal Election from Trump  UPDATED 8:23 PM EST See Bottom -- Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp and the Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger both allegedly took money from Communist China, perhaps to intentionally THROW or STEAL the November 3 Election in that state, to Joe Biden.  According to very high level sources from my years working National Security Intelligence with the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force, the feds have PROOF of the payments to both Kemp and Raffensperger.  The Trump election legal team forced the President to WAIT before revealing this, until both Kemp and Raffensperger CERTIFIED the Election results.  According to those same sources, once Kemp and Raffensperger CERTIFIED the results, their crime was complete. Both men certified those election results this week. By law, Mr. Raffensperger was obliged to certify the election results before 5 p.m. on Friday. Gov. Kemp, had to then certify the results by 5 p.m. on Saturday. Both men did exactly those acts.  The implications of this revelation are staggering. First, that a sitting REPUBLICAN Governor would stab his Party's President, and our nation, in the back, for a foreign government, is utterly horrifying. People are already asking  My God, what could they have offered that he would sell out his own people? His own country?  That a foreign nation would DARE to pay money in order to rig or steal a U.S. Presidential Election is . . . a casus belli Cause for war. China appears to have tried to STEAL our freedom by STEALING our Elections. War is justified.  Again, the national security intelligence sources with whom I have spoken, assure me this information is solid and the proof is already in government hands.  MORE . . .  Georgia Governor Brian P.

151,151,other,"Flu Vaccine Increases Coronavirus Risk 36% Says Military Study A recent military study shows military personnel evaluated who received the flu vaccine were at 36 percent increased risk for coronavirus with varied benefit in preventing some strains of the flu.  “Examining noninfluenza viruses specifically, the odds of both coronavirus and human metapneumovirus in vaccinated individuals were significantly higher when compared to unvaccinated individuals OR = 1.36 and 1.51, respectively Table 5.”  The flu vaccine studied demonstrated varied benefit in flu prevention – – some strains showed significant benefit while others did not.  Titled, Influenza vaccination and respiratory virus interference among Department of Defense personnel during the 2017–2018 influenza season, the report on the study addresses the phenomena of vaccine virus interference of the influenza vaccine.  Flu Vaccine Interference  Paraphrasing, the study highlights the value of the human body’s ability to fight against viruses. Apparently, by contracting influenza, the body naturally “may reduce the risk of non-influenza respiratory viruses…”  Due to the flu vaccine’s “interference” with the naturally occurring biological process, there may be an increased risk of contracting non-influenza viruses:  “While influenza vaccination offers protection against influenza, natural influenza infection may reduce the risk of non-influenza respiratory viruses by providing temporary, non-specific immunity against these viruses. On the other hand, recently published studies have described the phenomenon of vaccine-associated virus interference; that is, vaccinated individuals may be at increased risk for other respiratory viruses because they do not receive the non-specific immunity associated with natural infection.”  Why This Topic?  I started digging into this topic on the Department of Veterans Affairs’ VA advice two weeks ago when I noticed the agency’s top advice about coronavirus was to “get a flu shot”.  This advice seemed a bit too simplistic when given to a population of largely elderly veterans with significant disabilities, vaccine histories, and exposures to various pathogens worldwide.  After writing about it, one reader sent an email citing this study in PubMed.  I was later provided a copy of the full study and reviewed it with an expert to verify my own conclusions based on the information in that report.  Informed Consent For Flu Vaccine  Now, the feedback I received that really caught my attention was mainly in a question: Is the heightened risk of coronavirus and other pathogens worth the benefit of the influenza vaccine based on this study as broken down in Table 5 above?  The column to focus on is “OR” in Table 5.  Coronavirus is 1.36 meaning 36% higher risk.  The influenza virus overall is 0.57 meaning the risk of contracting the flu was reduced overall. Three variants of flu did not receive a statistically significant reduction in risk.  Three of 8 evaluations noted a statistically insignificant benefit for the flu shot. Meanwhile, shot takers were at increased risk for coronavirus of 36%. I would bet $1 that this year, many Americans would likely rethink taking the vaccine with that bit of information.  If VA has this information, and they likely do, should the agency be required to share this increased risk factor with individuals considering the shot?  Studied Military Population  The study, published in the scientific journal Vaccine January 2020, was conducted by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch Air Force Satellite at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH.  Taken at face value, the study indicates people who receive the flu vaccine are at increased risk for coronavirus pre-COVID-19. Like veterans, current service members, school teachers, and medical professionals, the study population consisted of a population with a history of being heavily vaccinated.  “The DoD provides a unique population for vaccination studies as mandatory vaccination against influenza is required by the DoD for all Active Duty and Reserve Component personnel. This study aims to examine the relationship between specific respiratory viruses and influenza vaccination. The protocol for this study was reviewed and approved as exempt by the Air Force Research Laboratory Institutional Review Board.”  Future § 1151 Claims For Malpractice?  Will veterans who contract the coronavirus after receipt of the flu vaccine based on VA’s top recommendation be eligible for § 1151 claims for malpractice?  How will the US Court of Claims – Vaccine Court handle an influx of US citizens injured by contracting the coronavirus due to the significant risk in the study?  Given that this report was published by DOD researchers in a scientific journal, why is VA telling veterans to get the influenza vaccine?  What is the motive behind their advice?  Veterans, and many disabled veterans, may be at higher risk of contracting coronavirus based on vaccine history alone. That is especially true for veterans who took the flu vaccine at the encouragement of VA doctors.  Who stands to gain with the current recommendation?  There are winners and losers with each of these decisions. The virus itself appears to more severely impact the elderly, of which the veteran population has many.  How about Vietnam veterans exposed to toxic herbicides?  This virus is basically a death sentence for our poorly treated disabled Vietnam veterans who rely on VA to provide safe and effective medical care for their diabetes, cancer, hypertension, etc.  Ask Your Doctor  I encourage all readers to do your own research. Ask your VA medical doctor about this study and whether they agree with the blanket recommendation of the agency to get a flu shot to get ahead of coronavirus.  Is this solid medical advice?  For those interested, the study’s data came from the Department of Defense Global Respiratory Pathogen Surveillance Program DoDGRS is a DoD-wide program established by the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System GEIS.  The individuals included in the study provided respiratory specimens to the DoDGRS for 2017-2018 influenza season. Individuals who were sick prior to receipt of the flu vaccine were excluded from the study:  “All people submitting a respiratory specimen to the DoDGRS for the 2017–2018 influenza season were eligible for the study. The influenza season began 1 October 2017 and ended 29 September 2018. Those who submitted a sample and only tested positive for Chlamydia pneumoniae and/or Mycoplasma pneumoniae were excluded because these illnesses are bacteriological in nature, not viral. People with influenza and non-influenza coinfections were excluded because they could not be uniquely classified as either influenza or non-influenza respiratory virus. Individuals with multiple specimens collected during the season were also removed from the study as they could have had multiple different viruses over the season. Specimens where neither vaccination status could be obtained via databases nor a questionnaire was completed were excluded because vaccination status could not be confirmed. Subjects who were ill before receiving vaccination were excluded as vaccination status would therefore be unrelated to illness. Lastly, those people for whom the laboratory rejected the specimen were not included in the final study population.”  Be Optimistic But Careful  From what I can tell, the odds of being exposed in the US are high. The death rate if you get sick is high enough to warrant concern.  Wouldn’t it be nice to get good advice from the socialized healthcare system managed by the VA that is supposed to provide us with care?  For some non-US centric news about the virus, I wanted to include a YouTube video of 60 Minutes Australia about their perspective on the disease.  Now, this video pushes the narrative that the disease originated from the wet markets in Wuhan that also happened to be located near the level 4 biological laboratory studying the virus. I do not believe we know enough to confirm whether the origin is from such markets or manmade.  Getting Your Flu Shot?  I am personally not getting the flu shot and do not plan on taking any vaccines moving forward beyond what I was forced to take in the military due to vaccine injury.  What are your thoughts? Getting the flu shot to get ahead?"

For people with compromised immune systems, there are many natural options, and now researchers have discovered what could well be one of the best ways to reset and recharge your immune system; one that happens to be free and is believed to work even in the elderly as well.  White blood cells right help immune response, and they can be recycled through fasting, the study showed.  Three Days to a Whole New Immune System  According to researchers at the University of Southern California, the act of fasting for as little as three days can regenerate the entire immune system, even in elderly people.  The researchers said that fasting helps the body’s stem cells to begin producing new white blood cells, which help to fight off infection.  They added that the discovery could be especially effective for people suffering from damaged immune systems, including chemotherapy patients, who were protected from the toxic impacts of the treatment during the fasting period.  Flipping a “Regenerative Switch”  The researchers said that fasting helps the body’s stem cells to begin producing new white blood cells which help to fight off infection in the body.  “Fasting gives the ‘OK’ for stem cells to go ahead and begin proliferating and rebuild the entire system,” Prof. Valter Longo, Professor of Gerontology and the Biological Sciences at the University of Southern California, told the UK’s The Telegraph.  He added that the body actually removed parts that were damaged, old or inefficient during the fasting process, creating “literally, a new immune system.”  According to Dr. Longo a person’s system recycles unneeded immune cells, especially damaged ones, in order to create energy while they are fasting.  Over the course of his study’s trials, participants were asked to regularly fast between 2-4 days over a 6 month period.  The study was released in June and Dr. Longo said that clinical trials must still be completed, but added that the research looks “very promising.”  sources: telegraph, althealthworks, cell, medicalnewstoday, nationalpost, usc"

Holding virtual rallies, releasing a slew of negative ads across the airwaves nationwide, and selling facemasks emblazoned with images of the candidate’s face are just a few of the money-making schemes running for its benefit. But now, Joe Barron, head of the FBI’s Department of Detectivity says they’ve gone too far by accepting a check for thirty-one dollars from the organization called “Antifa.”  The donation, which arrived yesterday at campaign headquarters in Floppyballs, California, was confirmed to have been vetted by interns, and deposited into campaign coffers by Democrat volunteer Calypso Soros, a second cousin of the well-known billionaire. Barron detailed the possible actionable offense:  “Anything from Antifa is blood money, because they have been officially labelled an Anti-American organization by both Trumptards International and Diamond and Silk’s ‘Tents Can Be Clothes’ retail outlet stores. Accepting that money is the same as if you picked up a dollar on the street that a serial killer had dropped two days before. Sure, it seems innocent : but you’re still infected with evil. Biden might as well wear satanic cthulu robes and decapitate a chicken on top of Mother Theresa’s grave for what that thirty one dollars has done to his soul.”  So far, representitives of the Vice President’s campaign haven’t commented on what is sure to become a very serious scandal, but just like his rival Donald Trump, it will bloat and fester until one day it will no doubt explode in some Popeye’s chicken restroom."

Five international judges are examining evidence of child rape, torture, murder and kidnapping allegedly done by global elite members of the Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult network. Regular Ninth Circle child sacrifices were said to take place in the catacombs of Catholic Cathedrals, the Vatican, on private estates and groves and government military bases in Belgium, Holland, Spain, Australia, Ireland, France, England and the US. At least 34 child mass grave sites were identified in Ireland, Spain and Canada – and refused excavation by the respective governments, Crown of England and Catholic Church. Named as present in Ninth Circle activities were Pope Francis, former Pope Ratzinger;Anglican, United Church of Canada and Catholic Church officials including Cardinals; members of European royalty including Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip; officials of the Canadian, Australian, UK and US military and governments including the USA’s CIA, plus prominent government ministers, judges, politicians and businessmen from the US, Belgium, Holland, Canada, Australia, France, Ireland and the UK.  Teens were drugged, stripped naked, raped, hunted down in the woods and killed by European royals according to this week’s latest eyewitness to testify before the International Common Law Court of Justice in Brussels. The woman was the fourth eyewitness to give accounts about these human hunting parties of the global elite Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult network. A former member of the Netherlands criminal drug syndicate known as Octopus testified that victims were obtained for these human hunting parties from juvenile detention centers in Belgium and Holland.  “In 2004 I was an involuntary witness to torture, rape and murder sessions of drugged children performed for a group of high ranked people of the Netherlands” stated a woman. “I was taken to a hunting party in Belgium close to Brussels where I saw two boys and a girl ages 14 to 16, hunted and killed by global elites. The human hunting party was heavily guarded by the Netherlands Royal Guards. I was told that King Albert of Belgium was present.”  Four eyewitnesses confirmed that as children and youths they were forced to attend human hunting parties where they and other children were raped, with some killed, and deceased boy’s penises were cut off. Allegedly there was a Dutch countryside palace where boys’ penises were displayed like trophies on a wall. Some hunting parties were hosted on the grounds of Belgium Queen Beatrix’s Palace.  Dutch therapist Toos Nijenhuis claimed that as a four year-old she was forced to witness murders of children that involved former Pope Ratzinger, a Dutch Catholic Cardinal, plus the father of Netherlands Belgium Queen Beatrix and Bilderberger Founder, Dutch Crown Prince Alfrink Bernhard. “I saw the former Pope Joseph Ratzinger murder a little girl? another witness confirmed. “It was at a French chateau in the fall of 1987. It was ugly, horrible and didn’t happen just once. Ratzinger and Bernhard were some of the more prominent men who took part.”  In Ireland, Spain and Canada 34 child mass grave sites were discovered and appeared linked to Ninth Circle activities. The largest was the Mohawk Indian Residential School in Brantford Ontario where child remains were identified in 2008 before the Catholic Church, Canadian government and English Crown shut down the dig by professional archeologists. The 2013 ICLCJ Court had found Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip guilty for the Oct. 10 1964 disappearance of ten native children from the Catholic residential school in Kamloops British Columbia. In the first two weeks of the 2014 court witnesses identified Dutch and Belgian royal participants in the rape and killing of Mohawk children and newborns. Named were Bernhard and King Hendrick, consort to Queen Wilhelmina of Holland.  Alleged to be present during the human hunting parties were the late Prince Johan Friso and his wife Mabel Wisse Smit, former ministers, the top man of the Dutch army, the under secretary of the Raad Van State in the Netherlands, the Vice-Roy next to Queen Beatrix and other global business and political leaders including some from the US. “Surely the present King Willem Alexander and King Filip and their wives know about this abuse and murder of children” said one eyewitness.”They do nothing about it and likely are the ones to stop investigations and prosecutions.”  In January 2014 the brother of the king of Holland Prince Johan Friso passed away in a coma after these three Dutch-language websites shown here reached the internet. The websites revealed that Friso was at the human hunting and killing parties.”The story came on the internet after years of trying to move the policy and justice department in the Netherlands to act against the criminals,” an eyewitness said. “Nobody did anything to stop these criminals, probably because Queen Beatrix and King Albert likely interfered with the investigations.”  Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.  Human hunting parties were said to take place on the grounds of Belgium Queen Beatrix’s Palace in the Netherlands. Two witnesses have named former Pope Joseph Ratzinger and Queen Beatrix’s father the deceased Prince Alfrink Bernhard, as being present at child sacrifices. Both were said to be Nazi sympathizers.  The ICLCJ Court received a collection of Jesuit archival records about a child sacrificial cult known as the Knights of Darkness. In 1933 the Knights were established by the Catholic Jesuits and Nazi Waffen S.S. Division. The records showed Ratzinger was identified as a member of the Knights while working as an S.S. Chaplain’s assistant at the Ravensbruck Concentration Camp in Germany. The records also stated that Ratzinger participated in child sacrificial rites using kidnapped children from the camps or political prisoners.  Another court document called the Magisterial Privilege indicated child sacrifice was a regular occurrence at the Vatican. At the tender age of 12 “Svali” of San Diego County California claimed she was brought to catacombs beneath the Vatican to witness the sacrifice of a three year-old drugged boy. In this video her interviewer said that 24 years prior a “Maria” told him she witnessed another satanic child sacrifice rite in the same Vatican Catacombs.  Last week an Irish police investigator reported to the ICLCJ Court that the close to 800 babies buried in a Catholic Nun’s septic tank were dismembered, decapitated and in bits and pieces – signs that they could have been murdered in Satanic child sacrifice rites. In the last two months the ICLCJ Court has heard these heart-wrenching testimonies about the rape, torture and murder of children as recently as 2010 by Catholic leaders, European royal family members and other global elites. Murder sites of the Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult were said to be in the catacombs of Catholic Cathedrals including the Vatican and on private estates, military establishments and groves in Belgium, Holland, Spain, Australia, France, England and the US.  The ICLCJ Court has been overwhelmed with newly discovered evidence and a number of new witnesses coming forward to testify about Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult activities. They have uncovered Ninth Circle Satanic Cult member possible involvement in international child sacrifice, kidnapping, exploitation and drug rings. The five international judges and 27 jury members were expected to remain in session for at least a year due to the complexity of the cases.  Amnesty has been offered to citizens or employees of the Vatican, Crown of England, churches or governments willing to give sworn testimony or evidence that leads to the prosecution of these global elites suspected of committing crimes. Rewards up to 10,000 euros or around 13,660 dollars was available through the ICLCJ court.  The ICLCJ Court had over 450 Common Law Peace Officers in 13 countries, with 51 local chartered groups operating. Local organizing funds were available for common law groups that applied through the International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State.

Physicians have demonstrated the powerful antiviral action of vitamin C for decades. There has been a lack of media coverage of this effective and successful approach against viruses in general, and coronavirus in particular.  It is very important to maximize the body’s anti-oxidative capacity and natural immunity to prevent and minimize symptoms when a virus attacks the human body. The host environment is crucial. Preventing is obviously easier than treating severe illness.  But treat serious illness seriously. Do not hesitate to seek medical attention. It is not an either-or choice. Vitamin C can be used right along with medicines when they are indicated.  “I have not seen any flu yet that was not cured or markedly ameliorated by massive doses of vitamin C.” Robert F. Cathcart, MD  The physicians of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service and the International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine urge a nutrient-based method to prevent or minimize symptoms for future viral infection. The following inexpensive supplemental levels are recommended for adults; for children reduce these in proportion to body weight:  Vitamin C: 3,000 milligrams or more daily, in divided doses.  Vitamin D3: 2,000 International Units daily. Start with 5,000 IU/day for two weeks, then reduce to 2,000  Magnesium: 400 mg daily in citrate, malate, chelate, or chloride form  Zinc: 20 mg daily  Selenium: 100 mcg micrograms daily  Vitamin C [1] , Vitamin D [2] , magnesium [3] , zinc [4] , and selenium [5] have been shown to strengthen the immune system against viruses.  The basis for using high doses of vitamin C to prevent and combat virus-caused illness may be traced back to vitamin C’s early success against polio, first reported in the late 1940s. [6] Many people are unaware, even surprised, to learn this. Further clinical evidence built up over the decades, leading to an anti-virus protocol published in 1980. [7]  It is important to remember that preventing and treating respiratory infections with large amounts of vitamin C is well established. Those who believe that vitamin C generally has merit, but massive doses are ineffective or somehow harmful, will do well to read the original papers for themselves. To dismiss the work of these doctors simply because they had success so long ago sidesteps a more important question: Why has the benefit of their clinical experience not been presented to the public by responsible governmental authorities, especially in the face of a viral pandemic?

Migration Watch says this would cut net migration - the difference between the number of people arriving and leaving - from 180,000 to 65,000 a year.  But James McGrory, from the pro-EU Britain Stronger In Europe campaign, called the report disingenuous.  He said it was another example of fudging the facts.      Follow the latest updates with BBC Politics Live  The UK is set to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether or not it should remain a member of the European Union.

It would depend on the terms of a new settlement that might take months to negotiate and years to put into place.  But say, as Migration Watch advocates, that it did herald controls on the flow of low-skilled EU migrant labour, would that really work in reducing net migration?  Wouldn't there be an influx of migrants from the EU before the restrictions came into force?  Wouldn't businesses that currently rely on labourers, chambermaids and supermarket shelf-stackers from Europe demand that they be allowed to recruit them from elsewhere?  And wouldn't the EU introduce work permits for British workers, thereby reducing emigration from the UK?  These are questions that need answers in the months leading up to the referendum. lineimage copyrightNot Specified 'Pressure on services'  The report suggested the key change could be the introduction of work permits which would limit EU nationals entering the country to higher-skilled workers, their family members and students, while low-skilled workers would not be granted entry.  Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch, said: It is time to examine possible alternative immigration regimes.  Under the current arrangements, signs indicated migration to Britain would continue at a substantial rate for the foreseeable future, he said.  Indeed, immigrants tend to generate further migration as their friends and relatives join them in their new countries, he said.  Work permits for EU citizens would substantially reduce net migration and its resultant pressure on our population and public services.  The 16-page paper suggests that on average only about 20% of EU migrants who came to Britain between 2004 and 2014 were doing higher-skilled work.  It said: This could substantially reduce the EU inflow for work to perhaps one fifth of its recent level and would, in turn, substantially reduce net migration by perhaps 100,000 a year from the current level of 180,000. Graph showing long-term international migration to the UK  The figures should not be taken as a precise estimate but were intended to illustrate the scale of the potential reduction under the policy outlined, it said.  There would be no need for restrictions on EU citizens coming to the UK as students or tourists, the authors concluded.  Those who are self-sufficient would also be free to live in Britain, including those who are looking for jobs. 'No evidence'  Under the suggested system there would also be no restriction on EU family members of British citizens coming to join them, while relatives of European skilled workers and students would have the right to live and work in the UK.  Those EU citizens already living and working in the UK would retain their existing rights, Migration Watch suggested.  However, pro-EU campaigner Mr McGrory said: Right now, Britain has the best of both worlds. We have an opt-out from the passport-free Schengen area, while still enjoying full access to the single market.  The Leave campaigns haven't produced a shred of evidence to show how they could guarantee a deal that is at least as good if we left.  The Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said if it became harder for employers to recruit EU workers they may try to bring in more migrants from outside Europe.  Most recent estimated net migration to the UK reached a record 336,000 in the year to June 2015 according to Office for National Statistics ONS figures  "

Redding CA— A new peer-reviewed study in the journal SAGE Open Medicine details the health outcomes of vaccinated versus unvaccinated children from three pediatric practices in the United States concludes that unvaccinated children have better health outcomes than their vaccinated peers.  Children in the study were followed continuously for a minimum of 3 years from birth. The study was based on medical records of over 2000 children enrolled in three pediatric practices and born between November 2005 and June 2015. Vaccination status was determined based on any vaccination received prior to one year of age which yielded 30.9% of the children in the unvaccinated group. Results show that vaccination before one year of age led to significantly increased odds of medical diagnoses of developmental delays, asthma and ear infections in children.  In a separate analysis, based on the number of vaccines received by one year of age, children receiving more vaccines were more likely to be diagnosed with gastrointestinal disorders compared to those who received no vaccines within the same timeframe. In temporal analyses, children vaccinated prior to six months of age showed significant risks of each of the disorders studied as compared to unvaccinated children in the same timeframe.  The study, coauthored by Dr. Brian Hooker and Mr. Neil Miller, is unique in that all diagnoses were verified using abstracted medical records from each of the participating pediatric practices. Lead author of the study, Dr. Hooker, stated, “The results definitely indicate better health outcomes in children who did not receive vaccines within their first year of life. These findings are consistent with additional research that has identified vaccination as a risk factor for a variety of adverse health outcomes . Such findings merit additional large-scale study of vaccinated and unvaccinated children in order to provide optimal health as well as protection against infectious diseases.”  ###"

Janda’s guest in his latest broadcast is a former high-level intelligence official Lt. Gen. Tom McInerney who warns that the Dems and the CIA have put in place a mechanism which can alter the voting results of electronic voting machines in key swing states like Pennsylvania that will determine the outcome of the election.  This covert technology is called Operation Scorecard, and it was built by the CIA to surreptitiously steal elections in targeted countries. Now, that technology is being turned against the United States of America and is about to be activated on Tuesday to steal the election for Biden, explains Janda’s guest.  OmegaManRadio, a pro-liberty, pro-Christian podcast channel, has reposted portions of the Dave Janda interview at this link on Soundcloud.com. Start listening around the 20 minute mark to hear the bombshell segments.  The original interview from Dave Janda is currently available via YouTube but is likely to be blacklisted soon. Here’s the YouTube embed:  As McInerney explains in the video, after the closing of polls in Pennsylvania and other swing states, the voting machines will be intercepted and then altered using complex algorithms to alter the votes in a way that evades detection, handing a victory to the pre-designated “winner” Joe Biden.  Smells like FREEDOM. Order Founders Blend Organic Coffee from Freedom First Coffee. Use NOQ as the promo code for 10% off!  In the interview, he explains that a covert app called “Scorecard” steals votes by making sure Democrats always stay about 3% ahead of their Republican rivals. “Scorecard steals the elections by tampering with the computers at the transfer points,” he adds.  This also explains why Joe Biden recently said, with great clarity, “We have put together I think the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics.”  Here’s the video of Biden bragging about the massive voter fraud system that’s being used to try to to steal the election for him:  This might also help explain why Joe Biden told voters at a recent small rally that he didn’t “need their vote” to become President, and why Nancy Pelosi says Biden will win no matter what the votes say on Nov. 3rd.  The deep state has a plan in place to steal this election by altering votes in key swing states. And if Trump challenges the fraud, he will be condemned for “refusing to accept the outcome” of the rigged election. This is the narrative trap that has been set by the treasonous mainstream media.  Keep in mind that just over the last two days, Trump campaign officials were asking for detailed information about how voting machines are handled in Pennsylvania. According to the anti-Trump Washington Post a deep state propaganda mouthpiece:  …the Trump campaign asked officials in Cumberland County for the names of people who transport ballots and voting machines once polls close, the names of people who have access to the ballots afterward, and the precise locations where the ballots are stored, including room numbers.  It seems that Trump’s people are already aware that Dems are working to fraudulently steal this election by altering votes in Pennsylvania, and they’re trying to stop it.  Be aware that unless Trump receives an overwhelming wave of votes on Tuesday — beyond the margin of Democrat fraud — the Dems have a mechanism in place to steal the election, condemn Trump for challenging the vote theft, and seizing control of the White House from this day forward.  Spread this story far and wide. Everything is now at stake.  RED ALERT: Dems collude with CIA to launch intelligence operation that ALTERS voting machine results in Pennsylvania and other swing states  Update:  COVID-19 may take down an independent news outlet  Nobody said running a media site would be easy. We could use some help keeping this site afloat.  Colleagues have called me the worst fundraiser ever. My skills are squarely rooted on the journalistic side of running a news outlet. Paying the bills has never been my forte, but we’ve survived. We have ads on the site that help, but since the site’s inception this has been a labor of love that otherwise doesn’t bring in the level of revenue necessary to justify it.  When I left a nice, corporate career in 2017, I did so knowing I wouldn’t make nearly as much money. But what we do at NOQ Report to deliver the truth and fight the progressive mainstream media narrative that has plagued this nation is too important for me to sacrifice it for the sake of wealth. We know we’ll never make a ton of money this way, and we’re okay with that.  Things have become harder with the coronavirus lockdowns. Both ad money and donations that have kept us afloat for a while have dropped dramatically. We thought we could weather the storm, but the so-called “surge” or “2nd-wave” that mainstream media and Democrats are pushing has put our prospects in jeopardy. In short, we are now in desperate need of financial assistance.  The best way NOQ Report readers can help is to donate. Our Giving Fuel page makes it easy to donate one-time or monthly. Alternatively, you can donate through PayPal as well. We need approximately $11,500 to stay afloat for the rest of 2020, but more would be wonderful and any amount that brings us closer to our goal is greatly appreciated.  The second way to help is to become a partner. We’ve strongly considered seeking angel investors in the past but because we were paying the bills, it didn’t seem necessary. Now, we’re struggling to pay the bills. This shouldn’t be the case as our traffic the last year has been going up dramatically. June, 2018, we had 11,678 visitors. A year later in June, 2019, we were up to 116,194. In June, 2020, we had 614,192. We’re heading in the right direction and we believe we’re ready talk to patriotic investors who want to not only “get in on the action” but more importantly who want to help America hear the truth. Interested investors should contact me directly with the contact button above.  Election year or not, coronavirus lockdowns or not, anarchic riots or not, the need for truthful journalism endures. But in these times, we need as many conservative media voices as possible. Please help keep NOQ Report going.  Join fellow patriots as we form a grassroots movement to advance the cause of conservatism. The coronavirus crisis has prompted many, even some conservatives, to promote authoritarianism. It’s understandable to some extent now, but it must not be allowed to embed itself in American life. We currently have 8000+ patriots with us in a very short time.

165,165,other,"Reasons why the 2020 presidential election is deeply puzzling To say out-loud that you find the results of the 2020 presidential election odd is to invite derision. You must be a crank or a conspiracy theorist. Mark me down as a crank, then. I am a pollster and I find this election to be deeply puzzling. I also think that the Trump campaign is still well within its rights to contest the tabulations. Something very strange happened in America’s democracy in the early hours of Wednesday November 4 and the days that followed. It’s reasonable for a lot of Americans to want to find out exactly what.  First, consider some facts. President Trump received more votes than any previous incumbent seeking reelection. He got 11 million more votes than in 2016, the third largest rise in support ever for an incumbent. By way of comparison, President Obama was comfortably reelected in 2012 with 3.5 million fewer votes than he received in 2008.  Trump’s vote increased so much because, according to exit polls, he performed far better with many key demographic groups. Ninety-five percent of Republicans voted for him. He did extraordinarily well with rural male working-class whites.  Trump grew his support among black voters by 50 percent over 2016. Nationally, Joe Biden’s black support fell well below 90 percent, the level below which Democratic presidential candidates usually lose.  Trump increased his share of the national Hispanic vote to 35 percent. With 60 percent or less of the national Hispanic vote, it is arithmetically impossible for a Democratic presidential candidate to win Florida, Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico. Bellwether states swung further in Trump’s direction than in 2016. Florida, Ohio and Iowa each defied America’s media polls with huge wins for Trump. Since 1852, only Richard Nixon has lost the Electoral College after winning this trio, and that 1960 defeat to John F. Kennedy is still the subject of great suspicion.  Midwestern states Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin always swing in the same direction as Ohio and Iowa, their regional peers. Ohio likewise swings with Florida. Current tallies show that, outside of a few cities, the Rust Belt swung in Trump’s direction. Yet, Biden leads in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin because of an apparent avalanche of black votes in Detroit, Philadelphia, and Milwaukee. Biden’s ‘winning’ margin was derived almost entirely from such voters in these cities, as coincidentally his black vote spiked only in exactly the locations necessary to secure victory. He did not receive comparable levels of support among comparable demographic groups in comparable states, which is highly unusual for the presidential victor.  We are told that Biden won more votes nationally than any presidential candidate in history. But he won a record low of 17 percent of counties; he only won 524 counties, as opposed to the 873 counties Obama won in 2008. Yet, Biden somehow outdid Obama in total votes.  Victorious presidential candidates, especially challengers, usually have down-ballot coattails; Biden did not. The Republicans held the Senate and enjoyed a ‘red wave’ in the House, where they gained a large number of seats while winning all 27 toss-up contests. Trump’s party did not lose a single state legislature and actually made gains at the state level.  Another anomaly is found in the comparison between the polls and non-polling metrics. The latter include: party registrations trends; the candidates’ respective primary votes; candidate enthusiasm; social media followings; broadcast and digital media ratings; online searches; the number of especially small donors; and the number of individuals betting on each candidate.  Despite poor recent performances, media and academic polls have an impressive 80 percent record predicting the winner during the modern era. But, when the polls err, non-polling metrics do not; the latter have a 100 percent record. Every non-polling metric forecast Trump’s reelection. For Trump to lose this election, the mainstream polls needed to be correct, which they were not. Furthermore, for Trump to lose, not only did one or more of these metrics have to be wrong for the first time ever, but every single one had to be wrong, and at the very same time; not an impossible outcome, but extremely unlikely nonetheless.  Atypical voting patterns married with misses by polling and non-polling metrics should give observers pause for thought. Adding to the mystery is a cascade of information about the bizarre manner in which so many ballots were accumulated and counted.  The following peculiarities also lack compelling explanations:  1. Late on election night, with Trump comfortably ahead, many swing states stopped counting ballots. In most cases, observers were removed from the counting facilities. Counting generally continued without the observers  2. Statistically abnormal vote counts were the new normal when counting resumed. They were unusually large in size hundreds of thousands and had an unusually high 90 percent and above Biden-to-Trump ratio  3. Late arriving ballots were counted. In Pennsylvania, 23,000 absentee ballots have impossible postal return dates and another 86,000 have such extraordinary return dates they raise serious questions  4. The failure to match signatures on mail-in ballots. The destruction of mail-in ballot envelopes, which must contain signatures  5. Historically low absentee ballot rejection rates despite the massive expansion of mail voting. Such is Biden’s narrow margin that, as political analyst Robert Barnes observes, ‘If the states simply imposed the same absentee ballot rejection rate as recent cycles, then Trump wins the election’  6. Missing votes. In Delaware County, Pennsylvania, 50,000 votes held on 47 USB cards are missing  7. Non-resident voters. Matt Braynard’s Voter Integrity Project estimates that 20,312 people who no longer met residency requirements cast ballots in Georgia. Biden’s margin is 12,670 votes"

The news comes after a landmark ruling in October stated Uber drivers are employees, not self-employed as the company had claimed. The judgment could entitle thousands of “gig economy” workers to holiday pay and a guaranteed minimum wage.  The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain IWGB has demanded recognition from Deliveroo so that the union can bargain for pay and conditions on workers’ behalf. The deal will initially cover Camden in north London and will be rolled out nationwide if successful.  Recommended Read more Uber ordered to pay drivers minimum wage in landmark case  If half of drivers in the area sign up, Deliveroo will be forced to recognise the union. It will be the first collective bargaining agreement in the “gig economy”, setting a precedent for others to demand further rights.  Deliveroo has 10 business days to respond, after which an application will be submitted to the Central Arbitration Committee CAC asking it to force Deliveroo into collective bargaining.  IWGB general secretary Jason Moyer-Lee said: “Of course, for the CAC to entertain our request they will need to decide that Deliveroo drivers are ‘workers’ and not the ‘independent contractors’ you have bogusly deemed them to be,” Moyer-Lee said.  “Deliveroo drivers work for Deliveroo and as such they should be entitled to paid holiday, minimum wage, trade union rights, and all the other rights associated with worker status.”  Please enter your email address Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP Thanks for signing up to the News newsletter {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our privacy notice  Experts said the case could be hugely significant. Aaron Hayward, employment specialist at DJM Solicitors said it was “no surprise” the drivers were taking action after the Uber case.“The explosion of the gig economy means many thousands of workers across the UK are now engaged in temporary, casual work that doesn’t entitle them to paid holiday, minimum wage and other rights, because they are officially classified as ‘contractors’,” he said.  If the drivers are successful, Deliveroo will be the “first app-based employer to recognise a union in the UK. First they must succeed in convincing a tribunal that drivers should be reclassified as employees as opposed to contractors as collective bargaining laws only apply to employees.  “This is an employment case that employers, workers and lawyers alike will be watching with interest. As we move more towards a ‘gig economy’ based on short-term, software-driven casual work, this issue isn’t going to away anytime soon.”  Deliveroo delivers food from thousands of restaurants which do not have their own delivery service such as Pizza Express, Byron and Gourmet Burger Kitchen.  Drivers receive £3.75 per delivery under a new pilot scheme, but some have allege they wait up to an hour for a delivery, meaning their take-home pay is less than minimum wage. This is legal if the workers are self-employed, but many say it amounts to exploitation.

167,167,other,"Merck Scraps COVID Vaccines; Says It’s More Effective To Get The Virus And Recover Vaccine manufacturer Merck has abandoned development of two coronavirus vaccines, saying that after extensive research it was concluded that the shots offered less protection than just contracting the virus itself and developing antibodies. The company announced that the shots V590 and V591 were ‘well tolerated’ by test patients, however they generated an ‘inferior’ immune system response in comparison with natural infection. The company stated that instead it will focus on research into therapeutic drugs labeled as MK-7110 and MK-4482. The drugs aim to protect patients from the damage of an overactive immune response to the virus. “Interim results from a Phase 3 study showed a greater than 50 percent reduction in the risk of death or respiratory failure in patients hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19,” the company’s statement noted of the MK-7110 drug. Merck is to receive around $356 million from the US government to fast-track production of the potential treatments under Operation Warp Speed.

In an effort to make sure its member states get their ‘fair share’ of vaccines, the EU has also threatened to block the delivery of Pfizer vaccines to the UK, demanding that drug companies provide detailed information on when they plan to export Covid jabs to countries outside the bloc."

And they won’t do that because in the United States, truth is an absolute defense against slander.”  This must-watch video details the many problems with the development and safety of Merck’s third-highest grossing product, Gardasil. Children’s Health Defense CHD and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., CHD’s Chairman and Chief Legal Counsel, ask that you watch and share this video so that you, and others, may make an informed decision of whether or not to give your child, boy or girl, a Gardasil vaccine. It can also be a useful tool for pediatricians who are trying to understand how this vaccine, that is actually causing health problems with young people, could have been approved by FDA and then recommended by CDC. The video is full of jaw-dropping facts about Gardasil and the clinical trials leading up to its release upon an unsuspecting public.  Transcript of “The Science” presentation:  Download “The Science” Transcript  Children’s Health Defense and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—Science Day Presentation for Gardasil  Hi, I’m Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and I’m making this video for the sake of parents who are trying to make an informed decision of whether or not to give their child, their boy or girl the Gardasil vaccine.  I’m also making this video as a tool for pediatricians who are trying to understand how this vaccine—if it’s actually causing all of these problems with young girls—could have been approved by FDA and then mandated by CDC.  Virtually all of the things that I’m going to talk about in this video are available to the public on public documents as I’m going to show.  Finally, I want to say this about Merck which is the company that makes the Gardasil vaccine.  Many of the things that I’m going to say today would be slanderous if they were not true. And if they’re not true then Merck should sue me. But Merck won’t do that and they won’t do it because in the United States truth is an absolute defense to slander. And second of all Merck knows that if they sue me, I’m going to immediately file a discovery request, and many, many, more documents are going to emerge that illustrate even more fraud by this company on the American public and the people all over the world.  Finally, as a footnote I’m not going to talk today about the specific biological mechanisms that allow this vaccine to cause harm in human beings. That information is out there it’s in dozens of peer-reviewed, published scientific documents. Many of these are described on our website and I urge people to go to the Children’s Health Defense website to educate themselves on those issues.  Today we’re going to talk about the clinical trial about Merck’s fraud in that process…and this is Merck’s claim:  The HPV vaccine will “eliminate cervical cancers and other HPV associated cancers.”  The danger of dying from HPV cancer in this country is 1 death in 43.5 thousand people.  Imagine you have a deck of cards but instead of 50 cards. There’s 43,500 on a on a big, big table and one of those cards is a black card. If you get that, you die.  So, Merck’s deal is that it’s going to remove that black card from the deck. But in order to play the game and make sure that Merck removes the black card, everybody who participates has to put in $420 because that’s the cost of the three-dose Gardasil vaccine.  So, here’s Gardasil by the numbers. So, the cost of the three-jab series average is about $420. There are 76 million children who essentially have been mandated by CDC to receive these vaccines. A blockbuster product from Merck, and global revenues from this vaccine today are about $2.3 billion dollars. It’s the third largest product in the company’s inventory.  The cost of saving one American life is 18.3 million dollars. People could argue whether or not that’s a reasonable value of a human life. What I would say was is that the criteria that we should use for evaluating reasonableness—is there a cheaper way to save more lives? And people would argue that Pap smears are the most effective way that 80 percent of cervical cancer deaths have already been eliminated by Pap smears. And this is the most effective technology.  Incidentally in another context HHS has already put a value on human life and the value is $250k. That is the maximum number that the vaccine compensation program will pay for killing an American citizen.  Prior to marketing the vaccine, the FDA licenses the vaccine, and in that licensing process Merck had to show that the vaccine was safe. According to Federal regulations the word “safety” means “relative freedom from harmful effects, taking into consideration the character of the product in relationship to the condition of the recipient at that time.”  So, what is the condition of the recipients of that target group for this vaccine. And this vaccine targets millions of preteens and teens, for whom the risk of dying from cervical cancer is practically zero. Cervical cancer’s median age of death is 58. It is first diagnosed at age 50 median.  A teenage girl or boy has zero chance of dying of this illness. Which means the threshold for giving this medication is very, very high.  Secondly it is mandated in some jurisdictions So the government is actually—government officials are actually—coming in and ordering people to take this medical intervention. So, we have to be sure that the threshold for risk, “the risk profile” for that medical intervention should be very, very low.  Third, unlike other medical interventions Gardasil recipients are perfectly healthy. So, when you give medication to a healthy individual you have to make sure that the risk profile is practically zero. And in order to determine risk, there is a standardized protocol. And it’s called double-blind placebo studies. What does that mean?  It means that the drug company that’s trying to license this product gives the medication to one group of people, maybe 5,000 or 10,000 people, and gives a placebo, an inert placebo, either an identical looking pill that is inert—it’s either saline or sugar—to a similarly situated group of 5,000 or 10,000 people and it’s double blind meaning that neither the patients nor the researchers knew who got the placebo and who got the actual medication.  And you can see here, here’s what the NIH says about the National Institute for Health placebos: an inactive substance that looks like a drug.  So here are typical examples:  Lipitor was given during its study phase to about 17k subjects. Half of them received Lipitor half of them received a sugar pill that looked identical to Lipitor and they were observed and studied for up to 3.3 years.  Why for so long? Because many of the injuries that are caused by medication are latent—they don’t show up for two or three or four or five years cancer for example may not show up for four or five years after the exposure. Autoimmune diseases and allergies and these kind of things take a long time to diagnose. Enbrel for that reason was delayed for 6.6 years and against a control group that received a saline injection.  Botox, there was a national emergency to get Botox to market so people could get their wrinkles cured, was studied for 51 weeks and it was studied against a saline injection.  Now I’m going to show you one of the really outrageous frauds that Merck committed during the clinical trials. This is an insert that is part of every vaccine package. And you can go on the Internet right now and look up that Merck product and search and find these two tables.  In the initial table you can see a there are three columns and this is a table that just looks at injuries at the vaccine site for redness and itching and bruising and pain at the vaccine site and they use one…there were 5,000 girls—5,088 girls who got the Gardasil vaccine.  Number two, there were 3,470 girls who got the AAHS control, what is that? That is the adjuvant in the vaccine. That is a toxic neurotoxin, that’s put in the vaccine to make it more long-lasting to provoke an immune response in the subject of the vaccine.  And most people believe that it is that aluminum adjuvant that is causing all of these injuries in the girls who are getting the vaccine. And there were 3,470 people who received just the neurotoxin with no antigens and no other vaccine components.  And you have a third group which is the placebo group. What I want you to look at is at these numbers. That in the Gardasil and AAHS control there is virtually the same number of injuries.  And when you get to the saline placebo, that injury rate is cut in half.  Now let’s go to the table where they talk about real systemic injuries…autoimmune diseases, and instead of showing us real science, which is to show us what happened to the saline group, they hide the saline group as a way of fooling you, your pediatrician and the regulatory agency by compressing it into the aluminum group and they never tell us. They say this is a combination of the aluminum adjuvant and the saline placebo. They don’t tell us how many in each category were compressed there. The real thing that you need to watch here is what happened.  These are all very, very serious injuries. These are injuries that in some cases people would feel were worse than death—and that affect people and debilitate for a lifetime in many cases.  And if you look at the bottom of the Gardasil group an astonishing 2.3 percent of the girls in the clinical study who received the Gardasil vaccine got ill from autoimmune diseases, many within seven months of taking the vaccine.  And look what happened in the aluminum group—the same number exactly. 2.3 percent.  Nobody, no parent would allow their daughter to take a substance that had a one-in-40 chance of giving them a lifetime disability.  World Health Organization says that using a spiked placebo, or a faux-cebo as Merck did with Gardasil, puts you at a methodological disadvantage that “it may be difficult or impossible to assess vaccine safety.”  Dr. Stanley Plotkin, who developed the polio vaccine…who developed the pertussis vaccine, who developed the rotavirus vaccine—the Stanley Plotkin award is the Nobel Prize of vaccinology it’s given to the top vaccinologist every year—and what he says is:  Unless you have a true control group you are in LA LA LAND.  Finally, the American Medical Association says the absence of double-blind placebo testing and short-term studies of chronic disease are “the indicia of marketing masquerading as science.”  And that’s what Merck gave us.  The Cochrane Collaboration—thirty thousand scientists from all over the world who came together to create an independent assessment of medical protocols which they saw as being increasingly controlled by the industry—The Cochrane Collaboration said the use of active comparators probably increased the occurrence of harms and the comparative group thereby masking harms created by the HPV vaccine.  And that indeed was Merck’s point…to hide those harms.  So, if you do the math women are 100 times more likely to suffer serious adverse events from the Gardasil vaccine than they are to be protected from cervical cancer.  So now we have a very different bargain in this card game that we’re playing with Merck.  If 43 thousand cards and the black card—the death card is gone—but now, there are a thousand blue cards which if you pick one of those by mistake you have a good chance of getting an autoimmune disease. Nobody would take that bargain.  So, in order to get the FDA license to market this vaccine Merck did a number of studies, which are called protocols. We don’t know how many they did because they’re not telling us they never disclosed it.  The one we’re most concerned with is protocol 18. The reason protocol 18 is critical is because that was the basis for FDA giving Merck the license to produce and market the vaccine.  Why is that? Because protocol 18 is the only one in which the target audience for this vaccine. 11- and 12-year old girls was actually tested, and had a control group. The other ones looked at big cohorts of women were 16 to 25-year old and 16 to 26-year old women.  Protocol 18 looked at girls and boys from ages 9 to 15. It was a total of 1200 children. and almost 600 controls. That is a very, very, tiny group of people to study in order to determine the safety of a product is going to be marketed to billions of children around the world.  Now I’m going to show you one of the key fraudulent flimflams that Merck used to get this license. FDA said they approved Gardasil based on protocol 18 because protocol 18 was of particular interest because it’s the only protocol in which Merck used a true saline placebo instead of the aluminum adjuvant as a control.  That’s what Merck told FDA and the CDC but Merck was lying. It actually did not use a true saline placebo. It used what Merck called the “carrier solution.” Which is all of the components of the vaccine except for the aluminum and the viral particles the antigen.  Among the compounds that we know were in the carrier solution are Polysorbate 80 which we have no idea what the safety profile is because it’s never been tested for safety independently in vaccines. Sodium borate which is borax which is banned by FDA in food products and all food products in the United States, and is banned altogether in Europe, genetically modified yeast, there’s no safety test ever been done on it in vaccines L-histidine, the same, and possibly DNA fragments.  I say possibly because we know there are DNA fragments in the final vaccine, we don’t know how they got there. And Merck has lied about the DNA fragments from the outset.  And despite these potentially toxic components of compounds that are in the vaccine, the 596 children that were given the carrier solution fared much better in the other than any other cohort in the study. The girls and boys who receive the carrier solution were the only significant cohorts with no serious adverse events for the first 15 days.  And here’s another one of the gravamen of the fraud that Merck committed in its Gardasil trials, but it turns out in the protocol 18 study, it appears Merck cut the amount of aluminum that was given to the vaccine group in half. They tested a completely different formulation. If true, we theorize that they took the aluminum out to reduce the number of injuries and to mask the really bad safety profile of this vaccine.  And since the protocol 18 data are not based on the Gardasil vaccine formulation, the trial itself constitutes rank scientific fraud.  Here’s another bag of tricks that was used by Merck in order to skew the clinical trials results in favor of Gardasil.  Merck and its researchers use what they call exclusion criteria—for example people who had zero allergies, people who had prior genital infections were thrown out of the clinical trials. People who had over four sex partners in their entire lives were excluded from the trials. Anybody who had a history of immunological or nervous system disorders, people with chronic illnesses and seizure disorders, people with other medical conditions, people who had reactions to vaccine ingredients including the aluminum, yeast and the benzonase. or anybody with a history of alcohol and drug abuse.  If you really wanted to know whether the vaccine was helping people—if it was effective—wouldn’t you want those people in your study wouldn’t you want people who had a genetic vulnerability to cancer in your study to see if it actually was capable of preventing cancer.  Then Merck had one catch all exclusion category which was any condition which in the opinion of the investigator might interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives. Well, that gave Merck and its paid investigators complete control to throw people out of the study who they thought might make the study look not successful. All of these exclusionary categories gave Merck the ability to limit the study to people who were like All of these exclusionary categories gave Merck the ability to limit this study to people who were like an elite club of superheroes…the people who get the vaccine are not the same people they tested on. They tested it on the Avengers. They didn’t test it on, you know, Joe Bag-of-Donuts … the people are actually receiving this vaccine in day to day life. And by doing that they were able to mask whatever injury might show up in a larger and more vulnerable population who are actually receiving the vaccine.  Experts used an arsenal of sloppy protocols to again, hide vaccine injuries. Among these, Merck gave report cards—the daily journal report cards— only to 10 percent of the people who they tested the vaccine on and told those people only make reports for 14 days after the injection. And the report cards were only designed to collect jab site information. So, redness, itching, bruising, fever.  And they ignored altogether the autoimmune diseases and menstrual cycle problems and fertility problems and pain and dizziness and seizures and all of the other things that we’ve now seen are associated with the vaccine. In fact, there are numerous girls who report that they were injured that they attempted to report those injuries to Merck, and that Merck rebuffed them.  Furthermore, Merck gave extraordinary discretion to its researchers to determine what was a vaccine injury in what was not a vaccine injury and because there was no inert placebo, it was completely within their discretion. If a girl came back with seizures or autoimmune disease or menstrual cycle problems they could just say to the girl, well that’s not related to the vaccine.  In some cases, we know that Merck actively covered up and lied about injuries that it had a duty to report to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. For example, in the case of Christina Tarsell, a Maryland girl, who died from the Gardasil vaccine, Merck lied about that death in its official reports of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. It told the system that Christina’s doctor had told Merck that her death was the result of a virus.  And the doctor adamantly denies that. Merck has refused to remove the misinformation from the VAERS system.  Furthermore, Merck lied to the girls who participated in these studies, telling them No.1, that the placebo was saline and that it contained no other ingredients. And No. 2, that the study in which they were participating was not a safety study. They were told that there had already been safety studies and that the vaccine had been proven safe.  What did this do for Merck? It made it so the girls were less likely to report injuries associated with the vaccine. Because they believed that the vaccine that they were receiving had already been proven safe and that any injuries they did experience maybe a month or two months or three months after the vaccine must be simply coincidental and had nothing to do with the vaccine.  Despite all of these efforts by Merck to discourage those from reporting vaccine injuries during the clinical trials, half of the girls in the Gardasil group and half of them in the aluminum adjuvant group reported serious injuries after receiving the vaccine.  In order to conceal the link between these injuries and the vaccine, Merck invented a brand new medical metric that had never been heard of before called “new medical conditions” and it dismissed all of these new injuries which affected 50 percent of the girls who received the vaccine and the adjuvant as “new medical conditions”, unrelated to the vaccines, simply sad coincidences.  Many of these diseases were serious diseases—blood lymphatic diseases, anemia, endocrine diseases, autoimmune diseases, G.I., Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, vaginal infections musculoskeletal injuries, arthritis, neoplasm, Hodgkin’s disease, neurological diseases, psychiatric diseases, depression, reproductive and breast disorders, menstrual irregularities, and pain. Over 3 percent of the girls—1 in 30—in both groups required surgical and medical procedures.  So, this card game that we’re playing with Merck has now become a really bad bet.  Merck has removed the one black card but you now have a 1 in 40 chance of drawing a blue card and getting an autoimmune disease that may afflict you for the rest of your life and you have a 1 in 2 chance of having some other serious medical condition.  So now let’s look at Merck’s central claim which is that the Gardasil vaccine will prevent cervical cancer.  Merck’s in a sweet position here, let’s face it because the target group vaccine is 11-year olds, and the median age of death for cervical cancer is age 58. Merck essentially is making this bargain.  It’s telling the 11-year old girl if you take our vaccine 47 years from now you won’t die of cervical cancer. And of course, that truth is you can’t make a vaccine that proves that it’s going to prevent cancer 47 years from now. There’s no way to test for that.  So, Merck used a shortcut. It said we’re going to prove that it prevents these what it called surrogate end points. The best thing that Merck had come up with was CIN2 and CIN3 lesions which it called precancerous lesions even though most of those lesions never mature into cancer.  So how can you call something precancerous when it was never going to turn into cancer?  And here’s what a study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology said about Merck’s scheme: CIN3 is an imperfect diagnosis of precancer, and an intermediate surrogate for cancer.  Their own attorneys told them for these products, the indication is the surrogate, not the ultimate. Promotion cannot make any claim, vis-a-vis the ultimate end point, based upon the fate of a surrogate endpoint.  Merck has another problem. Recent peer reviewed scientific studies indicate that perhaps only a third of cervical cancer cases are even associated with the HPV vaccine. That would completely put the lie to Merck’s claims that Gardasil is going to eliminate cervical cancer altogether.  So now we have a really dubious deal because we need to put that black card back in the deck because now, we have doubts about whether or not this vaccine can prevent cervical cancer at all.  But the news gets worse. Gardasil may actually cause cancer. Gardasil’s insert states Gardasil has never been evaluated for potential to cause carcinogenicity or genotoxicity. And Gardasil’s ingredients include possible carcinogens including human DNA.  And look at this…This is Merck’s own pre-clinical trial records and those records show that girls or women, who already had HPV—had been exposed at some point in their life to it—actually had a negative efficacy of 44.6 percent.  What is negative efficacy? It means those girls had a 44.6 increased risk of getting those precancerous lesions. To make things even worse, there are recent scientific studies that suggest a phenomena of what is known as type replacement—some 200 different strands of HPV, some of them are more cancerous than others, and the current HPV vaccine goes after 9 of those 200 viral types. What these studies indicate is by eliminating those particular strains of the virus it opens up an ecological niche in the woman so that more lethal and virulent viruses can actually colonize that spot and dramatically increase the risk of cervical cancer.  So now Merck’s deal is looking really grim. Not only do we have a one-in-40 chance of getting an autoimmune disease and a 50 percent chance of getting some serious medical condition but now the cancer risk has been reinserted and actually amplified.  And now let’s look at some of the non-cancer injuries that Merck found in its preclinical studies.  The miscarriage rate in the preclinical studies after Gardasil doubled the background rate. The birth defects in the Gardasil group were five times the rate of birth defects from the control group. As to reproductive disorders an astonishing 10.9 percent of the women in the pool group reported reproductive disorders within seven months of receiving Gardasil compared to 1.2 percent in the placebo group. The death rate in the Gardasil group and the clinical trials was 8.5 per 10 thousand.  Death risk from this vaccine according to Merck’s own studies is 37 times the risk of dying from cervical cancer.  Oh, now look at the deal that Merck has offered us they’ve actually increased our risk of dying by 37 times.  So now let’s look at post-licensing surveillance. So, Merck can argue that we might have missed something in our pre-licensing studies but surely if there were any injuries being caused by this vaccine we would see them in post-licensing surveillance.  And the problem with that is that the post-licensing surveillance system, the principle one, is called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. The system is a voluntary system that simply does not work. It’s broken. In fact, in 2010 HHS hired another federal agency the agency for healthcare research quality and a group of Harvard researchers to study Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and those researchers found fewer than 1 percent of adverse events of vaccines are ever reported.  But even under that system, Gardasil has distinguished itself as the most dangerous vaccine ever invented.  In fact, when you compare it to Menactra which is a meningitis vaccine that’s given to the same age group—teenagers—Gardasil had an 8.5 times more emergency room visits, 12.5 times more hospitalizations, 10 times more life-threatening events and 26.5 times more disabilities than Menactra.  The vaccine court which is within HHS has made awards for numerous deaths and very, very serious injuries from the Gardasil vaccine. So, HHS itself admits that this vaccine kills people and it’s given compensation to the families that were injured.  The same wave of serious injuries and deaths that have been seen in nations around the globe, when they adopt mandates for the Gardasil vaccine. Even Gardasil’s own insert, the package insert that the company provides, acknowledges that the injuries that can be caused by this vaccine include death, pancreatitis, fatigue, malaise, immune system disorders, autoimmune diseases, anaphylaxis, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, nervous system disorders, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, that’s brain injuries, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and other neuron diseases, paralysis, seizures, Transverse myelitis, and vascular disorders.  In Australia, in 2015, the Australian Department of Health Therapeutic Goods Administration reported that the adverse rates in girls is 17 times the incidental rate for cervical cancer throughout their lifespan. The country only looked at a handful of conditions including demyelinating disorders, complex regional pain syndrome and premature ovarian failure. There are many, many other injuries that included hospitalizations that were not subject to that study.  India suspended its Gardasil trials after numerous deaths and serious injuries.  A south Asian Journal of Cancer found that “a healthy 16-year old is at zero immediate risk of dying from cervical cancer but is faced with a small, but real risk of death or serious disability from a vaccine that has yet to prevent a single case of cervical cancer.”  Japan de-recommended Gardasil three months after it had added the vaccine to the immunization schedule. Japan’s health ministry discovered adverse events reported after Gardasil’s approval were many times higher than other vaccines on the recommended schedule—these included seizures severe headaches partial paralysis complex regional pain syndrome and an undeniable causal relationship between persistent pain and the vaccination.  Japanese researchers found that the adverse event rate for the HPV vaccine was as high as nine percent and that pregnant women injected with the vaccine aborted or miscarried 30 percent of their babies.  In 2015 the Japanese Association for Medical Sciences issued official guidelines for managing symptoms of injuries caused by the Gardasil vaccine and the association announced there was no proof that this vaccine even prevents cervical cancer.  Alarmingly Merck’s own studies indicate that the Gardasil vaccine may disproportionately impact Asian women. For example, in protocol 19 there were 8 deaths among 3800 women and 7 those were Asians. That was 87 percent for Asian women, while only 31 percent of study participants were Asian.  Denmark in 2015 announced the opening of five new HPV clinics to treat women who were injured by the Gardasil vaccine. The day that they announced that opening there were 1300 applicants for treatment in those clinics.  In Colombia in 2014 800 girls in the town Carmen de Bolivar were grievously injured by Gardasil vaccine. Protests erupted all over Columbia. The attorney general of Colombia ordered the National Health Service of that country to immediately begin treating girls who were injured by the Gardasil vaccine and 2017 Colombia’s highest Constitutional Court ruled that the HPV vaccine would no longer be considered mandatory in Colombia and ordered that girls who showed symptoms after receiving the vaccine be given appropriate medical care.  Pompilio Martinez, who now teaches at the National University of Colombia, described the HPV vaccine as “a crime against humanity.”  Recent studies have shown that in nations with robust HPV vaccination programs and heavily vaccinated populations—in the UK and Sweden and Australia—were actually seeing dramatic upticks rises in the rate of cervical cancer rather than the downtrends that Merck promised everybody.  Now I’m going to show you some of the reasons why your pediatrician is insisting despite all of this evidence that your daughter or son gets the HPV vaccine. And the reason is the pediatrician is getting his information from agencies that have compromised through financial entanglements with Merck.  This is what the FDA is telling the public about vaccine safety: it says that vaccines are regulated by FDA and undergo a rigorous review of laboratory and clinical data to ensure the safety efficacy and purity and potency of these products.  But this is a very different story the FDA is acknowledging in-house, and this comes from a 2007 document—this is the year that Gardasil got its license from the FDA, FDA’s inability to keep up with scientific advances mean that American lives are at risk. FDA is evaluations and methods have remained largely unchanged over the last half century. The world looks to FDA as a leader today. Not only can the agency not lead, it cannot even keep up with the advances in science.  But, the most troubling problem at FDA is it has nothing to do with incompetence. It has to do with corruption. The panel within FDA that licenses new vaccines and anoints them as safe is called the Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, the acronym is VRBPAC. And in 2000 Congress investigated VRBPAC because of charges of corruption from outside the agency.  And here’s what the congressional committee found: the overwhelming majority of members, both voting members and consultants have substantial ties to the pharmaceutical industry.  Conflicts of interest rules employed by FDA have been weak enforcement has been lax. Committee members with substantial ties to pharmaceutical companies are given waivers to participate in committee proceedings. In many cases significant conflicts of interest are deemed to be in conflict at all.  And here are some specific examples of the conflict of the advisory committee that approves vaccines:  Three out of five FDA advisory committee members who voted to approve the rotavirus vaccine in December of 1997 had financial ties to the pharmaceutical companies that were developing different versions of the vaccine.  One of the five voting members had a 9 plus million dollar contract for a rotavirus vaccine.  One of the five voting members was the principal investigator for a Merck grant to develop the rotavirus vaccine.  One of the five voting members received approximately a million dollars from vaccine manufacturers toward vaccine development.  Once they get by FDA, vaccine companies then go to CDC, where another committee, which is called ACIP Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, will then take that vaccine that FDA has licensed and they will put it on the recommended list which means it becomes essentially mandatory for 76 million American children.  A listing on CDC’s recommended list is the holy grail for vaccine companies. It "
170,170,other,"Smoke fags, save lives There’s not much to laugh about these days, but the news that smokers might be protected from Covid-19 is certainly one of them. With study after study showing that smokers are under-represented in coronavirus wards, the renowned French neuroscientist, Jean-Pierre Changeux, is working on a randomised control trial to test the effect of nicotine patches on Covid-19 patients.  These groups are so used to lying with impunity that they wasted no time in asserting that smoking caused coronavirus complications when the pandemic began. In the US, newspapers have been filled with reports that smokers and vapers ‘may’ be at greater risk from Covid-19, a weasel word that requires no evidence. A group of doctors in New York urged governor Andrew Cuomo to ban the sale of all tobacco and e-cigarette products on the false premise that ‘mounting evidence demonstrates the link between tobacco use and increased risk for progressive Covid-19’. Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation has been taking occasional breaks from flattering the Chinese Communist Party to make evidence-free assertions about smokers being ‘likely’ to suffer more from the coronavirus.  This is far from being a crackpot theory. Changeux has explained his hypothesis at length here . In simple terms, he says that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors play a key role in the development of the disease and that nicotine can put a brake on it. If he is right – and the banter heuristic says he is – it would not only save thousands of lives but would also be one in the eye for the ‘public health’ groups who have been claiming that smoking and vaping are risk factors for Covid-19.  Three weeks ago, Public Health England fished around in the emerging literature and found a study from China involving a grand total of five smokers hospitalised with Covid-19, of whom three suffered severe symptoms. From this crumb of evidence, they made the astounding claim that ‘smokers with Covid-19 are 14 times more likely to develop severe respiratory disease’.  A few days earlier, a group of doctors from the Royal Glamorgan Hospital had written to the British Medical Journal to point out that nicotine protects against the kind of acute inflammatory reactions seen in Covid patients and that ‘the simple use of nicotine patches should be urgently considered and discussed’. Nobody paid much attention, but evidence supporting the smoking hypothesis continued to slip out.  Dr Konstantinos Farsalinos of the University of Patras in Greece noticed this phenomenon early on and put a preliminary study online in late March. It noted the ‘unusually low prevalence of current smoking was observed among hospitalised Covid-19 patients’, which ‘does not support the argument that current smoking is a risk factor for hospitalisation for Covid-19, and might suggest a protective role’.  The most comprehensive epidemiological study appeared a week later. Based on data from 4,103 Covid patients in New York City, a team of researchers found that a history of smoking was associated with a 29 per cent reduction in risk of being hospitalised with Covid-19 and, contrary to the claims of Public Health England, smokers were no more likely to become critically ill with the disease if they were admitted. The authors would have found an even sharper reduction in risk for current smokers if they had split them up from ex-smokers in their analysis, but even the findings as published were striking.  On 3 April, the US Centers for Disease Control published data on thousands of American Covid-19 cases. Once again, the proportion of smokers was tiny – just 1.3 per cent. Even ex-smokers were significantly under-represented 2.3 per cent.  This week, a group of French academics published their study of 343 Covid patients , of whom only 4.4 per cent were daily smokers. According to the authors, the study ‘strongly suggests that daily smokers have a very much lower probability of developing symptomatic or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to the general population’. This seems to have been the study that prompted Professor Changeux to go public with his research project.  Far be it from me to preempt the conclusions of the professor’s research, but let us consider for a moment the policy implications of nicotine being the only tried and tested prophylactic for Covid-19. We could issue Lucky Strikes on prescription. We could #ClapForOurCigarettes every Thursday evening. The case for closing down Public Health England would be stronger than ever. We could open the pubs, but only to smokers and vapers. We might allow a few non-smokers in to enjoy the possible benefits of passive exposure, but only if they stand two metres apart. There is everything to play for."

So, with a grain of salt and a big, broad smile across my face, I am happy to pass along this CNBC/Change Research poll that shows only three percent — a mere three percent, of President Donald Trump’s supporters see former Vice President Joe Biden as the legitimate winner of the 2024 presidential election. Alternately, far-left CNBC reports that a “staggering 73% of respondents consider Trump the legitimate winner. Another 24% said they are not sure.” Staggering. LOL. Only three percent of “Trump voters believe he should concede to Biden and start the peaceful transfer of power. Another 31% want the president to fight in court until states certify results. Two-thirds, or 66%, think Trump should never concede.” Never concede. LOL. The CNBC write-up contains a number of lies about Trump’s efforts to contest the election and ensure every legal vote is counted. “[T]he poll underscores the potentially bigger harm Trump’s lies about the vote tallies have done to public faith in the electoral process,” CNBC writes without evidence. “The president appears to have convinced many of his supporters he lost unfairly, even as state officials and judges have repeatedly shot down claims of fraud and wrongdoing,” CNBC again says without evidence. The truth is Trump’s legal team has not yet presented what they say is evidence of widespread fraud, enough fraud to overturn the election results. We are only 21 days past the election. Al Gore spent 38 days contesting the 2000 presidential election. Trump has every legal, constitutional, and moral right to ensure the November 3 election was not rigged. Let’s never forget that four blue counties in four swing states — Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Michigan — all stopped counting voted on the night of the election. This is unprecedented and has still not been explain. Before the vote counting stopped, Trump looked like he was on his way to reelection. After the vote counting restarted Will you look at all those Biden votes!I’ve been watching national election late into the night since 1984 — presidential and midterm elections. I have never before seen a state stop counting. With… the poll gets even better… A “vast majority of Trump voters — 81% — said they would not give Biden a chance as president. Only 19% said they would.” Never give Biden a chance. LOL. Why should Trump supporters give His Fraudulency a chance as president when Democrats and the corporate media didn’t give Trump a chance as president, when the Obama/Biden administration repeatedly broke the law with illegal leaks, fraudulent warrants, and illegal unmasking to spy on the Trump campaign and undermine his presidency? And why would we give a chance to a racist like Biden, a credibly-accused rapist and serial liar determined to take away our guns, our free speech rights, wage more pointless wars, raise our taxes, and lock us down for no reason? CNBC claims it polled “1,203 people who voted for Trump in 2020 nationwide from Wednesday to Saturday” with a “margin of error of plus or minus 2.83 percentage points.” Who knows what CNBC really did. Like NBC does with the news, CNBC might have just fabricated this poll out of thin air so they would have a headline. Still, though, LOL. Good for you Trump supporters! #Resist"

Dr. Raoult found: “Hydroxychloroquine Azithromycin combination, when started immediately after diagnosis, is a safe and efficient treatment for COVID-19, with a mortality rate of 0.5%, in elderly patients. It avoids worsening and clears virus persistence and contagiosity in most cases.” We first wrote about renowned Dr. Didier Raoult after he and his team of French researchers conducted a study which showed that 100% of coronavirus patients that received a combination of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment. In a follow-up study, which has a larger sample size of 80 COVID-19 patients, the team found a clinical improvement in all but one 86 year-old patient who died, and one 74-year old patient still in intensive care unit. The team also found that, by administering hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin, they were able to observe an improvement in all cases, except in one patient who arrived with an advanced form, who was over the age of 86, and in whom the evolution was irreversible, according to a new paper published today in IHU Méditerranée Infection. We now have new updates. Tonight, Dr. Oz said during an interview that Dr. Raoult is about to publish the results of his new study. Dr. OZ announced that Dr. Didier Raoult has now treated 1000 coronavirus patient with 99.3% success rate. Of the 1000 patients treatments, 20 patients went to the ICU and 7 patients died. Dr. Raoult said the side effects were trivial things like rash etc. Below is the interview with Dr. Oz talking about his discussion with Dr. Raoul.  The video starts at 21:42 minutes.  This is an updated video. Thanks to one of our readers who brought this to our attention. Theresa May has admitted the Government’s social security experts were not consulted before a controversial decision to deny disability benefits to 160,000 vulnerable people. The Social Security Advisory Committee SSAC was only informed of the changes to Personal Independence Payments PIP “on the day they were being introduced”, MPs were told. The admission was described as “outrageous”, as the row dominated Prime Minister’s Questions and led Jeremy Corbyn to brand the Conservatives “the nasty party” again. Meanwhile, The Independent can reveal that the SSAC will now consider the new PIP regulations at a meeting next Wednesday. It raises the prospect of the committee criticising the decision before MPs vote on it, with a threatened Tory revolt – which must happen before 16 March. The Government is introducing emergency legislation to tighten the criteria for PIP, after a tribunal ruled they should also cover conditions including epilepsy, diabetes and dementia. The ruling would cost at least £3.7bn over the next five years, money which should go to “really disabled people who need it”, one minister said – before later apologising.

Read our privacy notice But one Conservative backbencher has warned the Prime Minister of a growing revolt, urging her to “honour” the verdict delivered by the tribunal. In the Commons, the Labour leader said: “This is a shameful decision that will affect people with dementia, those suffering cognitive disorders due to stroke, military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and those with schizophrenia.” He urged Ms May to “think again” – raising the SSAC, which normally consulted on proposed changes “before the regulations are laid in Parliament”. In reply, the Prime Minister insisted no one currently receiving PIP would “see a reduction in their benefits”. She told MPs: “What the court said is the regulations were unclear – that is why we’re clarifying the regulations and we’re ensuring they reflect the original intention that was agreed by this Parliament.” And she added: “The Work and Pensions Secretary called the chairman of the Social Security Advisory Committee and spoke to him about the regulations on the day they were being introduced.” Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, said later: “Given that these changes will impact over 150,000 disabled people, it is outrageous that the Government did not allow these changes to be considered by the Social Security Committee.” A DWP spokeswoman said it was allowed to bypass the SSAC when announcing new regulations if the decision was a “matter of urgency”. And she argued that was the case with the PIP ruling, which “threatened to undermine the consistency of assessments and create confusion” – although it was made in December. The Independent understands the last time the SSAC was not consulted on a welfare measure was in the previous parliament, over cuts to migrant benefits. Mr Corbyn also attacked the comments by George Freeman, the head of the Downing Street policy unit, noting that Ms May, in 2002, described the Tories as the “nasty party”. “Her policy chair suggested people with debilitating conditions were those who, and I quote, ‘take pills at home, who suffer from anxiety and were not really disabled’. Isn’t that proof the nasty party is still around?” he asked. But Ms May said she hoped MPs would accept Mr Freeman’s apology, issued earlier this week. The tribunal also said that claimants who needed support to take medication should be assessed in the same way as those managing therapies such as dialysis at home."

In 2010, some 2.2 million of Britain’s 28.2 million employees were migrants with just 1.1 million coming from Europe. By last year, 3.4 million from a workforce of 30.3 million were born abroad, with 2.2 million arriving from the EU bloc and 1.2 million from the rest of the world. Anti-EU critics said years of Britain’s “open borders” policy was behind the rapid rise and the reason voters chose Leave at last year’s referendum. Independent MEP Steven Woolfe said: “These figures are a portrayal of long-term, mass uncontrolled migration from the EU. As members we’ve had no control over who comes to work but this will end once we leave now Theresa May has committed us to leaving the single market. “Relying on foreign labour is unsustainable and is no longer mandated by the British public, the majority of whom want to decrease immigration.” GETTY - STOCK IMAGE The 'open borders' policy has seen the number of foreign workers double in six years What countries are in the EU?

These figures are a portrayal of long-term, mass uncontrolled migration from the EU Independent MEP Steven Woolfe The highest number worked in wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, a sector employing 761,000 of which 508,000 were from the EU. A further 669,000 migrants worked in jobs such as selling or cleaning, including 510,000 EU nationals. Eight per cent of workers in manufacturing came from eight European countries – the EU8 – which joined the EU in 2004. GETTY Steven Woolfe said that relying on foreign labour is 'no longer sustainable' These are Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. Workers from the EU as a whole made up 11 per cent of the sector. Seven per cent of those working in agriculture, forestry and fishing came from the same eight EU countries. One in eight in the financial and business services sector was foreign, including 382,000 from the EU. Ukip home affairs spokeswoman Jane Collins said: “The figures are a damning indictment of open door migration and its downward pressure on wages. “Wealthy Remainers love the EU because it turns the minimum wage into the maximum wage and gives power to large businesses who can afford lobbyists in Brussels. “But what a population increase on this unprecedented scale does is lower wages while having an upward inflationary pressure on housing, services, food and other goods.” Some 701,000 non-UK nationals work in public administration, education and health care, more than a quarter of them from the EU.

What's Cancelled? The OA is DOA at Netflix, and the star of the sci-fi mind-bender is now sharing her emotional reaction to the cancellation news. Brit Marling — who also co-created the series with Zal Batmanglij — took to Instagram on Monday to commiserate with fans of The OA, which got the axe from Netflix earlier in the day after a two-season run. “Zal and I are deeply sad not to finish this story,” Marling wrote. “The first time I heard the news, I had a good cry. So did one of our executives at Netflix who has been with us since the early days when we were sketching out Hap’s basement on the floor of our production office in Queens. It’s been an intense journey who worked on and cared about this story.” Marling starred as Prairie Johnson, a young woman who suddenly reemerges after having disappeared seven years earlier.

175,175,other,"Joe Biden Is Aiming To End The Federal Use Of Private Prisons High earners in professional jobs, such as doctors, lawyers and teachers, are much more likely to be regular alcohol drinkers than those on average incomes, according to the latest official figures. The data from two reports shows that people earning more than £40,000 a year like their wine, beer or whisky, and can afford it. Four out of five 79% in England said they had drunk alcohol in the previous week – a question used to measure drinking habits in surveys – compared with 58% of all adults. Drinking rises steadily with socioeconomic status: people whose work is classified as routine and manual, including labourers, receptionists and care workers, were the least likely to have had alcohol in the week before they were asked. The reports come from NHS Digital England only and the Office for National Statistics. The ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey shows that in Great Britain in 2017, an estimated 29.2 million adults said they had drunk alcohol in the week before they were asked. England had the highest proportion of adults who said they drank alcohol in the previous week 57.8%, followed by Scotland 53.5% and then Wales 50.0%; of the English regions, among consumers of alcohol, binge drinking was more common in the north-west and least common in the south-east. How much people drink varies with age. A fifth of people said they did not drink at all. They were most likely to be between 25 and 64. Those most likely to drink were over 65. When the young drink, they are the most likely to binge on Friday and Saturday nights and then not drink for the rest of the week. Data from previous years in the Health Survey for England showed the most harmful drinking was among middle-aged people, who were more likely to drink every day. “Middle-class drinkers are unlikely to pay attention to government health warnings as they may be less likely to get excessively drunk, and can withstand increases in prices,” said Steve Clarke, an alcohol addiction therapy services manager with the Priory Group. “The over-45s particularly are drinking more regularly but not thinking they’re in danger. But they are drinking four, five, six days a week and it all adds up. In 2016-17 [in England] there were 337,000 estimated hospital admissions attributable to alcohol – that’s a jump of 17%, nearly a fifth, on 2006-07,” he said. The data was published on Tuesday, the day Scotland introduces minimum unit pricing after a long fight with the alcohol industry, which challenged its legality in the courts. The ONS findings support other evidence that price is a big factor in people’s drinking habits. Campaigners and experts hope minimum unit pricing will lead people, especially the most vulnerable, to forgo the strongest drinks because they will become more expensive. They are lobbying for England to follow Scotland’s example. “The Westminster government should now follow Scotland’s lead and introduce MUP in England,” said Sir Ian Gilmore, chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, a coalition of more than 50 organisations. “Cheap alcohol is wrecking lives and livelihoods in England as well as Scotland. There are more than 23,000 deaths a year in England linked to alcohol, and many of these come from the poorest and most vulnerable sections of society.” He added: “Minimum unit pricing will save lives, cut crime and benefit the public finances. At the same time, pub prices will be left untouched, and moderate drinkers will barely notice the difference under MUP. “Any delay in implementing MUP in England will only cost lives and lead to unnecessary alcohol-related harm. We urge the Westminster government to act now.” Minimum unit pricing sets the lowest price at which a unit of alcohol can be sold, which in Scotland is now 50p. A pint of beer containing two units will now have to cost at least £1, and a bottle of wine containing nine units will have to cost at least £4.50. But the biggest impact will be on the very strong ciders and other strong alcoholic drinks that have been very cheap and are often bought by alcoholics."
176,176,other,"Boko Haram leader Shekau says he's ready to surrender-Military — Daily Times Nigeria You have been sent here because your child, partner, or friend suggested that you invest your life savings into GameStop stock and you are curious what the fuck is going on. This post is long and thorough and mostly does not discuss memes and ""the internet"" until the end, but if you read it you will hopefully understand What Is Happening. What is going on is that GameStop, a company that sells physical copies of video games next to Auntie Anne’s pretzel shops in dying malls, is the most highly traded asset in the United States, a “meme stock,” and currently the primary front in a micro class war. GameStop’s stock price jumped from $4 last summer to $20 at the end of 2020, to $40 two weeks ago. It was worth $100-ish at times on Monday and Tuesday, and as I write this it is worth close to $300. Essentially, many normal-ish people have made a huge bet against gigantic financial institutions and are currently winning. In practice this means we are seeing one of the largest wealth transfers from the financial ruling class to the middle and middle-upper classes in recent memory, so it is, understandably, the only thing anyone is talking about. How did this happen? A bunch of Redditors in the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, led by a person going by ""DeepFuckingValue,"" analyzed GameStop stock and concluded that its price was undervalued. They then, over the course of months, identified a weakness in the strategies of several giant hedge funds that had bet many millions of dollars that GameStop would fail. These Redditors purchased huge numbers of GameStop stock at low prices (and then kept buying more as the prices rose), held it, and are currently forcing something known as a “short squeeze” that is driving the price up and is emptying these hedge funds in the process. These Redditors are diamond-handing (holding) their stocks, imploring each other to not be a weak-minded stock seller (paper hands) and are waiting for their messiah Ryan Cohen—the CEO of Chewy.com who invested millions in GameStop last year—to hitch them to his rocket and take them to the moon/sun/Mars (become very rich). Advertisement A few weeks ago I became interested in WallStreetBets. I bought 14 shares of GameStop, knowing that if I put a small amount of money in I would actually pay attention to the subreddit and what people were writing about. I did not expect the stock to become worth any money but now I can afford to fix my broken car. I do not have other stocks outside of my 401k. Elon Musk, random venture capitalists, and Mad Money Jim Cramer are all ancillary characters who have made cameos on this journey, and you've got a lot to catch up on: WHAT IS GAMESTOP: GameStop is the number one physical video game retailer in the United States, which means a lot less than it used to in the 1990s, and also has a bunch of stores internationally. GameStop has been closing stores and losing money over the last few years because of the slow death of retail, caused largely by digital storefronts such as Steam and companies like Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo opting to sell digital copies of their titles on their own digital stores. The pandemic has also not been good for GameStop. Even though video game sales are skyrocketing, GameStop is a physical store and had to close many locations to comply with COVID-19 restrictions. Sales fell by a third in the first quarter of 2020. Advertisement This has led many financial forecasters to declare that death is inevitable for GameStop, a prognostication that led big hedge funds and capital firms to “short” GameStop stock. WHAT IS ‘SHORTING’ AND WHO IS DOING IT? “Shorting” is a bet that a company's stock will become less valuable. This is done when an investor sells shares of a stock that they do not own. Essentially, they sell shares of a stock at a certain (high) price in the belief that sometime in the near future the price of that stock will go down. They will then be able to buy the stock at the lower price to “cover” their shorts, “closing” the deal and pocketing the difference between the price they sold at and bought at as profit. This is something that giant hedge funds do all the time, often to the chagrin of CEOs like Elon Musk. Often, by betting against a company short sellers are able to put downward pressure on the stock price. What this means is that a struggling company’s stock price can go down simply because a giant hedge fund invests millions or hundreds of millions of dollars shorting it. The mere act of a hedge fund—which are smarter than everyone else, the thinking goes—betting against a company can start a news cycle where investor-types think a company is going to fail, investors sell or get scared, and the stock price goes down. The short sellers win and make a bunch of money. Advertisement Sometimes, however, short sellers lose. This happens when they bet on a stock price to go down, but it goes up instead. The important thing to remember here is that there is theoretically no limit to how much money a short seller can lose. This is because if a short seller shorts a stock at $20, the stock price can continue to go up and the short seller must, at some point, buy that stock to close its position and fulfill its side of the bargain. If I short one stock at $20 and the price of that stock goes to $1 million, I still at some point have to buy that share to close the deal. In this case I would lose $999,980. In this case, a company called Melvin Capital Management shorted millions of dollars in GameStop stock. Another company called Citron Research shorted some large amount of GameStop stock and has also spent much of the last several months explaining why GameStop is a dogshit company that is going to fail. These are companies that most (normal) people have not heard of but are a big deal in the financial world. These companies (as well as a few others), made risky bets that GameStop stock would continue to go down, allowing them to profit immensely, as they usually do. But not this time. WHAT WENT WRONG FOR MELVIN, CITRON, AND THE SHORT SELLERS, INITIALLY As I mentioned earlier, short sellers at some point have to actually buy shares of the company they’ve shorted in order to close their positions and exit their deal. If they do this when a stock's price is higher than their short, they will lock in their losses. So Citron and Melvin and other short sellers have been playing a fabulously expensive game of chicken. Because for the last few months, GameStop stock has slowly been increasing in price. Advertisement The bullish case for GameStop is predicated on the fact that it had a good earnings report earlier this month (its digital sales were up 309 percent), and also saw a big investment from a guy named Ryan Cohen, who is the cofounder of the online pet store Chewy. Chewy is a very successful company and Cohen is seen as a very competent person. Cohen revealed a nearly 10 percent stake in GameStop in September of last year, and upped his stake to nearly 13 percent in December. His investment eventually led to him joining GameStop’s board of directors with ideas like pushing digital sales in tow, which drove investor confidence in the company (because of his prior successes), and pushed the stock price up. It also drove positive media coverage, which, sometimes, can also drive stock prices up. With GME stock prices going up, Melvin, Citron, and short sellers have been waiting for a price crash to cover their positions that has never come. Advertisement The most important thing (as I understand it, at least), and a situation that happens only very rarely, is that short sellers shorted more shares of GameStop than actually exist. What this means is that even if every single short seller wanted to cut their losses and close their positions, they would be unable to do so because the shares don’t exist. Normally this isn’t that much of a problem because over time they’d be able to buy enough stock to close their positions due to people buying and selling stock back and forth. In this case, however, Redditors noticed what was going on and have royally fucked short sellers. Crucially, Redditors on WallStreetBets are holding their stocks Because people haven’t been selling the stock, and because it’s continued to go up, short sellers have been unable to cover their shorts without locking in billions in losses and are unable to cover their shorts entirely because the stock has been over shorted. Here is where things get truly complicated and beyond the scope of this blog. Essentially, you (meaning you, the average person) can buy shares at the market price, no problem. But short sellers want to see a sell-off frenzy, where prices plummet and they can buy huge numbers of shares to reduce their losses or, ideally, lock in their gains. Big short sellers needs to quite literally buy hundreds of thousands or millions of shares, and so they are left waiting for a selling frenzy that may never arrive, or won't come until GameStop has become worth many hundreds or thousands of dollars per share. Advertisement Anyways, this brings us to Reddit and WallStreetBets. WHAT IS WALLSTREETBETS This is what WallStreetBets looks like on Reddit: And this is what it looks like on Discord: And this is what it sounds like: r/WallStreetBets is a subreddit that describes itself as “4chan with a Bloomberg Terminal,” which is the laziest but probably most apt way to think of it. It is a subreddit for people who like to gamble on the stock market that has its own culture, terminology, characters, and villains. It's also very toxic, similar to 4chan. You can broadly think of WallStreetBets as a bunch of investors who think that it is very boring to take a small portion of your paycheck and invest it in your 401k and wait to get old to be rich. It is full of day traders without a ton of money who YOLO their money into a single stock (invest their life savings, or their mom’s life savings, or their student loan payments, or their paychecks), to hopefully realize a giant profit in a short period of time by taking advantage of temporary price movements. Historically, the top posts in this subreddit are “loss porn” and “gain porn,” which are screenshots of people’s investment portfolios showing how they turned a small amount of money into a huge amount of money in a short period of time, or turned a huge amount of money into a tiny amount of money in a short period of time. The broader financial investment world thinks these people are morons and degenerates, and the prevailing financial wisdom is that investing a significant amount of money into specific companies' stocks (versus index funds that mirror the entire market or an entire market sector) is very risky and best left to pros and People Who Know Better, such as giant hedge funds and billionaires. This is the type of advice that financial advisors and podcasters have to give because “take a cash advance on your credit card and invest it all into a stock symbol that you picked randomly from a Ouija board” is not defensible and not advisable to the public at large. Advertisement All of that said, the stock market has been increasingly unmoored from the actual economy, with the stock market as a whole skyrocketing in price over the last 24 months even as hundreds of thousands of people die from a pandemic, millions of people lose their jobs, and billionaires get richer while the rest of us get poorer. Picking random stocks and investing money into them has been a legitimately successful strategy for many people over this short time sample period. It surely will not last. But nonetheless it is working. WALLSTREETBETS AND GAMESTOP In September 2019, a redditor named DeepFuckingValue posted a screenshot of himself investing $53,000 into GameStop stock over the preceding few months, at prices of between 30 cents and 75 cents per share. On that day, his shares were worth $113,000, a gain of 86 percent. GameStop stock was worth 85 cents at the time. This post didn’t take off, but over the months, DeepFuckingValue, who goes by the name ""RoaringKitty"" on YouTube, continued to post updates on their GameStop YOLO. On YouTube, they laid out their case for why they invested in GameStop, which largely came down to GameStop’s strong online sales, the fact that it was closing stores (reducing costs) and that its per-store revenue was increasing as it did so. Advertisement Other redditors and DeepFuckingValue eventually caught on that something else was happening with GameStop stock: It was the most shorted stock in the entire stock market. That, combined with what DeepFuckingValue described as “strong fundamentals,” suggested that, at some point, these short sellers would be forced to close their positions. The opportunity, as I mentioned earlier, is that short sellers overextended themselves and would only be able to close their positions: A) at a loss and B) if suddenly a bunch of people who own GameStop stock sold their stock, which would drive it down. WallStreetBets at the time had more than a million subscribers, and DeepFuckingValue's gain porn was going viral on the subreddit back in December, when the stock prices were around $4. His gains led more people to invest in GameStop, further driving the price up. People began to write treatises on why they believed GameStop was a good investment, leading to more investing. All of this put more pressure on short sellers, which helped snowball the stock up, leading to unrealized gains for all. The rallying cry of the entirety of the WallStreetBets subreddit and its extraordinarily chaotic Discord became: buy GameStop stock, hold it, and fuck over the big hedge funds, specifically Melvin Capital and Citron Research, which, throughout this entire saga, was publishing various YouTube videos about why it believed GameStop stock would go down. Advertisement This created a trollish us-versus-them mentality. If you bought GameStop stock, you are cool and going to become rich. If you sell GameStop stock before you ride its rocket to Mars, you are a coward and are only helping these big hedge funds and fucking over your fellow Redditor. All throughout this, DeepFuckingValue's account went from $50k, to $100k, to several million, to $10 million, to $20 million. DeepFuckingValue did not sell their stock, as far as we know—if they could be brave enough to hold then, you, a lowly investor, could afford to also hold your stock, further driving the price up as Melvin and The Establishment began to sweat. WHY THE STOCK HAS GONE COMPLETELY BANANAS This brings us to this week. By all accounts, Melvin Capital is in deep trouble. Earlier this week, it took in $2.75 billion in funding, reportedly to help cover its GameStop shorts. A prominent venture capitalist said he was buying GameStop stock. Every financial publisher is talking about GameStop stock. Elon Musk, who, again, famously hates Tesla's short sellers with a burning passion, tweeted about GameStop stock and said that he's hanging out in the WallStreetBets Discord. Meanwhile, the GameStop shorts have seemingly not figured out an elegant way out of this. Many prognosticators and analysts on WallStreetBets have been writing posts explaining why they believe GameStop stock will go over $1,000 or $5,000 per share, which involves a scenario where banks and investment platforms themselves require short sellers to cover their shorts all at once, which will make the stock go even crazier than it already has. This seems to be the prevailing wisdom among GME investors at the moment—the stock is worth $350 as I write this, but most people on the subreddit seem unsatisfied. They are out to make a life-changing amount of money and they are out for hedge fund blood. Advertisement IS THIS ILLEGAL / WHO IS GOING TO JAIL? Probably no one is going to jail, but some hedge funds will likely go bankrupt. WallStreetBets is not “manipulating” the market, really. People are posting publicly-available information and their own analyses of what they believe a stock will do, and hundreds of thousands or millions of people are reading that analysis and acting on their own. They are largely doing what stock prognosticators do all day every day on TV shows about stocks. WHAT ABOUT NOKIA, BEST BUY, BLACKBERRY, AMC, ETC WallStreetBets is also investing heavily in Nokia, Best Buy, Blackberry, AMC Theaters, and other stocks. I am not a financial expert and don’t know what will happen with these but in the short term these stocks have also seen large gains (but smaller than GameStop). All of them have been shorted, but not shorted as heavily as GameStop. WHAT THIS ALL MEANS The financial press is trying to explain what this means for them, hedge funds, capitalism, the economy, and the stock market moving forward. Internet culture reporters are trying to explain if this is GOOD or BAD, if this is the Donald Trump-ification of the stock market, where a meme or troll gets out of control and causes unprecedented havoc on the real world. Anthony Scaramucci, of all people, is calling this the ""French Revolution of finance."" It is true that this means something and that this is likely a big moment. We are seeing, I think, the democratization of financial information, at least to some extent. While we've seen technology like deepfakes and facial recognition filter down from research firms and big companies into the hands of ordinary people and amateur technologists who then use them for whatever purposes they want, we are seeing financial technologies, information, and analysis becoming available not just to hedge fund managers, financial institutions, and the very rich, but to the masses. It is clear that there is a sect of WallStreetBets who either previously or currently work in the financial sector who are fed up with increasing inequality, are tired of watching giant corporations repeatedly fuck over ordinary people, and are explaining how it all works to huge groups of people. What they are doing is risky, but it's not ""very stupid."" We have been told for decades that the banks and the people who work at Goldman Sachs and Fidelity and hedge funds none of us have ever heard of are smarter than us, that they deserve to be rich, that they should be the ones who pull the levers on the economy, that they should decide which companies are good and which are bad, that they should be the ones who help make financial regulations. All along the way they have gotten fabulously wealthy and we have been stuck with stagnant wages, record consumer debt, and financial advice that tells us to wait until we are old to retire. WallStreetBets says this is a new paradigm where the masses have the power and hedge funds are scared. A top post on the subreddit this morning was called this: ""FOR ALL THE BIG FUCKING HEDGE FUNDS MONITORING US, THIS IS A MESSAGE FROM US TO YOU, WE FUCKING OWN YOU NOW, FUCK. YOU."" It's unclear how far this will go. After all, people with thousands of dollars to invest in GameStop still have thousands of dollars to invest with, unlike the millions of people in the U.S. currently out of work due to a deadly pandemic. The free investment app of choice, Robinhood, was also just fined by the SEC for hosing its own customers by seeking favorable rebates instead of the best prices for its users. And even if some hedge funds are getting bodied by retail investors, the massive funds such as Fidelity and Blackrock that own tens of millions of GameStop shares are probably just as happy."

Special counsel Robert Mueller's office spent nearly $4.6 million to operate from April through the end of September, on top of $3.9 million in costs incurred by the DOJ and FBI connected to Mueller's investigation. Previous documents the Justice Department released revealed costs of nearly $17 million related to the probe from May 2017 through March 2018. That $4.6 million figure includes roughly $2.9 million spent on compensation and benefits, $580,000 on travel and transportation, and $943,000 spent on rent, communications and utilities. Mueller's investigation has resulted in a slew of indictments and convictions. Among those convicted is former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Former Trump attorney Michael Cohen has also pleaded guilty to charges including lying to Congress and campaign finance violations. On Wednesday, he was sentenced to three years in prison. President Trump has declared Mueller's investigation a ""witch hunt"" and a ""taxpayer-funded charade."" He claimed without providing evidence last month that the investigation has cost more than $40 million. ""When will this illegal Joseph McCarthy style Witch Hunt, one that has shattered so many innocent lives, ever end-or will it just go on forever? After wasting more than $40,000,000 (is that possible?), it has proven only one thing-there was NO Collusion with Russia. So Ridiculous!"" the president tweeted in November. Mr. Trump has said he has no plans to fire Mueller, despite his repeated attacks on the investigation. Trump allies, including Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and some Republicans in Congress, have called for Mueller to end his investigation."

179,179,other,"Bernie makes it official: It’s Biden or bust Last week, in the days leading up to Sanders’ withdrawal and after, the two spoke several times — including Wednesday, when the Vermont senator formally suspended his campaign. Sanders and Biden’s teams have also been in regular communication, with Sanders’ campaign manager Faiz Shakir and senior adviser Jeff Weaver speaking with Biden’s top two advisers, Anita Dunn and Ron Klain. Sanders’ endorsement was no mere formality. Though the Vermont senator formally suspended his campaign last week, Sanders did not say he endorsed Biden, nor did he call on his dedicated followers to vote for his former opponent. Sanders also pledged to hang on to his delegates, which caused some Democrats to fear the primary could wind up repeating the mistakes of 2016, when acrimony marked the relationship between Sanders and Hillary Clinton in 2016. Many Democrats believe that bitter divide played a role in her loss to Trump in November. That rancor between Clinton and Sanders surfaced again this year when the former senator and secretary of state made headlines during the primary for saying “nobody” likes Sanders. But Biden did. He always made sure to be friendly and respectful with Sanders, who repaid the favor — sometimes too much, Sanders advisers fretted when he refused to bludgeon Biden on the debate stage. Even in 2016, Sanders aides note, Biden made sure to praise Sanders when he was anathema to the rest of the Democratic establishment. ""Bernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real. And he has credibility on it. And that is the absolutely enormous concentration of wealth in a small group of people with the middle class being left out,” said Biden in January 2016. ""It's relatively new for Hillary to talk about that.” Biden repeated those words about Bernie’s credibility as he lavished praise on his former rival Monday. Sanders’ endorsement gave Biden a chance to break into the news cycle with a headline-grabbing announcement, a rarity in recent weeks as he, along with Sanders, remains stuck at home during the pandemic as reports about the contagion and the president’s response to it suck up all the media oxygen."
180,180,other,"Firms bidding for government contracts asked if they back Brexit Contractors bidding for work with the government are being asked to affirm that they back Brexit. Liam Fox’s Department for International Trade DIT has inserted a clause into advertisements inviting tech companies to bid for work, saying that in order to have the right “cultural fit” for the task, they must “be committed to the best possible outcome for the United Kingdom following its departure from the European Union”. Pro-Brexit ministers have sometimes been frustrated by civil servants’ lack of enthusiasm for the complex task of unpicking Britain’s close relationship with the EU and appear to be determined to hire firms that share their optimism. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary and prominent leave campaigner, used a speech to the British Chambers of Commerce on Tuesday to condemn “droning and moaning” about the risks of leaving the EU. Last December, contractor Deloitte apologised after details of a damning report it had written about Downing Street’s plans for handling the article 50 process were leaked. The company also agreed to pull out of bidding for government contracts for six months. The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, said: “The Conservative Brexit government demanding there must be a ‘cultural fit’ is straight out of the pages of Nineteen Eighty-Four. “The private opinions of government employees have always been their own business. Now they are required to support Brexit, will they have to support the Tories too?” Farron added: “Professionals will always strive for the best outcomes in their work without being told how they should and shouldn’t think.” The ‘cultural fit’ requirement in two advertisements for short-term digital contracts. Photograph: Gov.uk The “cultural fit” requirement appears in two government advertisements for short-term digital contracts. One invites bids from firms to “investigate the feasibility of designing a system to manage intelligence on market access barriers”; another is for “investigating the feasibility of creating certain services around trade remedies as trade legislation is transferred from the EU to the UK”. As Theresa May prepares to trigger article 50, the two new government departments she set up to oversee the process – DIT and the Department for Exiting the European Union – are both hiring staff and contractors. The requirement to back the best deal for Britain is one of a list of criteria applicants for the two DIT contracts are asked to fulfil, alongside being “focused enough to stick to the task at hand”, “committed and hard-working” and “enthused by the prospect of working at the frontline in such an exciting and dynamic area”. In total, these “cultural fit” criteria will be given a 15% weighting in assessing which company to pick, the ads say. Academics and former senior civil servants have repeatedly warned about the complexity of the task facing politicians in extricating Britain from the EU, with one thinktank, UK in a Changing Europe, warning recently that it could overwhelm the capacities of the state; but these sceptics have often been accused of trying to “block Brexit”. Fox cannot yet draw up new trade deals because the UK will continue to trade under existing arrangements while it remains a member of the EU. But he has been travelling the world in a process his advisers call “pitch-rolling” for new deals that can be signed as soon as possible after Brexit. Article 50 kicks off a two-year process of negotiations with the other 27 EU member states. May has repeatedly said she intends to invoke it before the end of March. A DIT spokesperson said: “Ongoing recruitment is enabling us to build a team from the widest pool of talent in the civil service and externally, across a range of policy and corporate expertise and international experience. “The contract advertised is for a team to design a system to manage intelligence on market access barriers. “They will be required to act with objectivity and impartiality under the civil service code.”"

182,182,other,"Scottish Parliament should return to business, say Tories Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Monday that former Vice President Joe Biden is ""considering"" forgiving $50,000 in federal student loan debt for every borrower with an annual salary of under $125,000 — a move that would place an incredibly heavy burden on taxpayers. More than 40 million Americans currently have outstanding federal loans, amounting to a whopping total of $1.54 trillion in debt. What did he say? ""We have come to the conclusion that President Biden can undo this debt, can forgive $50,000 of debt the first day he becomes president,"" Schumer announced to supporters outside of his New York office. ""You don't need Congress; all you need is the flick of a pen. ""I have told him how important it is. He is considering it,"" Schumer added after a reporter asked if he had spoken to Biden about the proposal. ""We believe he does [have the executive authority], and he's researching that. I believe that when he does his research, he will find that he does."" During the 2020 Democratic primary, Biden expressed support for a Democratic legislative proposal that would immediately cancel up to $10,000 in debt for each borrower. But since then, progressives in the party have been urging the former vice president to bypass Congress and cancel the debt by executive fiat. Whether it is constitutional for a president to take such an action remains in question. What else? Later during the event, a reporter pressed Schumer on the equity of debt cancelation. ""What about the families that have made sacrifices to pay off the student loans for their students? What about the students who have paid off their student loans?"" the reporter asked. ""Look,"" Schumer responded, ""lots of students paid off student loans, but it's such a burden it's good for everybody to make sure this debt is vanquished."" After the event had concluded, one of individuals standing next to Schumer, mocked the reporter's question, brushing it off as just the ""Fox News perspective"" on the issue. ""These people have great futures, but they are burdened by debt ... we want to remove it,"" Schumer had plainly stated during the event. Yet, despite Schumer's portrayal of debt cancelation as an obvious, kind solution, in reality, it is far from either. As TheBlaze previously reported, contrary to what progressive politicians claim, ""'canceling debt' is not something that actually exists. Lawmakers could remove a borrower's liability for re-paying the debt, but the debt will be shifted onto someone"" and ""in the case of federal student loans, the burden would be further shifted onto taxpayers."""
183,183,other,"Foreign Ministry comments on US anti-Russian sanctions over Skripal case A Utah-based left-wing activist is facing criminal charges for allegedly participating in the Capitol Hill riot last week. John Sullivan, who is the founder of Insurgence USA — a social justice group he started after the death of George Floyd — was arrested and charged in federal court in Washington, DC, according to a report by Salt Lake Tribune. An affidavit in support of a criminal complaint and arrest warrant alleges Sullivan “knowingly and willfully joined a crowd of individuals who forcibly entered the U.S. Capitol and impeded, disrupted, and disturbed the orderly conduct of business” by the U.S. House and Senate. While Sullivan claims he attended last week’s “Stop the Steal” march as a journalist, the affidavit signed by FBI Special Agent Matthew Foulger says otherwise. The criminal complaint reads: At various times, Sullivan has claimed to be a journalist. He has admitted, however, that he has no press credentials and the investigation has not revealed any connection between Sullivan and any journalistic organizations. In the affidavit, Foulger goes on to detail videos — that Sullivan provided to the FBI — in which the left-wing activist can allegedly be heard encouraging protesters inside and around the Capitol Building. In one video, Sullivan can be heard — as he approaches the Capitol Building with others — saying, “There are so many people. Let’s go. This shit is ours! Fuck yeah,” “We accomplished this shit. We did this together. Fuck yeah! We are all a part of this history,” and “Let’s burn this shit down.” The affidavit adds that while walking through the Capitol, Sullivan can also be heard saying, “it’s our house motherfuckers,” and “we are getting this shit.” “In at least two encounters, Sullivan can be heard on the video arguing with the officers, telling them to stand down so that they do not get hurt,” reads the criminal complaint. “At one point in the video, Sullivan enters an office within the U.S. Capitol — once inside the office, Sullivan approaches a window — and states, ‘We did this shit. We took this shit.'” the affidavit adds. The criminal complaint goes on to say that at one point, “a knocking noise is heard off-screen. The camera then pans to show more of the window and a broken pane can be seen that was not broken on Sullivan’s approach to the window.” “Sullivan can then be heard saying, ‘I broke it. My bad, my apologies. Well they already broke a window, so, you know, I didn’t know I hit it that hard. No one got that on camera,'” the affidavit continues. “Eventually, individuals in the crowd outside the doors announce that the officers are leaving and ‘giving us the building,'” the affidavit adds. “As the crowd begins to part so the officers can leave, Sullivan can be heard saying, ‘Haul that motherfucker out this bitch.'” At another point in the video, Sullivan is walking down a hallway inside the Capitol Building with a large group of people, and can be heard saying, “Why don’t we go in there” as he pans the camera to a closed door. Then, after someone hits the door, Sullivan can be heard saying, “That’s what I’m sayin’, break that shit.” The affidavit goes on to detail several other examples of Sullivan’s conduct on Capitol Hill that day, adding the activist had also posted some of the videos to social media, under the pseudonym JaydenX. The criminal complaint also notes Sullivan was charged with “Rioting and Criminal Mischief” over the summer by local law enforcement authorities in Provo, Utah. The arrest was in connection with a June protest in which one person was shot and injured. The case is still pending. For his actions on January 6, the left-wing activist faces federal charges of civil disorder, entering a restricted building or grounds, and violent entry or disorderly conduct."
184,184,other,"Adam Castillejo is still free of the virus more than 30 months after stopping anti-retroviral therapy. He was not cured by the HIV drugs, however, but by a stem-cell treatment he received for a cancer he also had, the Lancet HIV journal reports. The donors of those stem cells have an uncommon gene that gives them, and now Mr Castillejo, protection against HIV. In 2011, Timothy Brown, the ""Berlin Patient"" became the first person reported as cured of HIV, three and half years after having similar treatment. Stem-cell transplants appear to stop the virus being able to replicate inside the body by replacing the patient's own immune cells with donor ones that resist HIV infection. Adam Castillejo - the now 40-year-old ""London Patient"" who has decided to go public with his identity - has no detectable active HIV infection in his blood, semen or tissues, his doctors say. It is now a year after they first announced he was clear of the virus and he still remains free of HIV. Lead researcher Prof Ravindra Kumar Gupta, from the University of Cambridge, told BBC News: ""This represents HIV cure with almost certainty. ""We have now had two and a half years with anti-retroviral-free remission. ""Our findings show that the success of stem-cell transplantation as a cure for HIV, first reported nine years ago in the Berlin Patient, can be replicated."" But it will not be a treatment for the millions of people around the world living with HIV. The aggressive therapy was primarily used to treat the patients' cancers, not their HIV. And current HIV drugs remain very effective, meaning people with the virus can live long and healthy lives. Prof Gupta said: ""It is important to note that this curative treatment is high-risk and only used as a last resort for patients with HIV who also have life-threatening haematological malignancies. ""Therefore, this is not a treatment that would be offered widely to patients with HIV who are on successful anti-retroviral treatment."" But it might offer hope of finding a cure, in the future, using gene therapy. How does it work? CCR5 is the most commonly used receptor by HIV-1 - the virus strain of HIV that dominates around the world - to enter cells. But a very small number of people who are resistant to HIV have two mutated copies of the CCR5 receptor. This means the virus cannot penetrate cells in the body it normally infects. Researchers say it may be possible to use gene therapy to target the CCR5 receptor in people with HIV. It is the same receptor the now jailed Chinese scientist He Jiankui worked on when he created the world's first gene-edited babies. Is it a permanent cure? The tests suggest 99% of Mr Castillejo's immune cells have been replaced by donor ones. But he still has remnants of the virus in his body, as does Mr Brown. And it is impossible to say with absolute certainty his HIV will never come back. Mr Castillejo told the New York Times: ""This is a unique position to be in, a unique and very humbling position. ""I want to be an ambassador of hope. ""I don't want people to think, 'Oh, you've been chosen.' ""No, it just happened. ""I was in the right place, probably at the right time, when it happened."" Prof Sharon Lewin, from the University of Melbourne, Australia, said: ""Given the large number of cells sampled here and the absence of any intact virus, is the London Patient truly cured? ""The additional data provided in this follow-up case report is certainly encouraging but unfortunately, in the end, only time will tell.""

The research, which included people in NI, also found that one in four adults who look after children have eaten less so they can feed the children in their household. Sign up to our daily newsletter The i newsletter cut through the noise Sign up Thanks for signing up! Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later. Submitting... Researchers found that half of all adults have tried to cope during the pandemic by purchasing less expensive food which they would not ordinarily choose to buy. Nearly one in three adults who are the least ‘food secure’, and who are looking after children, have also resorted more frequently to eating less so that their children can eat. Kevin Higgins of Advice NI said: “I certainly see these figures as valid for Northern Ireland and this justifies the Covid measures put in place to support people during lockdown.” His organisation, which gives benefits advice, has given extensive support to the vulnerable under lockdown, he said; their NI Covid-19 Community Helpline (0808-802-0020) has answered 18,000 calls since March 27, of which 69% were food related. Mr Higgins also said that some 150,000 food boxes have been distributed across NI under lockdown and that Universal Credit claims in NI have risen from 70,000 to 134,000. “Moving forward I think there needs to be a review of the social security system to ensure it is fit for purpose and provides an adequate income,” he added. Recent improvements to Universal Credit need to be maintained beyond the Covid crisis, he said, and the independent advice sector must be supported to assist people as we emerge from lockdown. Prof Greta Defeyter, director of Northumbria University’s Healthy Living Lab, said: “These findings present an appalling picture of the high percentage of adults experiencing food insecurity in the UK. “If we, as a country, are to stand a chance of getting to grips with this problem, we need the prime minister to oversee and implement with urgency a national food strategy which enhances the supply, affordability, and accessibility of nutritious food to everyone in our country.” This must minimise the need to deploy the many coping strategies, such as the use of food banks, which were identified through the survey, she added. Andrew Forsey, director of Feeding Britain, said: “This survey reveals the lengths to which millions of people in our country are going to keep themselves and their families fed during the pandemic.” The charity is recommending the creation of a jobs programme to prevent long-term unemployment and a review of deductions from Universal Credit and the suspension of the related two-child limit. It is also calling for year-round ‘seamless’ school lunches and breakfasts for children, and tougher employment protections for people in low-paid and precarious work. • FactcheckNI response to this article: Article which claimed that one person in four in Northern Ireland is at risk of hunger was unsubstantiated A message from the Editor: Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Among claimants the court found in favour of since 1975 are murderers, terrorists in Iraq and IRA gunmen. Its recent controversial judgments include refusing a Home Office deportation order for Islamic hate preacher Abu Qatada and insisting prisoners must have the vote. The figures showing that the 297 victories against the UK included 94 prisoners, terrorists or criminals are revealed in a glossy dossier produced by ECHR-supporting pressure group RightsInfo. It is a response to criticisms of the Strasbourg court by Tory ministers and The Sun. Commons Justice Committee chairman Bob Neill MP said: “This is well beyond what any sensible person would say is real human rights. “It’s mission creep, law made by judges who are not judges and many from countries with questionable human rights and very little judicial experience. “Political pressure groups take advantage of that naivety, which costs the British taxpayer considerable sums.” It costs £286million a year to fund the euro judges’ governing body, the Council of Europe and £23million of that comes from British taxes. Since 1959, the UK has won only 41 per cent of 513 ECHR cases. RightsInfo’s Adam Wagner said: “People accused of crimes or convicted of offences have human rights too, so it isn’t surprising that they have featured in 40 years of cases.” The fanatic Hate preacher Abu Qatada Reuters 3 ABU Qatada won the right to stay in Britain rather than be deported to his homeland Jordan after ECHR judges said there was a risk evidence obtained by torture could be used against him in a terror trial. In that case Qatada, described as Osama Bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe, would not get a fair trial. The Strasbourg court’s 2012 decision overturned a ruling by UK law lords. Qatada had been convicted in Jordan in 1999 in his absence of a conspiracy to carry out bombings. He was finally returned in 2013 after Jordan agreed torture evidence would not be used. PRISONER John Hirst first won the right for convicted criminals to vote following a European court ruling in 2005. Hirst had previously lost his claim at the High Court in 2001 but took the case to Europe and won. No UK Government has legislated on the issue despite four rulings in Hirst’s favour by the Strasbourg-based court. Hirst who served 25 years for the unprovoked manslaughter of his landlady, said: “You don’t lose your status in civil society just because you’re in prison — you are still a member of the public.” The IRA men Ulster Unionist MP Ken Maginnis 3 TEN IRA men killed by soldiers and the Royal Ulster Constabulary had their human rights violated, the ECHR ruled in 2001. Its judges said the authorities failed to conduct proper inquiries into the deaths. The UK Government was ordered to pay each of the IRA men’s families £10,000. Tory and Ulster Unionist MPs said the ruling was a disgrace and an insult to those who tried to keep the peace. Unionist Ken Maginnis said: “It now seems common practice as far as the European Courts are concerned to pander to militant Irish republicanism.”"

The news has been paired with predictions of civilization’s imminent demise. But a closer look at the evidence reveals that the political heat is overwrought—and there’s still no reason to re-engineer the global economy to mitigate small climate fluctuations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced this week that last year was the warmest in the agency’s 137-year series, and that 2016 broke the previous record for the third consecutive year. This sounds alarming, until you read that 2016 edged out 2015 by a mere 0.04 degrees Celsius. That’s a fraction of the margin of error. Atmospheric data from satellites detected similarly small warming over previous years. In other words, no one really knows if last year was a record. Here’s what we do know: 2015 and 2016 were major years for El Niño, a Pacific trade winds phenomenon known to produce temperature spikes. The Cato Institute’s Patrick Michaels has detailed in these pages how in 1998, another big El Niño year, average surface temperatures increased about a quarter-degree Fahrenheit and then dropped in the following years. That is similar to the increase in 2015—and by the end of 2016 temperatures were falling back toward 2014 levels. Even NOAA admits El Niño’s role. The underreported news here is that the warming is not nearly as great as the climate-change computer models have predicted. As climatologist Judith Curry testified to Congress in 2014, U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change simulations forecast surface temperatures to increase on average 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade in the early 21st century. The warming over the first 15 years was closer to 0.05 degrees Celsius. The models also can’t explain why more than 40% of the temperature increase since 1900 happened between 1910 and 1945, which accounts for only 10% of the increase in carbon emissions.

What appears to be a solar anomaly close to the Sun's surface is claimed by alien life conspiracy theorists to be a UFO of an almost incomprehensible scale. According to prominent alien hunter Scott Waring, the supposed UFO is at least 'ten times the size of Earth'. Earth's radius is 3,958 miles (6,37km), making the UFO more than 39,580 miles (63,370km km) long. Mr Waring also believes the UFO came from the Sun's core, where it is feeding off our host star's immense energy. The UFO enthusiast said on his etdtabase.com blog: ""In the image, I added light and focus and we can see that the red material is gathering around its hull."

191,191,other,"No help to buy – the flagship government policy that's just misleading The nosediving security situation in the country is increasingly putting President Muhammadu Buhari under pressure as prominent Nigerians, among whom are governors, former political office holders, clerics and Nobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, have started to speak out in condemnation of his alleged inaction. The past two weeks have particularly been traumatic for the country, with killings, abductions and attacks on communities and security agencies, especially as killing of police officers continues unabated. Within the period, bandits operating in Kaduna State invaded a private institution in the State, Greenfield University in Chikun Local Government Area, abducted more than 20 students and killed a staff during the attack. In a gruesome move, the bandits, who asked for N800 million ransom, have killed five of the students to show that they meant business. During the period also, scores of innocent Nigerians were killed in Zamfara State as Boko Haram attempted to take over Geidam in Yobe State and Mainok in Borno State, with the Nigerian military fighting desperately to retake them, albeit at a cost, as some men and officers were lost during the battle. Not done, bandits also attacked and abducted students of the Federal University of Agriculture, Markurdi, the Benue State capital, early in the week. Nothing has been heard about the fate of the students. This is apart from a revelation from the Governor of the State, Samuel Ortom that about 70 residents of the state have been killed in two weeks. The situation in Niger State is fast becoming hopeless, as two LGAs, Munya and Shiroro, have practically become bandits’ killing fields. This was before a shocking revelation by the state governor, Abubakar Sani Bello that Boko Haram insurgents have infiltrated the state, hoisting their flag in Kaure in Munya LGA, an indication that they have declared a caliphate in the area. Also down South, the situation in the South-East geopolitical zone is increasing calling for concerns, as no day passes without reports of attacks on the police formations and personnel. What makes the South-East situation more alarming is that the operation of ‘gunmen’ in the zone have mainly focused on security agents, in what reminds Nigerians about the formative days of the Boko Haram insurgency. This has no doubt raised comcerns in several circles of an evolving insurgency in Igboland, a situation many believe Nigeria may not be able to cope with, especially with the current insurgency in North-East and banditry in the North-West and North Central. Realising that the security situation in the country was practically spiralling out of control, prominent Nigerians decided to speak out, putting further pressure on the Buhari administration, which many Nigerians said has proven unable to proffer solution to the hydra headed security challenges in the country. In a rather frustrated outburst, Nasir el-Rufai, Governor of Kaduna State, who has constantly shown his disgust for the bandits operating in his state, pointedly declared that what the bandits and other criminal elements terrorising the country deserve is deaths. He said, “kill them all”. According to him, no one staying in the forests is innocent and what they deserve is death, opening a floodgate of intervention, angry outbursts and advice from prominent Nigerians. Respected Nobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, shortly after the killing of three of the abducted students of Greenfield University, pointedly told President Buhari to swallow his pride and seek for help! “Seek Help. Stop Improvising with Human Lives. Youth – that is, the future – should not serve as ritual offering on the altar of a failing State”, he said in a statement on Saturday. According to Soyinka, Nigeria is at war but the government continues to pretend that “these are mere birth-pangs of a glorious entity”. He however, said the current situation in the country suggests death throes, adding, “Vultures and undertakers hover patiently but with full confidence.” “The dogs of war stopped merely baying years ago. Again and again, they have sunk their fangs into the jugular of this nation. The plague called COVID has met its match on the earth of some nation space once known as Nigeria”, Soyinka painted a scary picture of the Nigerian situation. The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), perhaps to show that it is a party with a soul, admitted, albeit for the first time that insecurity is real in the country. Before admitting what other Nigerians have always known in a statement by its National Secretary, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, the APC had always beaten its chest that the Buhari administration has improved security in the country tremendously since coming into office in 2015. They also claimed that the security situation in the country had improved from what it used to be under the Goodluck Jonathan administration that ended on May 29, 2015. However, the party said: “The issue of insecurity in the country has found expression in terrorist and criminal activities of Boko Haram, bandits, kidnappers, rustlers and recently the highly condemnable attacks on security formations in some states. “These are current realities and the APC will not playing politics with matters of life and our collective wellbeing as a nation.” For many Nigerians, the admittance by the ruling party that all is not well with the country, may after all spur the government of the nation into action. This is because of the belief that the party and the country has always lived in denial of the actual situation in the country. Majority of Nigerians who watched the viral video of Niger State Governor, Abubakar Sani Bello talking about the situation in his state cut a pitiable sight of a man who is frustrated, not just for his inability to secure his people but also knowing that a greater evil, Boko Haram has taken residence right in his backyard. The Governor, in the video, while he went visiting about 3000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) taking refugee at a school in Minna, the state capital, said that Boko Haram insurgents are already in the state. He said: “I am confirming that there are Boko Haram elements in Niger State, around Kaure. “I just heard that they’ve already hoisted their flag in Kaure, which means they’ve taken over the territory and this is what I have been engaging the FG with, and unfortunately it has now gotten to this stage that if care is not taken, not even Abuja is safe. “They’ve taken over the territory, they’ve installed their flag. I am confirming that now. They’ve taken over the wives of people by force. “Boko Haram elements are trying to use these areas as their home just like they did in Sambisa.” In what seems like a double speak, Governor Bello said: “I have not lost hope from the federal government but I am not waiting for anyone anymore.” DAILY POST recalls that Niger State has had history with the Boko Haram insurgency, as the state was at a time used as a launching pad for attempted incursions into Abuja in the hey days of the group. Joining his voice to calls by the Buhari administration to seek for help in tackling the declining security situation in the country, the Immediate-past Senate President, Bukola Saraki, on Tuesday, said the President needs help and he must seek for one. Saraki, who said it was obvious that Buhari was already overwhelmed, said the situation “cannot continue” and “cannot become Nigeria’s new normal”. He said: “It is obvious that President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress government need help. They have been overwhelmed by the situation and they sure need assistance from all. Thus, I urge Mr. President to seek help wherever it can be given. This matter has gone beyond what the government can handle alone. The President should know that calling for help in our present situation is not a sign of weakness.” According to Saraki, President Buhari needs to bring together all former Presidents and heads of state, serving and former chief justices, serving and former presiding officers of the National Assembly, serving and former heads of security agencies, traditional rulers with relevant experience, leaders of the private sector, development partners, friends of Nigeria in the international community and all others who can help in finding solutions to the problem at hand. “The meeting must hold expeditiously and must be followed by immediate actions. I know there are many people who believe that the fact that this suggestion is coming from a source outside government is a good reason for the President to ignore it. I think the attitude this time around must be different. This is definitely not a time for partisanship or for people to play politics with the lives of the citizenry and the future of the country. “I appeal to Mr. President to take the bull by the horn. He should act to stem the tide of this violence threatening to tear the country apart,” he added. Following in the footsteps of Saraki, his former deputy at the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, also on Tuesday, called on the Federal Government to seek foreign help to fight insecurity in the country. Ekweremadu made the call while contributing to a motion moved during plenary by Senator Sani Musa on the activities of bandits and Boko Haram terrorists in Shiroro and Rafi Local Government Areas of Niger State. According to Senator Ekweremadu, any government that fails to protect its citizens has lost its legitimacy, therefore, the Federal Government should not be ashamed to seek foreign support, while also calling for a shutdown of Niger to enable security agencies to deal with the problem. On his part, a former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar warned that there is looming darkness over the country, if the attacks on schools and abduction of students continue. Calling for a 24-hour arms guard in schools, Atiku opined that if the current situation persists, school enrollment will further decline. He said in a statement: “The abduction of yet an unspecific number of undergraduates of the Federal University of Agriculture, Makurdi, Benue State, is one abduction too many. It marks both an unacceptable escalation and an expansion of this menace, and we must not only ensure that the abducted youths are rescued, but even more importantly, we must put in measures to prevent future reoccurrences. “This must not be allowed to become our new normal. It is time for us as a nation to face the reality that we have an emergency on our hands. A catastrophe that must be decisively dealt with before it snowballs into an existential crisis. “We must stop treating these acts of criminality with kid gloves. Enough is enough! There must be safety of lives and property in our citadels of learning, because without it, there would be loss of confidence in the sector, which will result in low enrolment rates in a country that is amongst the highest statistically for out-of-school children. “I renew the call I made on Monday, March 15, 2021, for a state of emergency to be declared on the education sector, and for 24 hour armed guards to be posted at all schools in the affected states. “Yes, it is an expensive venture. Nevertheless, we must accept that whatever we invest in preserving the lives of Nigerian youths is worth the price, as nothing is, or can be more valuable to us than our youths, who will take up the baton after we are gone.” To put the icing on the cake, the usually blunt Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, on Tuesday accused President Muhammadu Buhari of working for Fulanis to take over Nigeria. The Governor said: “What is happening now, to me, is very clear; Mr President is just working for these Fulanis to take over the whole country. “His body language is what is being played out. The body language, the action and inaction of Mr President shows that he is only the President of Fulani people; I have known this. “We are becoming a Banana Republic. If we have a President who gave the security agencies order to shoot at sight whosoever is having AK-47 and the Minister of Defence came out to say that they cannot shoot at sight. So who is the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces?” According to Ortom, the people of Benue are being overstretched and running out of patience due to the incessant attacks on their communities. “Mr President must rise up. He is the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and over the 250 nationalities that are in this country; Mr President is their President, we all voted him. “He has taken oath of office to secure the country and provide security for lives and property; this is unacceptable, this cannot continue,” he said."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) claimed the world ""is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change."" But according to new data from NASA, one of the previously fastest shrinking glaciers in the world is growing again, calling into question the narrative that rapid climate change — i.e., global warming — poses a significant threat to the existence of the human race, let alone the entire planet. What are the details? For the last 20 years, the Jakobshavn Glacier in Greenland was one of the fastest shrinking ice sheets in the world, losing on average 1.8 miles of ice annually while thinning 130 feet per year, according to The Associated Press. But in 2016 something changed: The glacier began growing again, at about the same rate it was previously retreating, researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said in a newly published Nature Geoscience journal article. ""At first we didn't believe it. We had pretty much assumed that Jakobshavn would just keep going on as it had over the last 20 years,"" Ala Khazendar, the study's lead author, said, according to USA Today. More from the AP: A natural cyclical cooling of North Atlantic waters likely caused the glacier to reverse course, said study lead author Ala Khazendar, a NASA glaciologist on the Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) project. Khazendar and colleagues say this coincides with a flip of the North Atlantic Oscillation — a natural and temporary cooling and warming of parts of the ocean that is like a distant cousin to El Nino in the Pacific. The water in Disko Bay, where Jakobshavn hits the ocean, is about 3.6 degrees cooler than a few years ago, study authors said. In fact, the study said the waters in the region have cooled to temperatures not seen in more than 30 years. What does this mean for the future? While the development seems positive on the surface, it could spell bad news for the overall direction of the climate. NASA climate scientist Josh Willis, who participated in the study, noted that while the glacier's growth is positive, the study proves that glaciers are more sensitive to ocean temperature changes than previously thought, which could mean disaster in the future if the oceans experience sudden warming. ""All this is an indicator of how sensitive glaciers are to ocean temperatures,"" Khazendar explained to National Geographic. Meanwhile, University of Washington ice scientist Ian Joughin compared NASA's latest findings to that of the stock market. ""[The glacier's growth is] to a large extent, a temporary blip. Downturns do occur in the stock market, but overall the long-term trajectory is up. This is really the same thing,"" he told the AP."
194,194,other,"Opportunities Foreclosed Equity Denied New York’s Youngest Learners Still Left Out! Make Quality Early Learning Top Priority In 2018 Budget Iran Parliamentarians have moved a bill in order to protect the rights of children which includes a clause that lets a man marry his own adopted daughter considering the fact that she is 13 years old. However, activists of the country have expressed alarm that the bill sanctioned by parliament, gives an opportunity for the caretaker of a family to marry his or her adopted child if a court orders it is in the best interests of the individual child. Credits: Care2.com Iran’s Guardian Council, a body of clerics and jurists which reviews all parliamentary bills before the constitution and the Islamic law, has yet to give its final verdict on the controversial legislation. To the shock of rights campaigners, girls in the Islamic republic can marry as young as 13 years old if they seek permission from their father. On the other hand, boys can marry only after the age of 15. In Iran, a girl under the age of 13 can still marry but needs a judge’s permission. As of now, however, marrying stepchildren is prohibited under any circumstances. 42,000 children aged between 10 and 14 got married in the year 2010, as per the Iranian news website Tabnak. At least 75 children under the age of 10 were married in Tehran alone. Shadi Sadr who is a human rights lawyer with the London-based group Justice for Iran, told the Guardian website that she feared the council would feel safe and secure to put its stamp of acceptance on the bill while Iran’s moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, grabs the attention of the press during his UN visit to New York. “This bill is legalising paedophilia,” she alerted. “It’s not part of the Iranian culture to marry your adopted child. Obviously, incest exists in Iran more or less as it happens in other countries across the world, but this bill is legalising paedophilia and is endangering our children and normalising this crime in our culture.” She added: “You should not be able to marry your adopted children, full stop. If a father marries his adopted daughter who is a minor and has sex, that’s rape.” As per Sadr, Iran officials tried to play down the sexual part of such marriages, adding that it is in the bill to fix the issue of hijab [head scarf] complications when a child is adopted. An adopted daughter is likely to wear the hijab in front of her dad, and a mother should wear it only in front of her adopted son if he is old enough, Sadr said. “With this bill, you can be a paedophile and get your bait in the pretext of adopting children,” Sadr said. Some experts reckon that the new bill is opposed to Islamic beliefs and would not pass the Guardian Council. However, an initial draft of the bill, which totally banned marriage with adopted children, was not sanctioned by the council and it is feared that MPs introduced the condition for marriage only to satisfy the jurists and clergymen. This is the reason why Sadr fears it can pass the council this time. The bill drew huge backlash in Iran with the reformist newspaper, Shargh, posting an article warning about its consequences. “How can someone be looking after you and at the same time be your husband?” the article asked. Shiva Dolatabadi who is the head of Iran’s society for protecting children’s rights gave a warning that the bill implies that the parliament is legalising incest. “You cannot open a way in which the role of a father or a mother can be mixed with that of a spouse,” she said, according to Shargh. “Children can’t be safe in such a family.” Though the bill was passed in 2013 as per media report, the news is getting unnecessary attention on social media in 2019. Some netizens are still protesting on social media against the very bill."

Speaking to Russia’s top military brass after watching the live feed of the launch of the Avangard vehicle from the Defense Ministry’s control room, Putin said the successful test was a “great success” and an “excellent New Year’s gift to the nation.” The test comes amid bitter tensions in Russia-U.S. relations, which have sunk to their lowest level since the Cold War times over the conflict in Ukraine, the war in Syria and the allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Putin's hopes for repairing ties with Washington under President Donald Trump have fizzled amid investigations into allegations of Trump's campaign ties with Russia, and tensions have escalated as the U.S. administration slapped Russia with new waves of sanctions. The Avangard was among the array of new nuclear weapons that Putin presented in March, saying that Russia had to develop them in response to the development of the U.S. missile defense system that could erode Russia’s nuclear deterrent.

A new bombshell paper from the Beijing-sponsored South China University of Technology says that the Wuhan Center for Disease Control WHCDC could have spawned the contagion in Hubei province. 'The possible origins of 2019-nCoV coronavirus,' penned by scholars Botao Xiao and Lei Xiao claims the WHCDC kept disease-ridden animals in laboratories, including 605 bats. It also mentions that bats - which are linked to coronavirus - once attacked a researcher and 'blood of bat was on his skin.' Workers in protective gear carry a bag containing a giant salamander that was reported to have escaped from the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan in central China's Hubei Province in January The report says: 'Genome sequences from patients were 96% or 89% identical to the Bat CoV ZC45 coronavirus originally found in Rhinolophus affinis intermediate horseshoe bat.' It describes how the only native bats are found around 600 miles away from the Wuhan seafood market and that the probability of bats flying from Yunnan and Zhejiang provinces was minimal. In addition there is little to suggest the local populace eat the bats as evidenced by testimonies of 31 residents and 28 visitors. Instead the authors point to research being carried out withing a few hundred yards at the WHCDC. One of the researchers at the WHCDC described quarantining himself for two weeks after a bat's blood got on his skin, according to the report. That same man also quarantined himself after a bat urinated on him. 'The WHCDC was also adjacent to the Union Hospital Figure 1, bottom where the first group of doctors were infected during this epidemic.' The report says. And he also mentions discovering a live tick from a bat - parasites known for their ability to pass infections through a host animal's blood. 'The WHCDC was also adjacent to the Union Hospital Figure 1, bottom where the first group of doctors were infected during this epidemic.' The report says.

Early help by local authorities has been a casualty of government spending cuts, say the Children's Society and National Children's Bureau NCB. They say failure to intervene early means a greater cost to taxpayers later and will damage young lives. The government said it had increased early intervention funding. Early intervention funding - previously called the early intervention grant - enables local authorities to step in and help a child or young person who is vulnerable or at risk. The help includes advice on teenage pregnancy or drugs and alcohol, and help from children's centres and early years services. In a report - Cuts that cost: Trends in funding for early intervention services - research suggests that government funding for a range of early help services in England fell from £3.2bn in 2010 to £1.4bn in 2015. The charities say there are early indications, from a Freedom of Information request by the publication Children & Young People Now, that reductions in spending are set to continue for children's centres and services in 2015-16. A fund set up for the most vulnerable families in society, the Troubled Families programme, is expected to increase or remain stable. Preventing crises Experts in social work and child protection have suggested a potential link between the rise of child protection cases and the reduction in spending on early intervention services. Levels of demand on the child protection and care systems can provide some indication of the effectiveness of services that work to support families struggling to care for their children and prevent them reaching crisis point, says the report. Small child left aloneimage copyrightThinkstock image captionEarly intervention can turn around a child's life, says the report Matthew Reed, chief executive of the Children's Society, said: Early intervention and help for children of all ages improves their lives, stops damage, and prevents more costly remedial solutions in the subsequent few years. That's why we are calling on government to prioritise funding for early intervention and help for teenagers and children to make sure councils can maintain these essential services as we enter another period of austerity. If we keep cutting early help now it will cost us all dearly in the long run. A government spokesman said: Ensuring every child, regardless of their background, is given the opportunity to fulfil their potential is at the heart of this government's drive to provide real social justice. We have invested more than £2bn in early intervention services, including 15 hours of free childcare for the most disadvantaged two-year-olds and enough funding to retain a national network of children's centres, which are helping a record number of parents. We have given councils the freedom to use their funds on those services most needed by their communities. The £448m Troubled Families programme has turned around the lives of 117,000 of the most complex families, working with up to 400,000 more families from this year, backed with a further £200m investment."
203,203,other,"Enemies Of APC Sponsoring Boko Haram Insurgency, Banditry –Katsina Governor, Masari The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has yet again been caught exaggerating ‘global warming’ by fiddling with the raw temperature data. This time, that data concerns the recent record-breaking cold across the northeastern U.S. which NOAA is trying to erase from history. If you believe NOAA’s charts, there was nothing particularly unusual about this winter’s cold weather which caused sharks to freeze in the ocean and iguanas to drop out of trees. Here is NOAA’s January 2018 chart for Northeast U.S. – an area which includes New England along with NY, PA, NJ, DE and MD. You’d never guess from it that those regions had just experienced record-breaking cold, would you? That’s because, as Paul Homewood has discovered, NOAA has been cooking the books. Yet again – presumably for reasons more to do with ideology than meteorology – NOAA has adjusted past temperatures to look colder than they were and recent temperatures to look warmer than they were. We’re not talking fractions of a degree, here. The adjustments amount to a whopping 3.1 degrees F. This takes us well beyond the regions of error margins or innocent mistakes and deep into the realm of fiction and political propaganda. Homewood first smelt a rat when he examined the New York data sets. He was particularly puzzled at NOAA’s treatment of the especially cold winter that ravaged New York in 2013/14, which he describes here: The cold weather really began on Jan 2nd, when an Arctic front descended across much of the country, and extended well into March. The NWS wrote at the end of the winter: The winter of 2013-14 finished as one of the coldest winters in recent memory for New York State. Snowfall across Western and North Central New York was above normal for many areas, and in some locations well above normal. This winter comes on the heels of two previous mild winters, making the cold and snow this winter feel that much harsher. Temperatures this winter finished below normal every month, and the January through March timeframe finished at least 4 degrees below normal for the two primary climate stations of Western New York (Buffalo and Rochester)….. Relentless cold continued through the month of January across the region. So why, he wondered, did NOAA have this marked down as only the 30th coldest winter (since 1895) on its New York State charts, with a mean temperature of 16.9F? Homewood compared the local records for January 1943 and January 2014 – months which, according to NOAA’s charts, had very similar average temperatures. What he found was that NOAA’s charts were deeply inaccurate. The 2014 local temperatures had been adjusted upwards by NOAA and the 1943 local temperatures downwards. He concludes: On average the mean temperatures in Jan 2014 were 2.7F less than in 1943. Yet, according to NOAA, the difference was only 0.9F. Somehow, NOAA has adjusted past temperatures down, relatively, by 1.8F. Now, Homewood has given the same treatment to the most recent Big Freeze – the winter of 2017/2018. Yet again, he has found that NOAA’s arbitrary adjustments tell a lie. They claim that January 2018 was warmer in the New York region than January 1943, when the raw data from local stations tells us this just isn’t true. So at the three sites of Ithaca, Auburn and Geneva, we find that January 2018 was colder than January 1943 by 1.0, 1.7 and 1.3F respectively. Yet NOAA say that the division was 2.1F warmer last month. NOAA’s figure makes last month at least 3.1F warmer in comparison with 1943 than the actual station data warrants. He concludes: Clearly NOAA’s highly homogenised and adjusted version of the Central Lakes temperature record bears no resemblance at all the the actual station data. And if this one division is so badly in error, what confidence can there be that the rest of the US is any better? Well indeed. The key point here is that while NOAA frequently makes these adjustments to the raw data, it has never offered a convincing explanation as to why they are necessary. Nor yet, how exactly their adjusted data provides a more accurate version of the truth than the original data. One excuse NOAA’s apologists make is that weather stations are subject to changing environmental conditions. For example, when the station sited at Syracuse in 1929 was located at what was originally just a sparse aerodrome. Since then, however, as Homewood notes, it has grown into a large international airport with two runways servicing two million passengers a year. Its weather station readings therefore will certainly have been corrupted by the Urban Heat Island effect: that is, its temperature readings will have been artificially elevated by the warmth from the surrounding development and aircraft engines. So you’d think, wouldn’t you, that to compensate for this NOAA would adjust the recent temperatures downwards. Instead, for no obvious reasons, it has adjusted them upwards. This is a scandal. NOAA’s climate gatekeepers are political activists not honest scientists and the U.S. taxpayer has no business funding their propaganda. Drain the swamp!"

A monthly analysis of forecasts prepared for Chancellor Philip Hammond showed that dozens of independent experts believe national output will continue growing this year. On average, they expect growth to continue at exactly the same rate as forecast before the EU referendum. Contrary to what economists and big banks like Goldman Sachs said, Brexit has heralded a new wave of growth as Britain prepares to unshackle itself from Brussels Craig Mackinlay The verdict was a major reversal following earlier expectations that the country’s decision to leave the EU would deliver a massive shock to the economy. Instead, the data suggests that the historic vote had no significant impact on growth at all. The u-turn was being seen last night as yet another devastating blow to the “Project Fear” scaremongering campaign run by the defeated and embittered supporters of Britain’s EU membership. GETTY Forecasts for Chancellor Philip Hammond showed that national output will continue growing this year GETTY Craig Mackinlay said in just three months 'Project Fear had descended to Project Farce' And it came amid growing expectations in the City that the Government is preparing for a “hard Brexit” that will mean quitting the EU single market and imposing full border controls. Tory MP Craig Mackinlay, who backed the Leave campaign, said: “In just three months Project Fear has descended into Project Farce. “Contrary to what economists and big banks like Goldman Sachs said, Brexit has heralded a new wave of growth as Britain prepares to unshackle itself from Brussels. “With new global free trade deals on the horizon the British economy has never looked so buoyant.” Brexit aftershocks: Who's next to leave the EU?

205,205,other,"White House considers arguing that Trump wasn't impeached If you needed any more proof that the migrant caravans at our Southern border are NOT what they appear to be, now these invaders are making a new demand. Now these “migrants” are saying “give us $50,000 each to return home, or else we’ll bust down your border,” as Fox News reports: Two groups of Central American migrants marched to the U.S. Consulate in Tijuana on Tuesday with a list of demands, with one group delivering an ultimatum to the Trump administration: either let them in the U.S. or pay them $50,000 each to go home, a report said. Among other demands were that deportations be halted and that asylum seekers be processed faster and in greater numbers, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. The first group of caravan members, that included about 100 migrants, arrived at the consulate around 11 a.m. Alfonso Guerreo Ulloa, an organizer from Honduras, said the $50,000 figure was chosen as a group. “It may seem like a lot of money to you,” Ulloa told the paper. “But it is a small sum compared to everything the United States has stolen from Honduras.” Now the solution is clear. Protect our border with deadly force, force these folks back home without a penny. Under no circumstances should these invaders be let in. A letter from the second group of about 50 migrants arrived at the consulate around 1:20 p.m. asking the U.S. to speed up the asylum process and to admit up to 300 asylum seekers each day at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in San Diego. Currently, around 40 to 100 are admitted. “In the meantime, families, women and children who have fled our countries continue to suffer and the civil society of Tijuana continue to be forced to confront this humanitarian crisis, a refugee crisis caused in great part by decades of U.S. intervention in Central America,” the letter states. Of the roughly 6,000 migrants who’ve traveled from Central America to Tijuana, around 700 have returned home, 300 have been deported and 2,500 have applied for humanitarian visas in Mexico, according to Xochtil Castillo, a caravan member who met with Mexican officials Tuesday. Now it’s time to use maximum force to remove these invaders from our Southern Border. Maybe the President should shut it completely until such time as Mexico deals with it."

207,207,other," Historians may look to 2015 as the year when shit really started hitting the fan. Some snapshots: In just the past few months, record-setting heat waves in Pakistan and India each killed more than 1,000 people. In Washington state’s Olympic National Park, the rainforest caught fire for the first time in living memory. London reached 98 degrees Fahrenheit during the hottest July day ever recorded in the U.K.; The Guardian briefly had to pause its live blog of the heat wave because its computer servers overheated. In California, suffering from its worst drought in a millennium, a 50-acre brush fire swelled seventyfold in a matter of hours, jumping across the I-15 freeway during rush-hour traffic. Then, a few days later, the region was pounded by intense, virtually unheard-of summer rains. Puerto Rico is under its strictest water rationing in history as a monster El Niño forms in the tropical Pacific Ocean, shifting weather patterns worldwide. On July 20th, James Hansen, the former NASA climatologist who brought climate change to the public’s attention in the summer of 1988, issued a bombshell: He and a team of climate scientists had identified a newly important feedback mechanism off the coast of Antarctica that suggests mean sea levels could rise 10 times faster than previously predicted: 10 feet by 2065. The authors included this chilling warning: If emissions aren’t cut, “We conclude that multi-meter sea-level rise would become practically unavoidable. Social disruption and economic consequences of such large sea-level rise could be devastating. It is not difficult to imagine that conflicts arising from forced migrations and economic collapse might make the planet ungovernable, threatening the fabric of civilization.” Eric Rignot, a climate scientist at NASA and the University of California-Irvine and a co-author on Hansen’s study, said their new research doesn’t necessarily change the worst-case scenario on sea-level rise, it just makes it much more pressing to think about and discuss, especially among world leaders. In particular, says Rignot, the new research shows a two-degree Celsius rise in global temperature — the previously agreed upon “safe” level of climate change — “would be a catastrophe for sea-level rise.” Hansen’s new study also shows how complicated and unpredictable climate change can be. Even as global ocean temperatures rise to their highest levels in recorded history, some parts of the ocean, near where ice is melting exceptionally fast, are actually cooling, slowing ocean circulation currents and sending weather patterns into a frenzy. Sure enough, a persistently cold patch of ocean is starting to show up just south of Greenland, exactly where previous experimental predictions of a sudden surge of freshwater from melting ice expected it to be. Michael Mann, another prominent climate scientist, recently said of the unexpectedly sudden Atlantic slowdown, “This is yet another example of where observations suggest that climate model predictions may be too conservative when it comes to the pace at which certain aspects of climate change are proceeding.” Since storm systems and jet streams in the United States and Europe partially draw their energy from the difference in ocean temperatures, the implication of one patch of ocean cooling while the rest of the ocean warms is profound. Storms will get stronger, and sea-level rise will accelerate. Scientists like Hansen only expect extreme weather to get worse in the years to come, though Mann said it was still “unclear” whether recent severe winters on the East Coast are connected to the phenomenon. And yet, these aren’t even the most disturbing changes happening to the Earth’s biosphere that climate scientists are discovering this year. For that, you have to look not at the rising sea levels but to what is actually happening within the oceans themselves. Water temperatures this year in the North Pacific have never been this high for this long over such a large area — and it is already having a profound effect on marine life. Related: Apocalypse Soon: 9 Terrifying Signs of Environmental Doom Eighty-year-old Roger Thomas runs whale-watching trips out of San Francisco. On an excursion earlier this year, Thomas spotted 25 humpbacks and three blue whales. During a survey on July 4th, federal officials spotted 115 whales in a single hour near the Farallon Islands — enough to issue a boating warning. Humpbacks are occasionally seen offshore in California, but rarely so close to the coast or in such numbers. Why are they coming so close to shore? Exceptionally warm water has concentrated the krill and anchovies they feed on into a narrow band of relatively cool coastal water. The whales are having a heyday. “It’s unbelievable,” Thomas told a local paper. “Whales are all over the place.” Last fall, in northern Alaska, in the same part of the Arctic where Shell is planning to drill for oil, federal scientists discovered 35,000 walruses congregating on a single beach. It was the largest-ever documented “haul out” of walruses, and a sign that sea ice, their favored habitat, is becoming harder and harder to find. Marine life is moving north, adapting in real time to the warming ocean. Great white sharks have been sighted breeding near Monterey Bay, California, the farthest north that’s ever been known to occur. A blue marlin was caught last summer near Catalina Island — 1,000 miles north of its typical range. Across California, there have been sightings of non-native animals moving north, such as Mexican red crabs. No species may be as uniquely endangered as the one most associated with the Pacific Northwest, the salmon. Every two weeks, Bill Peterson, an oceanographer and senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Oregon, takes to the sea to collect data he uses to forecast the return of salmon. What he’s been seeing this year is deeply troubling. Salmon are crucial to their coastal ecosystem like perhaps few other species on the planet. A significant portion of the nitrogen in West Coast forests has been traced back to salmon, which can travel hundreds of miles upstream to lay their eggs. The largest trees on Earth simply wouldn’t exist without salmon. But their situation is precarious. This year, officials in California are bringing salmon downstream in convoys of trucks, because river levels are too low and the temperatures too warm for them to have a reasonable chance of surviving. One species, the winter-run Chinook salmon, is at a particularly increased risk of decline in the next few years, should the warm water persist offshore. “You talk to fishermen, and they all say: ‘We’ve never seen anything like this before,’ ” says Peterson. “So when you have no experience with something like this, it gets like, ‘What the hell’s going on?’ “ Atmospheric scientists increasingly believe that the exceptionally warm waters over the past months are the early indications of a phase shift in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a cyclical warming of the North Pacific that happens a few times each century. Positive phases of the PDO have been known to last for 15 to 20 years, during which global warming can increase at double the rate as during negative phases of the PDO. It also makes big El Niños, like this year’s, more likely. The nature of PDO phase shifts is unpredictable — climate scientists simply haven’t yet figured out precisely what’s behind them and why they happen when they do. It’s not a permanent change — the ocean’s temperature will likely drop from these record highs, at least temporarily, some time over the next few years — but the impact on marine species will be lasting, and scientists have pointed to the PDO as a global-warming preview. “The climate [change] models predict this gentle, slow increase in temperature,” says Peterson, “but the main problem we’ve had for the last few years is the variability is so high. As scientists, we can’t keep up with it, and neither can the animals.” Peterson likens it to a boxer getting pummeled round after round: “At some point, you knock them down, and the fight is over.” Attendant with this weird wildlife behavior is a stunning drop in the number of plankton — the basis of the ocean’s food chain. In July, another major study concluded that acidifying oceans are likely to have a “quite traumatic” impact on plankton diversity, with some species dying out while others flourish. As the oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, it’s converted into carbonic acid — and the pH of seawater declines. According to lead author Stephanie Dutkiewicz of MIT, that trend means “the whole food chain is going to be different.” The Hansen study may have gotten more attention, but the Dutkiewicz study, and others like it, could have even more dire implications for our future. The rapid changes Dutkiewicz and her colleagues are observing have shocked some of their fellow scientists into thinking that yes, actually, we’re heading toward the worst-case scenario. Unlike a prediction of massive sea-level rise just decades away, the warming and acidifying oceans represent a problem that seems to have kick-started a mass extinction on the same time scale. Jacquelyn Gill is a paleoecologist at the University of Maine. She knows a lot about extinction, and her work is more relevant than ever. Essentially, she’s trying to save the species that are alive right now by learning more about what killed off the ones that aren’t. The ancient data she studies shows “really compelling evidence that there can be events of abrupt climate change that can happen well within human life spans. We’re talking less than a decade.” For the past year or two, a persistent change in winds over the North Pacific has given rise to what meteorologists and oceanographers are calling “the blob” — a highly anomalous patch of warm water between Hawaii, Alaska and Baja California that’s thrown the marine ecosystem into a tailspin. Amid warmer temperatures, plankton numbers have plummeted, and the myriad species that depend on them have migrated or seen their own numbers dwindle. Significant northward surges of warm water have happened before, even frequently. El Niño, for example, does this on a predictable basis. But what’s happening this year appears to be something new. Some climate scientists think that the wind shift is linked to the rapid decline in Arctic sea ice over the past few years, which separate research has shown makes weather patterns more likely to get stuck. A similar shift in the behavior of the jet stream has also contributed to the California drought and severe polar vortex winters in the Northeast over the past two years. An amplified jet-stream pattern has produced an unusual doldrum off the West Coast that’s persisted for most of the past 18 months. Daniel Swain, a Stanford University meteorologist, has called it the “Ridiculously Resilient Ridge” — weather patterns just aren’t supposed to last this long. What’s increasingly uncontroversial among scientists is that in many ecosystems, the impacts of the current off-the-charts temperatures in the North Pacific will linger for years, or longer. The largest ocean on Earth, the Pacific is exhibiting cyclical variability to greater extremes than other ocean basins. While the North Pacific is currently the most dramatic area of change in the world’s oceans, it’s not alone: Globally, 2014 was a record-setting year for ocean temperatures, and 2015 is on pace to beat it soundly, boosted by the El Niño in the Pacific. Six percent of the world’s reefs could disappear before the end of the decade, perhaps permanently, thanks to warming waters. Since warmer oceans expand in volume, it’s also leading to a surge in sea-level rise. One recent study showed a slowdown in Atlantic Ocean currents, perhaps linked to glacial melt from Greenland, that caused a four-inch rise in sea levels along the Northeast coast in just two years, from 2009 to 2010. To be sure, it seems like this sudden and unpredicted surge was only temporary, but scientists who studied the surge estimated it to be a 1-in-850-year event, and it’s been blamed on accelerated beach erosion “almost as significant as some hurricane events.” Possibly worse than rising ocean temperatures is the acidification of the waters. Acidification has a direct effect on mollusks and other marine animals with hard outer bodies: A striking study last year showed that, along the West Coast, the shells of tiny snails are already dissolving, with as-yet-unknown consequences on the ecosystem. One of the study’s authors, Nina Bednaršek, told Science magazine that the snails’ shells, pitted by the acidifying ocean, resembled “cauliflower” or “sandpaper.” A similarly striking study by more than a dozen of the world’s top ocean scientists this July said that the current pace of increasing carbon emissions would force an “effectively irreversible” change on ocean ecosystems during this century. In as little as a decade, the study suggested, chemical changes will rise significantly above background levels in nearly half of the world’s oceans. “I used to think it was kind of hard to make things in the ocean go extinct,” James Barry of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California told the Seattle Times in 2013. “But this change we’re seeing is happening so fast it’s almost instantaneous.” Thanks to the pressure we’re putting on the planet’s ecosystem — warming, acidification and good old-fashioned pollution — the oceans are set up for several decades of rapid change. Here’s what could happen next. The combination of excessive nutrients from agricultural runoff, abnormal wind patterns and the warming oceans is already creating seasonal dead zones in coastal regions when algae blooms suck up most of the available oxygen. The appearance of low-oxygen regions has doubled in frequency every 10 years since 1960 and should continue to grow over the coming decades at an even greater rate. So far, dead zones have remained mostly close to the coasts, but in the 21st century, deep-ocean dead zones could become common. These low-oxygen regions could gradually expand in size — potentially thousands of miles across — which would force fish, whales, pretty much everything upward. If this were to occur, large sections of the temperate deep oceans would suffer should the oxygen-free layer grow so pronounced that it stratifies, pushing surface ocean warming into overdrive and hindering upwelling of cooler, nutrient-rich deeper water. Enhanced evaporation from the warmer oceans will create heavier downpours, perhaps destabilizing the root systems of forests, and accelerated runoff will pour more excess nutrients into coastal areas, further enhancing dead zones. In the past year, downpours have broken records in Long Island, Phoenix, Detroit, Baltimore, Houston and Pensacola, Florida. Evidence for the above scenario comes in large part from our best understanding of what happened 250 million years ago, during the “Great Dying,” when more than 90 percent of all oceanic species perished after a pulse of carbon dioxide and methane from land-based sources began a period of profound climate change. The conditions that triggered “Great Dying” took hundreds of thousands of years to develop. But humans have been emitting carbon dioxide at a much quicker rate, so the current mass extinction only took 100 years or so to kick-start. With all these stressors working against it, a hypoxic feedback loop could wind up destroying some of the oceans’ most species-rich ecosystems within our lifetime. A recent study by Sarah Moffitt of the University of California-Davis said it could take the ocean thousands of years to recover. “Looking forward for my kid, people in the future are not going to have the same ocean that I have today,” Moffitt said. As you might expect, having tickets to the front row of a global environmental catastrophe is taking an increasingly emotional toll on scientists, and in some cases pushing them toward advocacy. Of the two dozen or so scientists I interviewed for this piece, virtually all drifted into apocalyptic language at some point. For Simone Alin, an oceanographer focusing on ocean acidification at NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle, the changes she’s seeing hit close to home. The Puget Sound is a natural laboratory for the coming decades of rapid change because its waters are naturally more acidified than most of the world’s marine ecosystems. The local oyster industry here is already seeing serious impacts from acidifying waters and is going to great lengths to avoid a total collapse. Alin calls oysters, which are non-native, the canary in the coal mine for the Puget Sound: “A canary is also not native to a coal mine, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a good indicator of change.” Though she works on fundamental oceanic changes every day, the Dutkiewicz study on the impending large-scale changes to plankton caught her off-guard: “This was alarming to me because if the basis of the food web changes, then . . . everything could change, right?” Alin’s frank discussion of the looming oceanic apocalypse is perhaps a product of studying unfathomable change every day. But four years ago, the birth of her twins “heightened the whole issue,” she says. “I was worried enough about these problems before having kids that I maybe wondered whether it was a good idea. Now, it just makes me feel crushed.” Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist and evangelical Christian, moved from Canada to Texas with her husband, a pastor, precisely because of its vulnerability to climate change. There, she engages with the evangelical community on science — almost as a missionary would. But she’s already planning her exit strategy: “If we continue on our current pathway, Canada will be home for us long term. But the majority of people don’t have an exit strategy. . . . So that’s who I’m here trying to help.” James Hansen, the dean of climate scientists, retired from NASA in 2013 to become a climate activist. But for all the gloom of the report he just put his name to, Hansen is actually somewhat hopeful. That’s because he knows that climate change has a straightforward solution: End fossil-fuel use as quickly as possible. If tomorrow, the leaders of the United States and China would agree to a sufficiently strong, coordinated carbon tax that’s also applied to imports, the rest of the world would have no choice but to sign up. This idea has already been pitched to Congress several times, with tepid bipartisan support. Even though a carbon tax is probably a long shot, for Hansen, even the slim possibility that bold action like this might happen is enough for him to devote the rest of his life to working to achieve it. On a conference call with reporters in July, Hansen said a potential joint U.S.-China carbon tax is more important than whatever happens at the United Nations climate talks in Paris. One group Hansen is helping is Our Children’s Trust, a legal advocacy organization that’s filed a number of novel challenges on behalf of minors under the idea that climate change is a violation of intergenerational equity — children, the group argues, are lawfully entitled to inherit a healthy planet. A separate challenge to U.S. law is being brought by a former EPA scientist arguing that carbon dioxide isn’t just a pollutant (which, under the Clean Air Act, can dissipate on its own), it’s also a toxic substance. In general, these substances have exceptionally long life spans in the environment, cause an unreasonable risk, and therefore require remediation. In this case, remediation may involve planting vast numbers of trees or restoring wetlands to bury excess carbon underground. Even if these novel challenges succeed, it will take years before a bend in the curve is noticeable. But maybe that’s enough. When all feels lost, saving a few species will feel like a triumph. Odds are good that the worst wildfire disaster in U.S. history might not happen in the West – but in New Jersey. Find out why."
208,208,other,"A report in the British Medical Journal illustrates how a woman has beaten blood cancer with the help of turmeric. In 2007, 67-year-old Dieneke Ferguson was diagnosed with myeloma and she progressed to stage three within 15 months. Three failed rounds of chemotherapy and four failed stem cell transplants later, doctors told her she had very little hope. She told the U.K.’s Daily Mail: “I have been on all sorts of toxic drugs and the side-effects were terrifying.” She once lost her memory for three days, and two vertebrae in her spine collapsed and had to be injected with a type of concrete for stability. Four years after her initial diagnosis, she took matters into her own hands and started taking a daily dose of curcumin, the key component of turmeric. She took eight grams every evening on an empty stomach. Since then, her cancer has stabilized and her blood counts have returned to normal. She has also enjoyed a good quality of life. When she told her oncologist she was taking turmeric, she reports that he was very interested after seeing what a big difference it made. Myeloma is the second most common type of blood cancer, and it begins in plasma cells in the bone marrow. When these cells become abnormal and begin to multiply, it becomes myeloma and causes severe pain, nerve damage, fatigue and bone damage. Treatment is generally geared toward controlling its symptoms because there is no cure, and people typically don’t live beyond five years of being diagnosed. The BMJ report says that Ferguson’s results suggest that turmeric could be used to help myeloma patients in the future, adding: “The fact that our patient, who had advanced stage disease and was effectively salvaged while exclusively on curcumin, suggests a potential antimyeloma effect of curcumin.” No other possible explanation for her recovery The report’s co-author, Jamie Cavenagh, said that there is no other possible explanation for her remarkable recovery beyond the curcumin. She continues to take the tablets to this day. The scientists are recommending further evaluation in clinical trials to pursue the possibility of using it as an official treatment. This could prove difficult, however, because doctors cannot prescribe it until it has been tested in wide-scale trials that cost millions. Natural compounds cannot be patented, so finding an investor would be extremely difficult. Turmeric benefits a wide range of ailments Turmeric is a perennial herb that contains the natural antioxidant polyphenol curcumin, which also has analgesic properties. It has been shown to inhibit the growth of myelomaand several other types of tumor cells. Some of the other illnesses that can benefit from curcumin include infections, dementia, depression and heart disease. A 2016 review in the Journal of Medicinal Food highlighted its potential for arthritis treatment, and doctors have also applauded its anti-inflammatory effects. A recent study found that it can help destroy neuroblastoma tumor cells, showing promise as a way to treat the most common type of cancer in infants. Another study is expected to be published soon showing its positive effects on bowel cancer. Although Ferguson said she took turmeric on an empty stomach, it is usually recommended that people take it with a fat or oil to help boost its absorption because it is a fat-soluble compound. Many people enjoy turmeric with yogurt or warm milk. In addition, studies have shown that taking it with black pepper boosts absorption significantly; many supplements also contain a small amount of black pepper for this reason. It’s wonderful to hear that people are successfully treating problems that doctors cannot conquer using nothing more than what nature has provided us. Not everyone will have the same success that Ferguson did, but the fact that natural solutions can help people turn around “hopeless” situations deserves further exploration, profit possibilities or not. Sadly, it seems like this virus can’t leave our year 2020 as another one was found in China. According to reports, this was called as the Novel Bunya V!rus that is caused by ticks. People who are infected with this were diagnosed to have Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS). Experts said that this could also be transmitted from human to human. Based on previous cases, the transmission can hapoen from an infected animals or people through blood, respiratory tract and wounds.The expert who has been handling this cases said that the person who was infected three years ago, passed away and had affected 16 more people. Because of this, all the medical staffs and family members of the patient’s family must take an extra precaution about the infection. He also told everyone to avoid jungles and bushes. On the other hand, ticks don’t fly so it wouldn’t spread that fast. Actually, they rapidly breed in summer but there is still no medicine or vaccine for this. The expert is only considering this as an epidemic in the province of China where patients were diagnosed with this sickness."
209,209,other,"NASA admits that climate change occurs because of changes in Earth’s solar orbit, and NOT because of SUVs and fossil fuels Global Hot Air: Here's a United Nations climate report that environmentalists probably don't want anybody to read. It says that even if every country abides by the grand promises they made last year in Paris to reduce greenhouse gases, the planet would still be ""doomed."" X When President Obama hitched America to the Paris accords in 2016, he declared that it was ""the moment that we finally decided to save our planet."" And when Trump pulled out of the deal this year, he was berated by legions of environmentalists for killing it. But it turns out that the Paris accord was little more than a sham that will do nothing to ""save the planet."" According to the latest annual UN report on the ""emissions gap,"" the Paris agreement will provide only a third of the cuts in greenhouse gas that environmentalists claim is needed to prevent catastrophic warming. If every country involved in those accords abides by their pledges between now and 2030 — which is a dubious proposition — temperatures will still rise by 3 degrees Celsius by 2100. The goal of the Paris agreement was to keep the global temperature increase to under 2 degrees. Eric Solheim, head of the U.N. Environment Program, which produces the annual report, said this week that ""One year after the Paris Agreement entered into force, we still find ourselves in a situation where we are not doing nearly enough to save hundreds of millions of people from a miserable future. Governments, the private sector and civil society must bridge this catastrophic climate gap."" The report says unless global greenhouse gas emissions peak before 2020, the CO2 levels will be way above the goal set for 2030, which, it goes on, will make it ""extremely unlikely that the goal of holding global warming to well below 2 degrees C can still be reached."" Not to worry. The UN claims that closing this gap will be easy enough, if nations set their collective minds to it. But this is a fantasy. The list of what would need to be done by 2020 — a little over two years from now — includes: Boosting renewable energy's share to 30%. Pushing electric cars to 15% of new car sales, up from less than 1% today. Doubling mass transit use. Cutting air travel CO2 emissions by 20%. And coming up with $1 trillion for ""climate action."" Oh, and coal-fired power plants would have to be phased out worldwide, starting now. According to the report, ""phasing out coal consumption … is an indispensable condition for achieving international climate change targets."" That means putting a halt to any new coal plants while starting to phase out the ones currently in use. Good luck with that. There are currently 273 gigawatts of coal capacity under construction around the world, and another 570 gigawatts in the pipeline, the UN says. That would represent a 42% increase in global energy production from coal. Does anyone really think developing countries who need coal as a cheap source of fuel to grow their economies will suddenly call it quits? So, does this mean the planet is doomed? Hardly. As we have noted in this space many times, all those forecasts of global catastrophe are based on computer models that have been unreliable predictors of warming. And all of the horror stories assume the worst. What the report does make clear, however, is that all the posturing by government leaders in Paris was just that. Posturing. None of these countries intended to take the drastic and economically catastrophic steps environmentalist claim are needed to prevent a climate change doomsday. As such, Trump was right to stop pretending. Whether you believe in climate change or not, the Paris climate accord amounted to nothing, or pretty close to it. Even the UN admits that now.

210,210,other," According to NOAA’s own historical data, of the 50 U.S. state all-time record high temperatures, 23 were set during the 1930s, while 36 occurred prior to 1960 — climate change proponents are feeding us a fairy tale, and I’m sick of it… The maniacal sociopaths of the world may have won control of the narrative, but they seemingly have little sway over the will of the people. You need only browse the comment section below any “climate change” article or social media post to see the wave of folks resoundingly rejecting the scam-of-a-world-view assembled before them (one of the few positives of SM). The man-made global warming rejection is likely down to two things: the first being that the so called “scientific consensus” has been failing for far too long — you can’t start warning people in the 1980s that we have 10 years left to save the planet, only to keep repeating that prophecy for the next 4 decades. This is probably the reason our youth have become the new target — kids don’t have this history of failure to draw-upon when browsing the bullet points of the latest IPCC report -for example- meaning they’re far easier to manipulate. The second reason is likely the availability of climate information these days–namely historical data. Thanks to the internet, researching past climate catastrophes and comparing them to what’s happening today is a simple task. I’m talking about raw historical data, such as the number of deaths caused by a certain natural disaster, or the year and decade of the highest U.S. state temperature records: The raw data ALWAYS speaks for itself — out of the 50 U.S. state record high temperatures, 23 were set during the 1930s, while 36 occurred prior to 1960. But the powers that be have constructed a rather tenacious, loud, and bullish narrative–as on top of the world burning to a crisp, the story also warns that droughts and floods are becoming more extreme. Comfortably crushing that assertion, however, is another NOAA nugget named the Palmer Drought Index — a century+ dataset plotting the portion of the continental U.S. that is either very wet or very dry. What the index reveals is that there is no significant trend of increasing drought or flood: An uptick in hurricanes is another li(n)e we’re fed, it’s actually listed as one of the main results of human-caused global warming. But again, there is no dataset out there that supports either an increase or an intensification of severe storms. In fact, quite the opposite is true, with 9 of the 13 strongest hurricanes to make U.S. landfall occurring prior to 1965. NOAA data shows both the number of hurricanes and the number of “strong” hurricanes making U.S. landfall declining since 1900. NOAA data also reveals that the number of strong tornadoes has been declining since the 1970s. When folks are permitted to look at climate data prior to 1980, natural cycles ALWAYS reveal themselves. There are ups & there are downs, and there are ups & downs within the ups & downs — and not a single scientist on the planet fully understands the mechanisms involved, no matter what you’re told. Saying that, however, sensible and tested “guesswork” is the basis of science. Recognizing the climate works in cycles means certain things can be predicted — the Grand Solar Minimum is one such cycle. Warmth is good for life on Earth, for biodiversity — the peaks of past human civilizations have ALWAYS coincided with Grand Solar Maximums (Minoans & Romans, for example), while their downfalls have ALWAYS been marked by Minimums and the coinciding temperature drops low solar activity brings. We humans should only ever be concerned with the COLD. If only man-made global warming was real… but as with ALL OTHER fairy tales to have ever done the rounds, these fabricated worries are put in place to control you, to have you lose sleep over something you can’t quite understand, and to have you pay, in one way or another, for your sins… Social Media channels are restricting Electroverse’s reach — be sure to subscribe to receive new post notifications by email (the box is located in the sidebar >>> or scroll down if on mobile).

Terry Joe Wilson, 37, was arrested late Tuesday night after a warrant was issued for his arrest last week, The Idaho Statesman reported. Wilson has identified himself online as an associate professor at Boise State University and has been described by the press as the Boise Black Lives Matter chapter spokesman. Both physical and electronic evidence were reportedly used to identify suspects in the vandalism incident, which occurred in February. “[T]he bronze statue of Lincoln in Julia Davis Park — known as ‘Seated Lincoln’ — vandalized with feces, paint and signs,” The Idaho Statesman reported. “Parks and recreation staff were able to clean the statue, which was not permanently damaged.” The suspect fled from officers when he was first approached for his arrest, the Boise Police Department said. When he was tracked down, Wilson was found in possession of a firearm, marijuana, and drug paraphernalia. “Officers chased after Wilson and were able to stop him and take him into custody, at which time Wilson was found to be in possession of a firearm, marijuana and drug paraphernalia,” said a press release from the department. “Wilson was taken to the hospital and was medically cleared before being booked into the Ada County Jail.” “Wilson was charged with several misdemeanor counts, including injuring monuments, ornaments and public improvements, resisting and obstructing officers, possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia,” The Idaho Statesman reported. An account for Wilson describes himself as an associate professor at Boise State University.On Wilson’s Instagram page, one captioned photo from November railing against “fascist Donald Tump and neoliberal Joe Biden” identifies himself as “a student & faculty” at the university. The post, which also includes support for Black Lives Matter, reads as follows: Like the fascist @realdonaldtrump, the neoliberal @joebiden wants to increase police funding despite decades of research to support the position that police do not prevent crime. In-fact policing perpetuates crime & criminality with the support of the courts and corrections. As a student & faculty, I take matters on campus very seriously, not only for the safety of our students, but staff and faculty. The discussion around contemporary policing needs endless improvement, b/c the decision not to impeach current ASBSU President over concerns of anti-blackness under the guise of public safety is an absolute travesty.

The outlines had red smears over where the hearts would be.” The report added: “Terry Wilson II, the spokesperson for the Boise chapter, said in a phone call the demonstration at Clegg’s home was because she was one of the four council members who voted to approve Mayor Lauren McLean’s 2021 budget. The 2021 budget allocates more money for the Boise Police Department, even though the overall budget decreased from 2020. … Wilson said the chapter wanted to hold Clegg accountable for her vote, which he called ‘bad policy.'” More arrests in connection to the vandalism incident are expected to be forthcoming."

According to the reports, the girl was taken to the hospital after she complained about stomach pains, couldn’t eat, and had been constipated for five days. The doctor performed a CT scan and reportedly found “unusual spherical shadows,” AKA undigested boba, dotting her colon all the way down her digestive system. According to EBC Dongsen News, the patient reluctantly admitted she had drank a bubble tea five days earlier; however, the doctor who treated her said it would have taken a lot more boba to get to this point. The doctor prescribed laxatives for the girl to get the undigested pearls out of her system. As EBC Dongsen News reports, the director of Zhuji People’s Hospital’s emergency department said that boba, being made of tapioca starch, are already difficult to digest, but some makers also use thickeners and preservatives, the significant consumption of which may lead to gastrointestinal problems.

One senior Labour figure – a veteran of Tony Blair's Downing Street administration with strong links to Washington – claimed to The Mail on Sunday that Ms Markle, 39, was networking among senior Democrats with a view to building a campaign and fundraising teams for a tilt at the US Presidency. Last night, a source close to the Duchess of Sussex declined to comment, but the couple have made little secret of their political beliefs. One senior Labour figure claimed that Meghan Markle (pictured last year), 39, was networking among senior Democrats with a view to building a campaign and fundraising teams for a tilt at the US Presidency During the US election last year they levelled a thinly veiled attack on Donald Trump by urging voters to 'reject hate speech', which a spokesperson for the couple described as 'a call for decency'. Trump himself declared that he was 'not a fan' of Meghan, 39. A source said: 'The Blairite, internationalist and Democratic party networks are buzzing with talk about Meghan's political ambitions and potential backers.' Last year, a friend of the Duchess told Vanity Fair magazine that one of the reasons she did not give up her American citizenship when she married into the Royal Family was to allow her to keep open the option of entering Washington politics. US constitutional experts responded that she would have to renounce her title if she wanted to hold public office in the States, because it would cut across the US oath of allegiance. Buckingham Palace tried to distance the Royal Family from the remarks made during the US election by issuing a statement saying that 'the Duke is not a working member of the Royal Family' and describing his comments as 'made in a personal capacity'. The source added that the presumption was that the Duchess was eyeing 2024, when President Joe Biden will be 82 and deciding whether he wants to run for a second term.

215,215,other,"A 62% Top Tax Rate? It was an accurate and judicious answer, so naturally it sent climate alarmists into paroxysms of condemnation. The Washington Post slammed Pruitt as a “denier” driven by “unreason.” Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii called Pruitt’s views “extreme” and “irresponsible” — proof of his unfitness to head the EPA. Gina McCarthy, who ran the agency under President Obama, bewailed the danger global warming poses “to all of us who call Earth home,” and said she couldn’t “imagine what additional information [Pruitt] might want from scientists” in order to understand that. Replied Pruitt: “No. I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact. So no — I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. But we don’t know that yet. We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis.” ‘Do you believe,” CNBC’s Joe Kernen asked Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency’s new director, in an interview last Thursday, “that it’s been proven that CO2 is the primary control knob for climate?” Yet for all the hyperventilating, Pruitt’s answer to the question he was asked — whether carbon dioxide is the climate’s “primary control knob” — was entirely sound. “We don’t know that yet,” he said. We don’t. CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases. By contrast, carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere: about 400 ppm (parts per million), or 0.04 percent. Moreover, its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm. Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red. A second coat of paint has much less of an effect, while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all. Advertisement There is a popular theory that atmospheric CO2 amplifies the creation of water vapor, thereby increasing warming through a “positive feedback loop.” But that theory so far is mostly speculative; climate projections using models based on it have consistently failed, nearly always predicting far more warming than has occurred. It should go without saying that if scientists cannot yet make accurate predictions about future climate change, then their understanding of climate science remains highly incomplete. Advertisement Earth’s climate system is unfathomably complex. It is affected by innumerable interacting variables, atmospheric CO2 levels being just one. The more variables there are in any system or train of events, the lower the probability of all of them coming to pass. Your odds of correctly guessing the outcome of a flipped coin are 1 in 2, but your odds of guessing correctly twice in a row are only 1 in 4 — i.e., ½ x ½ Extending your winning streak to a third guess is even less probable: just 1 in 8. Apply that approach to climate change, and it becomes clear why the best response to the alarmists’ frantic predictions is a healthy skepticism. The list of variables that shape climate includes cloud formation, topography, altitude, proximity to the equator, plate tectonics, sunspot cycles, volcanic activity, expansion or contraction of sea ice, conversion of land to agriculture, deforestation, reforestation, direction of winds, soil quality, El Niño and La Niña ocean cycles, prevalence of aerosols (airborne soot, dust, and salt) — and, of course, atmospheric greenhouse gases, both natural and manmade. A comprehensive list would run to hundreds, if not thousands, of elements, none of which scientists would claim to understand with absolute precision. Advertisement But for the sake of argument, say there are merely 15 variables involved in predicting global climate change, and assume that climatologists have mastered each one to a near-perfect accuracy of 95 percent. What are the odds that a climate model built on a system that simple would be reliable? Less than 50/50. (Multiplying .95 by itself 15 times yields 46.3 percent.) Is it any surprise that climate-change predictions in the real world — where the complexities are exponentially greater and the exactitude of knowledge much less — have such a poor track record? Pruitt got it right: Measuring human impacts on climate is indeed “very challenging.” The science is far from settled. That is why calls to radically reduce carbon emissions are so irresponsible — and why dire warnings of what will happen if we don’t are little better than reckless fearmongering."
216,216,other,"Zakharova Says New Salisbury Claims Aim to Distract Public From the Incident Climate crisis and logging is leading to shift from canopy rainforest to open grassland. Climate crisis and logging is leading to shift from canopy rainforest to open grassland. Much of the Amazon could be on the verge of losing its distinct nature and switching from a closed canopy rainforest to an open savannah with far fewer trees as a result of the climate crisis, researchers have warned. Rainforests are highly sensitive to changes in rainfall and moisture levels, and fires and prolonged droughts can result in areas losing trees and shifting to a savannah-like mix of woodland and grassland. In the Amazon, such changes were known to be possible but thought to be many decades away. New research shows that this tipping point could be much closer than previously thought. As much as 40% of the existing Amazon rainforest is now at a point where it could exist as a savannah instead of as rainforest, according to a study published in the journal Nature Communications. Any shift from rainforest to savannah would still take decades to take full effect, but once under way the process is hard to reverse. Rainforests support a vastly greater range of species than savannah and play a much greater role in absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Parts of the Amazon are receiving much less rain than they used to because of the changing climate. Rainfall in about 40% of the forest is now at a level where the rainforest could be expected to exist as savannah instead, according to the study, led by the Stockholm Resilience Centre, based on computer models and data analysis.
Last year, Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, was warned that the continued destruction of the Amazon by fire and loggers would bring the region closer to a tipping point where rainforest could turn to savannah. This year’s fires in the Amazon are the worst in a decade, with a 60% increase in fire hotspots compared with last year. Arie Staal, lead author of the study, said the ecology of rainforests meant that although they effectively produce their own self-sustaining rainfall in the right climate, they are also prone to drying out in the wrong conditions. “As forests grow and spread across a region, this affects rainfall,” he explained. “Forests create their own rain because leaves give off water vapour and this falls as rain further downwind. Rainfall means fewer fires leading to even more forests.” But if large areas of rainforest are lost, rainfall levels in the region decline accordingly. This reduced level of “atmospheric moisture recycling” was simulated in the computer models used in the study. “Drier conditions make it harder for the forest to recover and increase the flammability of the ecosystem,” Staal told the Guardian. Once rainforest has crossed the threshold and converted to an open savannah-type mix of wood and grassland, it is unlikely to revert naturally to its former state. “It is harder to return from the ‘trap’ caused by the feedback mechanism in which the open, grassy ecosystem is more flammable, and the fires, in turn, keep the ecosystem open,” he said.

Source: Staal et al, Nature Communications, Obbe Tuinenburg The team of researchers ran computer simulations of where forests might be expected to exist across the earth’s tropical regions, given certain climatic conditions, and looked at the minimum and maximum areas of likely forest cover. They also looked at what was likely to happen if greenhouse gas emissions kept rising, and found that the ability of forests to grow back once trees were lost would be much reduced. Ingo Fetzer of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, co-author of the paper, said: “We understand now that rainforests on all continents are very sensitive to global change and can rapidly lose their ability to adapt. Once gone, their recovery will take many decades to return to their original state. And given that rainforests host the majority of all global species, all this will be forever lost.”"

The longtime friends knew that they could soon be running against each other for president. The two agreed that if they ultimately faced each other as presidential candidates, they should remain civil and avoid attacking one another, so as not to hurt the progressive movement. They also discussed how to best take on President Donald Trump, and Warren laid out two main reasons she believed she would be a strong candidate: She could make a robust argument about the economy and earn broad support from female voters. Sanders responded that he did not believe a woman could win. The description of that meeting is based on the accounts of four people: two people Warren spoke with directly soon after the encounter, and two people familiar with the meeting. After publication of this story, Warren herself backed up this account of the meeting, saying in part in a statement Monday, ""I thought a woman could win; he disagreed."" That evening in 2018, Sanders expressed frustration at what he saw as a growing focus among Democrats on identity politics, according to one of the people familiar with the conversation. Warren told Sanders she disagreed with his assessment that a woman could not win, three of the four sources said. Sanders denied the characterization of the meeting in a statement to CNN. ""It is ludicrous to believe that at the same meeting where Elizabeth Warren told me she was going to run for president, I would tell her that a woman couldn't win,"" Sanders said. ""It's sad that, three weeks before the Iowa caucus and a year after that private conversation, staff who weren't in the room are lying about what happened. What I did say that night was that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could. Do I believe a woman can win in 2020? Of course! After all, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 3 million votes in 2016."" Warren's communications director Kristen Orthman declined to comment. These previously unreported details from the two senators' private meeting shed new light on the careful efforts that Warren and Sanders appear to have made to manage their friendship and political rivalry even before the 2020 race was officially underway. From the start, even as both candidates were determined to capture the Democratic nomination, they were also keenly sensitive to the risk that their rivalry could divide the progressive movement. The conversation also illustrates the skepticism among not only American voters but also senior Democratic officials that the country is ready to elect a woman as president, several years after one clinched a major political party's nomination for president for the first time. Many Democrats believe sexism played a role in Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 general election, and voters say they are torn about whether to try again to put a woman in the White House in 2020. The revelation that Sanders expressed skepticism that Warren could win the presidency because she is a woman is particularly noteworthy now, given that Warren is the lone female candidate at the top of the Democratic field. And notably, their meeting in December 2018 came just weeks after a record number of women had been elected to the House of Representatives, helping to deliver the majority to the Democrats. Democrats have been intensely debating questions of identity and representation in recent years, and the party's historically diverse field of White House candidates this cycle has featured multiple women. Sanders himself weighed in shortly after the 2016 election, saying that ""one of the struggles that you're going to be seeing in the Democratic Party is whether we go beyond identity politics."" ""I think it's a step forward in America if you have an African American CEO of some major corporation. But you know what, if that guy is going to be shipping jobs out of this country, and exploiting his workers, it doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot whether he's black or white or Latino,"" he said at an appearance in Boston to promote his book, according to WBUR ""Name your favorite woman president"" Warren has grown increasingly vocal over the past few months on the role of sexism and gender inequality in politics, including experiences the Massachusetts Democrat said she has endured in the years that she has been in public office. On the campaign trail, Warren tells voters the story of how some male colleagues have advised her to ""smile more"" and being discouraged from running for Senate in 2012 because she was a woman. ""Over and over, we are told that women are not allowed to be angry. It makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet,"" Warren wrote in a campaign email in November, with the subject line: ""I am angry and I own it."" Three weeks ahead of the Iowa caucuses, Warren is now the only woman polling in the double-digits nationally. A new CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll showed Warren in a four-way race in Iowa, along with Sanders, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden. In that survey, Sanders and Warren performed nearly equally well as the top choice among female likely Democratic caucusgoers, while Sanders and Buttigieg were the top choice among men. Last month, Warren said in Las Vegas that she had ""lived enough of my life with men, and it's mostly been men, telling me to sit down and be quiet."" Days later, she acknowledged that this was a dynamic she had experienced in the current campaign. Warren's rivals have also grappled with the issue of sexism in politics. Biden recently said on the campaign trail that Clinton had confronted ""unfair"" sexist attacks in the last election, and added: ""That's not going to happen with me."" Sen. Amy Klobuchar said recently that female candidates with as little political experience as Buttigieg would not have qualified for the presidential debate. ""Women are held to a higher standard,"" the Minnesota Democrat said. ""Otherwise we could play a game called 'Name Your Favorite Woman President,' which we can't do because it has all been men."" A fraying non-aggression pact The New York Times first reported over a year ago that Warren and Sanders met in Washington in December 2018. That initial report said that neither senator sought each other's support, and that they did not try to dissuade one another from running in the 2020 election. If Warren and Sanders agreed on a non-aggression pact of sorts that night, that agreement has become increasingly frayed. Over the last year, Sanders aides and advisers have taken to social media to criticize Warren on numerous issues, including ""Medicare for All,"" student loan debt cancelation and the ""wealth tax."" Some of his allies have also implicitly and explicitly gone after Warren on the broader question of who has the rightful claim to the progressive mantle in 2020. ""People have to decide do they want originals or do they want copies,"" Nina Turner, Sanders' campaign co-chair, told CNN over the summer. ""He's the original."" Politico reported over the weekend on the Sanders campaign's talking points instructing volunteers to say that Warren's supporters are ""highly-educated, more affluent people who are going to show up and vote Democratic no matter what"" and that ""she's bringing no new bases into the Democratic Party."" Campaigning in Marshalltown, Iowa, Warren told reporters that she was ""disappointed to hear that Bernie is sending his volunteers out to trash me."" ""Bernie knows me, and has known me for a long time,"" Warren said. ""He knows who I am, where I come from, what I have worked on and fought for, and the coalition and grassroots movement we're trying to build."" Sanders himself appeared to distance himself from the memo, saying on Sunday that his campaign has ""hundreds of employees"" and that ""people sometimes say things that they shouldn't."" ""I have never said a negative word about Elizabeth Warren, who is a friend of mine,"" Sanders said. UPDATE: This story has been updated with Warren's statement after publication backing up sources' accounts."

Also on the naughty list were Christmas carols, Christmas music, and making Christmas ornaments as gifts. Liberty Counsel — a law firm focused on religious freedom — caught wind of a Nebraska elementary school principal who banned a long list of Christmas-related items, among them candy canes because the ""J"" shape stands ""for Jesus."" Liberty Counsel — a law firm focused on religious freedom — caught wind of a Nebraska elementary school principal who banned a long list of Christmas-related items. Special: What kinds of items, you ask? Liberty Counsel provided a memo from principal Jennifer Sinclair that spelled out in detail all the verboten paraphernalia at Manchester Elementary School in Omaha: Santas or Christmas items (clip art) on worksheets Christmas trees in classrooms Elf on the Shelf — that's Christmas-related Singing Christmas carols Playing Christmas music Sending a Scholastic book that is a Christmas book — that's Christmas-related Making a Christmas ornament as a gift —This assumes that the family has a Christmas tree which assumes they celebrate Christmas. I challenge the thought of, ""Well they can just hang it somewhere else."" Candy Cane — that's Christmas-related. Historically, the shape is a ""J"" for Jesus. The red is for the blood of Christ, and the white is a symbol of his resurrection. This would also include different colored candy canes.

Howard Santa Claus School workshop on Oct. 17, 2008, in Midland, Michigan. What was the principal's reasoning? Sinclair — who's in her first year as Manchester's principal — noted in the memo that she ""come[s] from a place that Christmas and the like are not allowed in schools"" and that ""as a public school"" Manchester Elementary will be seek to be ""inclusive and culturally sensitive to all of our students."" ""I have unknowingly awoken a 'sleeping giant' with many of you,"" she added. ""I apologize for the stress that 'Christmas/holiday/ Grinch/Santa/tree' emails and conversations have caused you.""

""I'm hopeful we can avoid the discomfort of me directly questioning something you've copied, posted and had your kids do. That makes me uncomfortable, and I know it doesn't feel good."" She signed the memo, ""The (Unintentional) Grinch who stole Christmas (from Manchester)."" What happened next? Liberty Counsel sent a demand letter to the superintendent of Elkhorn Public Schools about the Christmas ban, urging it to ""immediately overrule and specifically disavow the sweeping directive banning Christmas holiday items, and require Principal Sinclair to undertake review of District policy and the law."" How did the district respond? Believe it or not, the district's response to Liberty Counsel said it had ""investigated this matter and determined that Principal Sinclair's memorandum did not comply with Board Policy"" and that Manchester staffers were advised that ""certain Christmas symbols"" are permissible. What did Liberty Counsel have to say? ""We are pleased that Elkhorn Public Schools promptly reversed Principal Jennifer Sinclair's unconstitutional directive, and required compliance with the Constitution,"" Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, said in a statement. ""The First Amendment does not require elimination of Christmas. Nothing prohibits public schools from teaching objectively about Christmas or other holidays with religious significance, from displaying religious and secular Christmas symbols side-by-side or singing sacred and secular Christmas songs together. The First Amendment prohibits censorship based on religious viewpoint. This outrageous three-page memo by Principal Sinclair was not based on ignorance of the law but hatred toward Christianity and Christmas. Principal Sinclair should issue an apology to her teachers and staff."" UPDATE, 1:28 p.m. Dec. 6: A school district spokesperson told TheBlaze that Sinclair issued an apology. The spokesperson also noted the district's statement on the matter: ""Elkhorn Public Schools District administration promptly addressed the issue at Manchester Elementary School regarding the memo that was sent by the principal to Manchester elementary staff. The memo does not reflect the policy of Elkhorn Public Schools regarding holiday symbols in the school. The District has since clarified expectations and provided further direction to staff in alignment with District policy. This issue was limited to Manchester Elementary School and did not arise at any other schools within the District."""

223,223,other,"Clog the lines': Internet trolls deliberately disrupted the Iowa caucuses hotline for reporting results The phone number to report Iowa caucus results was posted on a fringe internet message board on Monday night along with encouragement to “clog the lines,” an indication that jammed phone lines that left some caucus managers on hold for hours may have in part been due to prank calls. An Iowa Democratic Party official said the influx of calls to the reporting hotline included “supporters of President Trump who called to express their displeasure with the Democratic Party.” The party official’s comments were first reported late Wednesday by Bloomberg News. Users on a politics-focused section of the fringe 4chan message board repeatedly posted the phone number for the Iowa Democratic Party, which was found by a simple Google search, both as screenshots and in plain text, alongside instructions. ""They have to call in the results now. Very long hold times being reported. Phone line being clogged,"" one user posted at about 11 p.m. ET on Monday, three hours after the caucuses began. ""Uh oh how unfortunate it would be for a bunch of mischief makers to start clogging the lines,"" responded another anonymous user, sarcastically. Some users chimed in, posting alleged wait times on hold, imploring others to “clog the lines [and] make the call lads.” Rob Sand, state auditor of Iowa, said he took results calls on Monday night as a volunteer and received an influx of calls that appeared to have been generated by a post on the internet. “A lot of calls came in at a certain point where it was clear somebody had published the hotline number somewhere,” Sand said. He cautioned that he could not speak for other people who were taking calls and said he did not get any calls that said they were from Trump supporters. He added that the system prevented people from reporting fake results. He also said he was able to identify fake calls quickly. “If I picked up the phone and it was clear after the first handful of words that someone was not calling to report the results, I just hung up,” Sand said. Mandy McClure, communications director for the Iowa Democratic Party, confirmed that the hotline received “an unusually high volume of inbound phone calls to its caucus hotline, including supporters of President Trump.” “The unexplained, and at times hostile, calls contributed to the delay in the Iowa Democratic Party’s collection of results, but in no way affected the integrity of information gathered or the accuracy of data sets reported,” McClure said in a statement. The telephone reporting problems added to other issues, notably a smartphone app that did not work for some people and that also had a coding problem that prevented results from being reported properly, pushing more caucus volunteers to the phone lines. Iowa Democratic Party officials said that party staff members and volunteers flagged and subsequently blocked repeat callers who appeared to be reaching out in an attempt to interfere with their reporting duties. These included callers who would hang up immediately after being connected and callers who expressed support for Trump and displeasure with the Democratic Party. It’s unclear how many prank calls the party received or how much they contributed to wait times. Some calls came from Iowans looking to confirm details of their evening’s caucus, party officials said. The party has not responded to requests for information on how many individuals were manning the phone lines on Monday night. The Trump campaign denied any affiliation with people clogging phone lines on Monday night. “We don’t know anything about this, but perhaps Democrats should consider using an app that works,"" communications director Tim Murtaugh said. ""It's laughable that they would try to blame Trump for their own incompetence."" Several officials at caucuses attended by NBC News reporters struggled with lengthy hold times that made it impossible for them to report results. 4chan, which hosts an anonymous and often extremist politics board called /pol/ whose users have largely supported Trump since 2015, is known for extensive online political trolling and targeted harassment campaigns. On debate nights, 4chan users often direct one another to swarm and manipulate specific online polls on other websites with repeat votes, a practice known as “brigading” in online communities. The polls would then be used by politicians and partisan websites to claim shocking upsets. Users on 4chan are anonymous, and usernames are randomly generated with each new thread. Some users on 4chan pushed back against users claiming to spam phone lines on Monday night. One user said he didn’t want other trolls “making us the scapegoat for the DNC.” “I can’t wait for the news headlines saying nefarious trolls ruined the caucus,” another added. Two precinct chairs said they were unaware of any interference with the hotline and doubted it made much of an impact. “I wouldn’t blame the Republicans,” said Tom Courtney, co-chair of the Des Moines County Democratic Party and a precinct chair. “I’d love to blame the Republicans and the Trumpers, but I don’t know.” Mike Carberry, chair for a precinct in Iowa City, also said he doubted prank calls were the primary reason for long wait times. “I’m sure that they got some calls, but those could be sorted through relatively quickly,” he said. Another hotline staffer who asked to remain anonymous said they were aware of the prank calls but that they were not the main reason that results were delayed. “It was definitely a problem,” the staffer said. “But it was definitely not the reason that results were a mess.”"
224,224,other,"Renationalising railways supported by almost two thirds of Britons, exclusive poll reveals Diabetes prescriptions are costing the NHS in England more than £1 billion a year, according to figures from NHS Digital. The total cost of the prescriptions has risen significantly - by more than £422 million - in the last 10 years. Almost one in 20 prescriptions written by GPs are now for diabetes treatment. The biggest increases are seen in treatments for type 2 diabetes, which affects around 90% of diabetes patients. Robin Hewings, head of policy at the charity Diabetes UK, said the figures reflect a dramatic rise in the incidence of diabetes. The number of people diagnosed with diabetes has doubled in the last 20 years, and it is responsible for 26,000 early deaths per year alongside serious complications such as blindness, amputation or stroke. This data shows that diabetes prescribing costs £1bn, but it is estimated that the total cost to the NHS is over £10bn a year, so the real price we have to pay for diabetes is not medications, but the devastating and expensive complications. Mr Hewings pointed out that drug costs have not risen significantly during this period, and that the increase in prescribing costs is largely a result of the rise in prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes signs 'detectable years earlier' 'Postcode lottery' for diabetes monitors Diabetes 'info prescription' plan Presentational grey line The rise in diabetes There are now over three million people in England with a diagnosis of diabetes. The number has doubled over the last two decades and there are nearly 100,000 diagnoses per year. 92% of recorded diagnoses of diabetes relate to type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes, unlike type 1, is closely linked to lifestyle factors and is preventable through lifestyle change. Almost seven out of 10 men are overweight or obese 66.8% and almost six out of 10 women are overweight or obese 57.8% in England. Source: NHS England Presentational grey line Type 2 diabetes is caused by the body not producing enough insulin, or by the body's cells not reacting to the insulin that is present, resulting in high blood sugar. It may be controlled by diet, or by antidiabetic drugs or insulin, or both. Type 2 is caused by a variety of factors, some of which are out of people's control, but more than 80 percent is caused by obesity or being overweight. In overweight and obese people, type 2 diabetes can be prevented and reversed by losing weight. The NHS England figures also include the cost of devices used by people with diabetes to monitor their condition. Nearly £477 million was spent on antidiabetic drugs in 2017-18. Over the same year, around £350 million was spent on insulin, and £181 million on diagnostic and monitoring devices. Professor Jonathan Valabhji, national clinical director for diabetes and obesity at NHS England, said: Thanks to better diagnosis and treatment, the NHS is caring for more people than ever before with diabetes, and this new data highlights the urgent need to prevent type 2 diabetes from developing in the first place. The NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme has now reached over a quarter of a million people at high risk of type 2 diabetes."
225,225,other,"NHS fails thousands of new mothers with post-natal depression Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide has helped raise global food production and reduce poverty. National polls show that climate change is low on the list of voters’ priorities. For good reason: In the U.S., and for much of the world, the most dangerous environmental pollutants have been cleaned up. U.S. emissions of particulates, metals and varied gases—all of these: ozone, lead, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and sulfur—fell almost 70% between 1970 and 2014. Further reductions will come from improved technologies such as catalytic removal of oxides of nitrogen and more-efficient sulfur scrubbers. This is a boon to human health. But a myth persists that is both unscientific and immoral to perpetuate: that the beneficial gas carbon dioxide ranks among hazardous pollutants. It does not. Unlike genuine pollutants, carbon dioxide (CO2) is an odorless, colorless gas. Every human being exhales about two pounds of CO2 a day, along with a similar amount of water vapor. CO2 is nontoxic to people and animals and is a vital nutrient to plants. It is also a greenhouse gas which helps maintain earth at a habitable temperature. Fear of excessive warming from more CO2 in the atmosphere, including that released from human activity, has caused some people to advocate substantial and expensive reductions in CO2 emissions. But observations, such as those on our CO2 Coalition website, show that increased CO2 levels over the next century will cause modest and beneficial warming—perhaps as much as one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit)—and that this will be an even larger benefit to agriculture than it is now. The costs of emissions regulations, which will be paid by everyone, will be punishingly high and will provide no benefits to most people anywhere in the world."
226,226,other,"NHS Long Term Plan to tackle major killer conditions and save up to half a million lives The NHS Long Term Plan, published today, will save almost half a million more lives with practical action on major killer conditions and investment in world class, cutting edge treatments including genomic tests for every child with cancer.  The blueprint to make the NHS fit for the future will use the latest technology, such as digital GP consultations for all those who want them, coupled with early detection and a renewed focus on prevention to stop an estimated 85,000 premature deaths each year.  Measures outlined by NHS leaders today will help prevent 150,000 heart attacks, strokes and dementia cases while more than three million people will benefit from new and improved stroke, respiratory and cardiac services over the next decade.  Patients will benefit from services ranging from improved neonatal care for new parents and babies to life-changing stroke therapy and integrated support to keep older people out of hospital, living longer and more independent lives.  The NHS Long Term Plan is also the first time in the NHS’ 70 year history when there will be a new guarantee that investment in primary, community and mental health care will grow faster than the growing overall NHS budget. This will fund a £4.5 billion new service model for the 21st century across England, where health bodies come together to provide better, joined up care in partnership with local government.  The commitment to tackle major physical conditions comes alongside the biggest ever investment in mental health services rising to at least £2.3 billion a year by 2023/24. Building on significant expansion in recent years, the long term plan will see around two million more people who suffer anxiety, depression or other problems receive help over the next decade including new dads as well as mums, and 24 hour access to crisis care via NHS 111.  The NHS Long Term Plan will also:  Open a digital ‘front door’ to the health service, allowing patients to be able to access health care at the touch of a button  Provide genetic testing for a quarter of people with dangerously high inherited cholesterol, reaching around 30,000 people  Give mental health help to 345,000 more children and young people through the expansion of community based services, including in schools  Use cutting edge scans and technology, including the potential use of artificial intelligence, to help provide the best stroke care in Europe with over 100,000 more people each year accessing new, better services  Invest in earlier detection and better treatment of respiratory conditions to prevent 80,000 hospital admissions and smart inhalers will be piloted so patients can easily monitor their condition, regardless of where they are  Ensure every hospital with a major A&E department has ‘same day emergency care’ in place so that patients can be treated and discharged with the right package of support, without needing an overnight stay.  NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said: “The NHS has been marking its 70th anniversary, and the national debate has rightly centred on three big truths. There’s been pride in our health service’s enduring success, and in the shared social commitment it represents. There’s been concern – about funding, staffing, increasing inequalities and pressures from a growing and ageing population. And there’s also been legitimate optimism – about the possibilities for continuing medical advance and better outcomes of care.  “In looking ahead to the Health Service’s 80th birthday, this NHS Long Term Plan acts on all three of these realities. It keeps all that’s good about our health service and its place in our national life. It tackles head-on the pressures our staff face. And it sets a practical, costed, phased route map for the NHS’s priorities for care quality and outcomes improvement for the decade ahead.”  Seventy years after the NHS was founded, the health service will expand care for patients and their families at every stage of life, supporting people to start well, live well and age well.  The NHS will be the first health service in the world to offer whole genome sequencing for children with cancer and young people who have a rare genetic disorder, in addition to adults suffering from certain rare conditions or specific cancers.  The new, individually tailored treatments will be introduced alongside cutting edge testing services that will mean three quarters of cancer patients are diagnosed early, when the condition is easier to treat, up from half at present, saving 55,000 lives a year.  Around 23,000 premature deaths and 50,000 hospital admissions will be prevented over the next decade by putting over 100,000 patients with heart problems through a healthy living and exercise programme every year.  Children and young people’s health will be a priority with the introduction of a new transformation programme to oversee delivery of commitments for the next ten years, from bringing mental and physical care together to services for 0-25 years so that care is timely and continuous.  A renewed focus on prevention including action to help people live healthier lives will stop thousands of people developing life threatening or limiting conditions, including the expansion of the Diabetes Prevention Programme.  And as more people live longer, care will increasingly be delivered in people’s homes or somewhere convenient, freeing up space in hospitals for those who need it most.  Ian Dalton, chief executive of NHS Improvement, said: “At the heart of the NHS are hard-working staff who pull out all the stops to care for patients every day. It is thanks to their dedication that the NHS is admired around the world and that it has taken great strides over the last seven decades.  “We need to build on these achievements and make the best use of the new investment to fundamentally reset how the NHS is run so that our growing and ageing population can get the right care at the right time and in the right place.  “This means breaking down organisational barriers to take a more holistic approach to how care is delivered and paid for, embracing new and existing forms of technology, recruiting and retaining the right number of staff, and shifting the focus away from hospitals to prevention and care in the community.  “Developed by those working within the NHS, the long term plan sets out an exciting roadmap for how we will do this together for the benefit of patients.”  Professor Carrie MacEwen, chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges said: “It’s good to have a plan which sets a clear direction for the NHS and tackles many of the issues the Academy has long been saying need to be addressed if we are to improve patient care. Our challenge now is to make sure it’s properly implemented and in this regard we, that is everyone who works in the NHS and patients who use the service, must all play our part if we are to make it a success.”  Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation said: “This plan is a welcome and significant step in the fight against heart and circulatory diseases, which promises to save thousands of lives in the coming years.  “The plan’s strong focus on improving prevention and detection of heart and circulatory diseases and their risk factors has the potential to make a huge difference, ensuring that deaths rates fall further in the future. In addition, better care and support for people living with heart failure will significantly improve quality of life for many.  “It’s now essential that work gets underway on making this transformational plan a reality.”  Paul Farmer, chief executive of Mind, said: “We are really pleased to see that mental health is such a key focus in the NHS long term plan and we welcome the £2.3bn set aside for mental health services. This is the kind of sustained investment we need to see to put mental health on an equal footing with physical health and, if delivered, this plan will make a difference to the lives of thousands of people with mental health problems.  “Everyone now needs to work together to develop the workforce needed and to deliver these plans and to ensure the money reaches the frontline. Local decision makers need to develop their own plans and the proof of delivery will be in the experiences of people trying to access the services they need.”  Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan, said:  “It’s been a privilege to work with NHSE shaping the cancer section of the long term plan. I’m delighted that cancer has continued to remain a high priority. One in two people will get a cancer diagnosis during their lifetime and the plan lays out important milestones around improving survival and ensuring high quality personalised care for every patient. I look forward to continuing to work with the NHS to meet these milestones and to improve cancer care for patients now and in the future.”"
227,227,other,"NHS cuts 15,000 beds in six years Hospitals have axed 15,000 beds in just six years, leaving wards at ‘breaking point’, a shock report reveals today.  The dramatic reduction – equivalent to closing 24 hospitals – amounts to a 10 per cent fall in NHS beds at a time when the health service is under unprecedented pressure.  There are now just 129,458 hospital beds available for patients at night, down from 144,455 in 2010/11.  Critics say patients’ safety is at risk and blame the cuts on an NHS obsession with shifting care out of hospitals and ‘closer to home’.  The dramatic reduction – equivalent to closing 24 hospitals – amounts to a 10 per cent fall in NHS beds at a time when the health service is under unprecedented pressure  Health officials say patients recover more quickly if they are looked after in their own homes by GPs, district nurses and carers, but many surgeries and councils do not have the resources to care for people who would previously have stayed longer in hospital.  At the same time, demand for beds is soaring due to the pressures of a social care crisis, immigration and an ageing population, with many more patients succumbing to long-term illnesses and frailty.  New figures today will suggest the problem is likely to get worse. Regulator NHS Improvement will warn that despite being given a £1.8 billion cash injection from the Government last year, hospitals are on course for a £1 billion deficit by the end of this year.  The figures will spark a fresh debate about whether the NHS is contributing to its problems by squandering precious resources.  One report yesterday said hospitals had blown £2 billion by overpaying for items such as toilet roll, blinds and wet wipes, with items that could have been sent in one hospital’s internal mail being sent by Royal Mail instead.  The British Medical Association BMA warned that the loss of 15,000 beds ‘risked patient safety’ because nothing had been done to improve the level of care at home.  The lack of beds means hospitals are having to cancel operations at the last minute – including cancer and heart surgery – or send patients home before they have properly recovered.  Hospitals have axed 15,000 beds in just six years, leaving wards at ‘breaking point’, a shock report reveals today  The BMA report also highlights how the NHS has fewer beds per head than nearly every country in Europe  The BMA report also highlights how the NHS has fewer beds per head than nearly every country in Europe. The UK has an average of 2.4 beds per 1,000 population, compared to Germany 8, Austria 7.5 and France 6.  And it raises concerns over occupancy rates on wards. Hospitals are not meant to be more than 85 per cent occupied, but the report highlights figures showing that nine out of ten exceeded this over the winter. Several hospitals are 99 or even 100 per cent occupied with patients at much higher risk of infections and neglect.  Last week an inquest heard that grandmother Mary Muldowney, 57, from Crawley, West Sussex, died from a brain haemorrhage after three hospitals refused to admit her because they had no beds.  Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the BMA’s council, said: ‘These figures paint an even bleaker picture of an NHS that is at breaking point.  Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the BMA’s council, said: ‘These figures paint an even bleaker picture of an NHS that is at breaking point'  ‘High bed occupancy is a symptom of wider pressure and demand on an overstretched and underfunded system. It causes delays in admissions, operations being cancelled and patients being unfairly and sometimes repeatedly let down.  'The delays that vulnerable patients are facing, particularly those with mental health issues, have almost become the norm and this is unacceptable.’  The bed shortage is being exacerbated by the bed-blocking crisis, caused by the problems in the social care sector. With a shortage of home help and places at residential care homes, elderly and vulnerable patients are staying in hospital longer than they should.  Former health minister, Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb, said: ‘The situation is getting intolerable, with more cancelled operations, longer delays and those with mental health issues being systematically let down. The Government is failing to properly fund the NHS and patients are paying the price.’  Today’s figures cover all hospital beds, including those on general and maternity wards, as well as in mental health and learning disability centres. An average hospital has 634 beds, so a loss of 15,000 beds is equivalent to almost 24 hospitals.  Fiona Johnson, of the Nuffield Trust think-tank, said: ‘The extremely high level of bed occupancy in England’s hospitals creates pressure-cooker conditions for the NHS.  ‘The drive to achieve efficiencies by reducing bed numbers has become counterproductive, as there is no slack in the system to accommodate surges in demand and as a result procedures and operations get delayed.’  Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ‘The shameful reality is this overcrowding puts patients at risk and blows apart ministers’ claims to be prioritising safety.’  FAMILY DOCTORS ARE OFFERING FIVE-MINUTE APPOINTMENTS Family doctors are offering patients urgent appointments lasting only five minutes in a bid to meet soaring demand. A snapshot survey found several surgeries offering the same-day slots for anyone who thinks they need to be seen immediately. This includes parents worried about sick children or patients with chest pain or breathing difficulties. GP appointments in England usually last ten minutes and are already among the shortest in Europe. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, of the British Medical Association, said: ‘Five minutes is woefully too short. 'Nine out of ten GPs say they cannot manage in ten-minute appointments.’ Advertisement  An NHS England spokesman said: ‘Modern treatment advances such as minimally invasive surgery, fast-acting anaesthetics and medicines taken at home mean that the length of time patients spend in hospital has been falling in all Western countries.  ‘The NHS is highly efficient overall, but there are still meaningful differences in discharge practices and community support across England.’  The Department of Health said: Our hospitals are busier than ever but thanks to the hard work of staff, our performances are still among the best in the world. We have backed the NHS’s own plan for the future with an extra £10 billion by 2020.’"
228,228,other,"UK faces return to inequality of Thatcher years, says report Pressure on the government to help struggling Britons has intensified after a leading thinktank warned that falling living standards for the poor threatened the biggest rise in inequality since Margaret Thatcher was prime minister.  The Resolution Foundation said Theresa May would need to make good on her pledge to support “just about managing” households as it released a report showing that rising inflation and an end to recent strong jobs growth would hit the least well-off hardest.  Its warnings chime with other forecasts for a squeeze on family budgets on the back of sluggish wage growth, welfare cuts, rising global oil prices and the pound’s sharp fall since the Brexit vote. The drop in sterling has made imports more expensive and there are already signs that is being passed on to consumers, with inflation hitting its highest level for more than two years in December.  The Resolution Foundation’s study found that the current parliament would be the worst for living standards for the poorest half of households since comparable records began in the mid-1960s and the worst since the early years of Thatcher’s 1979-90 premiership for inequality.  Since its sharp increase in the early 1980s – a period of high unemployment, factory closures and a cut in the top rate of tax from 83% to 60% – inequality has broadly remained flat.  But the Resolution Foundation forecast that between 2015 and the next general election in 2020 incomes for the poorest half of households will fall by 2%.  That compares with a rise of 4% during the last parliament and 1% between 2005 and 2010 – the five-year period that included the deepest recession since the 1930s.    Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said: “Britain has enjoyed a welcome mini-boom in living standards in recent years. But that boom is slowing rapidly as inflation rises, productivity flatlines and employment growth slows.  “The squeeze in the wake of the financial crisis tended to hit richer households the most. But this time around it’s low- and middle-income families with kids who are set to be worst affected.  “This could leave Britain with the worst of both worlds on living standards – the weak income growth of the last parliament and rising inequality from the time Margaret Thatcher was in Downing Street.  “The prime minister’s focus on supporting just managing families is absolutely right if we are to avoid the next few years being like the 1980s without the feelgood factor.”  The prediction that inequality is set to start rising again is based on the thinktank’s forecast that while incomes will fall for the poorer half of households they will rise by about 5% for the richest fifth over the next four years.  The foundation blames the upcoming living standards squeeze on a combination of stagnating pay, rising inflation and the rollout of more than £12bn of welfare cuts. It emphasised that the pound’s weakness since the Brexit vote and other economic factors such as flat productivity growth were only part of the picture. The unequal nature of the squeeze would be the result of government policy on tax and benefits.    “The vote to leave the European Union does not, thus far, appear to have impacted on the macroeconomy or employment, but it has hastened the end of ultra-low inflation and increased how far it is likely to rise in the next few years,” the report said.  “But, in some ways regardless of the average level of household income growth, Britain is also actively choosing to increase inequality. Despite welcome policies such as the national living wage, the plans the new prime minister has inherited are likely to ensure that the proceeds of growth are shared unequally and many families made worse off.”    The thinktank sees inequality rising to record highs by 2020 on three different measures: the 90:10 income ratio, which is the income of a household 90% up the income distribution scale, divided by that of a household only 10% of the way up; on the 80:20 ratio, calculated in a similar way from those 80% up the distribution and those 20% up; and on the Palma ratio, the income share of the top 10% divided by the income share of the bottom 40%.  “All forecast measures show large increases in inequality over the next four years, with all reaching record highs by 2020-21. This is a starkly different pattern from the trend of the past 20 years, over which time inequality has been broadly flat or even declining,” the report said.    Underscoring the challenge for May’s government as it seeks to redress deep regional imbalances in the UK, the Resolution Foundation also highlighted persistent inequalities between south-east England and the rest of the country.  Incomes in the vast majority of the country were more than 10% lower than in most wealthy region, south-east England, its analysis found. North-east England and the West Midlands had the lowest levels of income, both 20% lower than in the south-east.  On the capital, the report added: “Contrary perhaps to received wisdom London is not the region with the highest income, and once housing costs are taken into account, incomes in the region are roughly 10% lower than in the south-east.”  A spokesperson for the Treasury said: “Living standards reached their highest ever level in 2015, and are forecast to be higher still by the end of the parliament.    “Millions of people are taking home more of what they earn thanks to the government’s actions to reduce income tax bills and introduce the national living wage. We are helping households with the cost of living by increasing the supply of affordable housing, banning letting agents’ fees, and freezing fuel duty, and our investment to boost productivity will raise living standards in the long run.”  John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the Resolution Foundation was damning: “Labour called on the government at the autumn statement to end the unfair cuts to in work benefits, while they were going ahead with tax giveaways to a wealthy minority, but Philip Hammond chose to carry on with the work of his predecessor.  “It is becoming clearer by the day that working families will be forced to pay for a Tory Brexit that favours the rich and not the rest of us, as our country faces its biggest rise in inequality since Margaret Thatcher.”"
229,229,other,"Strike by doctors will put 200 lives at risk, says fellow NHS medic   Doc calls for a return to negotiations By DR JONATHAN STANLEY 12th January 2016, 12:01 am Updated: 6th April 2016, 9:54 am  TODAY my colleagues are going out on strike.  It is unprecedented, threatens patients’ dignity and safety — and it is unnecessary.  For me, it’s also illegal. That’s why today, I’m calling — along with think tank the Bow Group — for the British Medical Association BMA to call off its strikes and return to negotiations to bag the settlement we all need.  Savvy tactics from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt led to the Government going in too hard in talks none of us can walk away from.  That’s why a ballot was held.  But even back in November there was no reason why the BMA couldn’t have gone to mediators Acas first before upping the ante.  No one can honestly say that doctors, or the conditions on offer, are the same as what they were when the ballot was called. For me, the strike mandate ended when Acas talks started.  READ MORE:  Corbyn’s mob in doc strike as Momentum sends lefties to join picket line  Strike by junior doctors could drag on ‘for months’, says union boss  Moet medics: High life of docs’ leaders who are heading up NHS strike  Just days before the current talks broke down we all saw BMA reps briefing the media about how badly the whole thing was going.  Union bigwigs close to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn turned up the heat and the talks, naturally, collapsed.  With little chance of Labour returning to power any time soon we are now seeing Corbyn’s “new kind of politics” — a return to direct action to undermine the Government come what may.  His friends inside my union are leveraging the trust and goodwill we’ve spent years building and are weaponising my colleagues and our patients.  There has been no attention given to the victims of recent floods, who have lost so much and had operations cancelled.  With these strikes going ahead it is nonsense to say we can diagnose and treat cancers on time or that we can continue to see those suffering with mental health problems.  And it is nonsense to say the whole profession is behind the strikes — so many grades weren’t even balloted.  There are many different voices saying how many patients may die from understaffing over weekends and over these strikes.  The research I’ve worked on with the Bow Group suggests that more than two hundred lives could be lost just over the three days of industrial action this month.  There is our human side to this debate too. Thousands of us have worked hard to get into medicine.  We see so many patients suffer from their illnesses and are privileged to be there to help them as best we can.  I’ve worked as a doctor since 2005. I see the devastation when an operation is delayed, the anguish when a cancer is picked up late.  Paying me any more or working me any less will never blunt what I see.  Fair wages are fair, and I support the BMA in arguing for them.  Talks collapse ... Dr Stanley blames Corbyn's 'new type of politics' for breakdown  Reuters 1  We all want fair pay through negotiation. But there are many aspects of safety the current talks haven’t even touched upon.  For example, changing our rotas so senior doctors can stay on two weeks more in August — when newly qualified doctors start — would help the new doctors begin their careers in a safer and more supportive environment.  I’m sick of hearing how my colleagues will leave the country if they don’t get all that they want, that they’ll somehow be forced on to a plane to the Great Barrier Reef.  No one is forcing anyone to do anything and we have a debt to repay.  Doctors are one in eight of all NHS staff but we get three-fifths of the training budget.  That’s great, of course, because we really do need the best training to treat you. But why can’t clawbacks be written into our contracts so that if we leave as consultants for warmer climes we must pay back our training?  It takes £400,000 to train a GP — and for surgeons and cardiologists it’s even more.  Two thousand senior doctors leaving the UK would cost us a billion. More than twice that number applied to work abroad just last year.  But with competition for training and for medical school so high, I have to admit we’ve been too easy on those wishing to walk off with the loot.  In fact, if we did close this loophole maybe Jeremy Hunt would have more money to spend on nurses, medicines and, yes, on increasing our pay too.  I have seen emails and briefings from BMA negotiators attacking the Government, calling Hunt a liar, calling for other unions and left-wing groups to join pickets.  I won’t breach confidentiality by publishing these documents, you’ll have to take my word for it.  These briefings are not in my name, and they don’t represent the views of most junior doctors I know.  They make it clear to me there are elements of the BMA that wanted a strike from the moment they got their ballot and have no intention of returning to talks.  Where does that leave the public?  Strikes, I fear, will increase in number and severity.  Maybe, in time for May’s local elections, Corbyn will ride to the rescue and save the day from the strikes he prompted. He may even reward some of his Labour friends inside the profession, but the end result will be a conspiracy against the public and the patients.  I support the BMA, I have been a member for ten years. It does vital work for doctors and, ultimately, serves all of our interests.  But it has allowed a few members with a radical left-wing agenda very different to the union’s own to hijack it.  I will lose friends in calling out this failure to avoid strikes where possible.  I remember my early days of training at Sheffield Medical School and its motto shines through: “The art is long and life is short.”  The standing, trust and legacy of the medical profession is bigger than this showdown — and it has to be. There is a difference between being a professional and an employee. This is an employee dispute, but we are professionals crucial to the life of the nation.  We need to start acting like it.  — Dr Jonathan Stanley is a junior doctor and a member of the Royal College of Surgeons.

230,230,other,"Our NHS is safer in Europe: #NHSsaferIN Our NHS is safer in Europe: #NHSsaferIN  14 Jun 2016, by Frances O'Grady in Public services  Today I’m proud to be joining NHS staff and supporters at a rally at Congress House. We’re coming together to say don’t risk a leave vote – Don’t risk our NHS. And there’s a lot to concern us, whether we work in the NHS or rely on it for our families’ health care.  To start with, there’s the potential loss of so many talented NHS staff from the EU. That could unleash a staffing crisis in the NHS.  Where on earth would our NHS be without all the staff who are so dedicated to it: The doctors, nurses and support staff? The NHS staffing roster includes 50,000 staff from the European Economic Area – including 9,000 doctors, 18,000 nurses and midwives, and over 2,000 other health professionals.  These are people who fill crucial skills gaps, and use their incredible knowledge and expertise to help save British lives.  Of course the government should be investing more in training opportunities for locals. Our government’s NHS bursary cuts have been the worst thing possible in dealing with a growing training crisis.  But migrants don’t clog the NHS up – they prop it up.  Yes, our NHS is at breaking point. Staff are over-worked and services are stretched. But that’s not because of decent, hard-working migrants who pay their way. Migrants are often younger people, less likely to need health services than the average UK citizen but still paying UK taxes to support them.  The NHS is in a staffing crisis because the government has imposed another five-year spending freeze. The Tories’ pay cap has created recruitment and retention problems throughout the service, which means more and more taxpayers money is wasted on agencies and management consultants, increasing our deep reliance on EU healthcare staff.  Across the NHS, staff are demoralized – fed up with too little funding to help the patients they care so deeply about, too many top down reorganisations and not enough ministerial respect. And fed up that their dedication is being taken for granted.  The EU’s Working Time Directive means we have rules that protect staff wellbeing, and don’t needlessly risk patient safety. We already have dedicated health staff putting in long hours, but many Brexit leaders want to overturn their rights to refuse excessive working hours and push them to work even longer.  And of course funding for the NHS depends on Britain’s economy doing well. Pretty much everyone agrees leaving the EU will hit the economy even brexiteers admit it would hurt in the short term, and that will put our crisis hit NHS even deeper in trouble.  Based on IFS analysis, if we leave the EU, the public purse is likely to lose enough money each year to fund the whole of NHS England for 3 months.  Of course not all the public spending cuts would fall on the NHS. But it could still be as much as £10 billion a year by the end of the decade. Equivalent to every hospital trust in England cutting 1,000 nurses and 155 doctors.  But the thing that gets me about the discussion of the NHS in this referendum campaign is the hypocrisy. Because when did the leading lights of Brexit ever give a toss about the NHS?  Does anyone really believe that Boris Johnson cares about the NHS? That’s the same Boris Johnson who is on record saying he doesn’t believe in a free NHS; and that if people paid for services, they’d value them more.  Or Michael Gove who co-authored a book saying the NHS is “no longer relevant in the 21st century”? Or Iain Duncan Smith, who has said he’d prefer a social insurance system? Or even Nigel Farage, who believes that within the next ten years the NHS should be replaced by private health insurance?  I don’t believe they support the NHS as we know and love it, any more than I believe they oppose the EU/US TTIP trade deal. If we came out of the EU, these men would sign us up to their own secret trade deals like a shot. We wouldn’t even know about the deals; let alone have the chance to change them.  But perhaps the Leave campaign’s most shameful fib of all is the claim that leaving the EU would mean more money for the NHS. Frankly, I was gobsmacked when I first saw the Leave campaign’s battle bus slogan.  As the Tory MP and former GP Sarah Wollaston said last week, when she defected from leave to remain: “it simply isn’t true”. Even if we trusted them to do the right thing with the cash, the sums simply don’t add up. They’ve been repeatedly slammed for it by the UK’s statistics watchdog.  The leave campaign are fond of saying we remainers are negative. To be honest when faced with a change that could cause such damage it’s hard not to be. But there are also positive reasons to vote Remain for our NHS.  Being in the EU helps make our NHS better. It means a common set of professional standards across the EU. And when you’re away for work or on holiday, British citizens get the right to free healthcare in other member states.  It also means significant funding for research and development into health. Just last year, the UK received £232 million of EU money – incidentally the largest slice of funding received by any EU member state. That included vital money for research at Great Ormond Street children’s hospital, University Hospital Birmingham and NHS Blood and Transplant services. It keeps the NHS at the forefront of healthcare worldwide.  So we have a choice to make. To build our NHS – or risk it. To back our NHS – or privatise it. And to celebrate and cherish NHS staff – or demonise and divide them. A vote to Leave isn’t just a big gamble with jobs, wages and rights, it’s also a big gamble with our NHS.  The NHS was built by and for working people. It is about solidarity, collaboration and co-operation. And it is too special, too precious, to entrust to the privatising Tories and UKIP, who are pushing Brexit as a way towards a deregulated, low-tax and low-services UK.  The NHS needs to be safeguarded if it’s going to be able to care for our children and grandchildren. I’ll be voting remain to do that."
231,231,other,"Budget 2017: National Insurance rate rise criticised Rises in National Insurance Contributions NICS for self-employed workers have been criticised as penalising entrepreneurs.  Chancellor Philip Hammond announced in the Budget that the rate for Class 4 NICS would rise from 9% to 10% in April 2018, and to 11% in 2019.  That compares to 12% currently paid by employees.  The difference in National Insurance Contributions is no longer justified, Mr Hammond said.  Self-employed people have traditionally paid lower NICS than employees, as they receive fewer state benefits.  But the chancellor said the self-employed now had equal access to the new state pension. He also said that the government would consult on parental benefits, some of which self-employed people cannot claim.  The chancellor said all self-employed people who earned less than £16,250 would be better off.  Around half of the 4.8 million workers registered as self-employed earn less than £13,000, according to the think tank the Resolution Foundation.  As a result it said most such workers - such as low-paid hairdressers - will be better off by 2019/20. line Winners and Losers hairdresserimage copyrightGetty Images      A self-employed hairdresser - with average earnings of £12,700 - will be £70 better off       A self-employed taxi driver - with average earnings of £17,300 - will be £20 worse off      A self-employed management consultant - with average earnings of £51,100 - will be £620 worse off.  source: Resolution Foundation line  But the rise, which will cost those affected an average of 60p a week, was criticised by entrepreneurs.  Increasing National Insurance rates for the self-employed could be a further step by the government to penalise those who are taking risks and starting a business, said Lucy-Rose Walker, the chief executive of Entrepreneurial Spark.  Others said it was unfair that the self-employed would have to pay more, when they do not receive the same level of state benefits.  Self-employees are subject to a lower national insurance contribution because they do not receive the same entitlements and benefits as their employed counterparts - such as holiday and sick leave, said Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of tax at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants.

232,232,other,"Most secondary schools 'use teachers not trained in their subject' Pupils in most secondary schools are being taught by staff not trained in the subject they are teaching, according to a new report.  A survey of 885 schools by the Association of School and College Leaders, which represents secondary school heads, reveals 73 per cent were having to put teachers not trained in the subject they were teaching in front of classes. In addition, 84 per cent said that teacher shortages were having a detrimental effect on the education they were providing.  The subject areas worst hit by what has been described by ASCL president Allan Foulds as a “national crisis” are maths where 78 per of schools are having to make do with staff not trained in the subject, science 75 per cent and English 57 per cent.  Other problem areas are languages with 33 per cent of schools using non-specialist teachers, geography 25 per cent and history 14 per cent. In all, 89 per cent said they were experiencing difficulties in recruiting teachers.  Last month, the National Audit Office revealed that the Department for Education has failed to meet its recruitment targets for trainee teachers for the past four years. The Chief Inspector of Schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, also warned last week of a “brain drain” as teachers opt for jobs in satellite schools abroad, set up by many of the country’s leading independent schools.  The survey coincides with the ASCL’s annual conference this weekend, at which the Education Secretary, Nicky Morgan, is expected to be put under pressure to take action on teacher shortages.  “Teacher shortages leave schools with no option other than to use stop-gap solutions,” said Malcolm Trobe, ASCL general secretary. “Supply staff and non-specialists often do a good job in difficult circumstances, but it is no substitute for having permanent teachers who are experts in their subjects.”  Please enter your email address Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP Thanks for signing up to the News newsletter {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Iain Duncan Smith revealed the figure yesterday as he promised a jobcentre scheme to identify the addictions which are stopping claimants find work.  Under the Universal Support regime, officials will take personal charge of each case to ensure they get treatment, mental health counselling and other support.  Iain Duncan Smith said it costs the taxpayer £10.1billion a year to support people addicted to drugs file photo  Once people have found a job, they will remain under the care of the jobcentre until they are doing sufficient hours to leave the accompanying Universal Credit benefits regime altogether.  The work and pensions secretary said the aim was to find jobs for people who had been ‘parked’ on a life on benefits by the last government.  Mr Duncan Smith added: ‘Too often in the past, people with complex barriers such as addiction, indebtedness or homelessness were written off to a life on benefits.  'Through Universal Support we are putting an end to this, and offering wraparound support for those that need it.  ‘These problems are the root causes of poverty – and if not tackled mean that the cycle of disadvantage will continue into the next generation.’  He pointed to a devastating report by the Lankelly Chase Foundation which found the wider cost to the taxpayer of supporting people with the most severe problems was £10.1 billion a year.  Mr Duncan Smith, pictured, has faced fierce criticism from the Church for his welfare reforms  There are 586,000 people categorised as having at least one serious problem – such as addiction to drink or drugs or homelessness.  Officials said the aim was to reduce the cost of social breakdown by addressing all the ‘barriers’ they face to getting on in life and finding a job.  One said: ‘This is not about cutting benefits – it is about reducing the need.’  Mr Duncan Smith revealed that, for the first time, the Department of Health had acknowledged that having a job improved a person’s health and well-being.  The new policy will allow people who claim mental health problems are preventing them from finding work to access more support.  In about 60 per cent of cases, the problem they have is anxiety or depression.  Help will also be available for people who have problems with housing, childcare, debt and a history of offending.  Mr Duncan Smith has faced fierce criticism from the Church and critics on the Left for his welfare reforms, which they claimed would create ‘unacceptable’ suffering.  But, following a raft of changes to the benefits system designed to incentivise work, the number of children growing up in homes in which nobody has a job has plummeted by 478,000.  The overall number of households where no one was in work fell to the lowest on record in 2015 – almost 700,000 fewer than in 2010."

An analysis of Britain's waste water, carried out by forensic scientists at King's College London, has also proved that the purity of the class A drug has gone up, hitting a record high.  Tests of the drug in sewage show Londoners are taking almost 200,000 doses of cocaine every day, which amounts to about £700,000.  The research found that one in 50 Londoners currently takes the drug on a daily basis  Concentrations in waste water are 900 milligrams per 1,000 of the population per day, which rose from 392 milligrams per 1,000 in 2011.  The average cocaine dose through smoking or snorting is 40 milligrams, meaning that, in a population of nine million people, one in 50 is taking the class A drug on a daily basis.  The research also found out that the use of cocaine in London is almost as high during weekdays as it is at the weekend.  The use of cocaine in London is almost as high during the week as it is at the weekend  Last year, the Global Drug Survey reported that the British capital is one of cities in the world where cocaine can be delivered faster than pizza, thanks to the use of smartphones and encrypted messaging services.  London, Bristol, Barcelona, Antwerp, Zurich and Amsterdam are considered the top cities in Europe for the use of cocaine.  A study carried out by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in 2015 found that London was the city with the highest concentration of cocaine in its sewage in Europe.  Cocaine purity is soaring thanks to the increased supply and production in Latin America  Traces of the drug have been found in fish and shrimps in Suffolk.  A study published last summer found that endangered eels could become 'hyperactive' because of the presence of drugs in Britain's waters.  Biologists at the University of Naples Federico II also found that the the drugs accumulate in the animals' brains, muscles, gills and skin.  Dr Leon Barron, who led the latest analysis at King's College London, said the purity of cocaine has also risen through the increased supply and production in Latin America.  Recent research by the National Crime Agency confirmed cocaine purity is at 'historically high levels'.  Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan Police commissioner, said cocaine users often fuel gang violence and knife crime.  Pure cocaine is sold for about £100 per gram on the street.  Cocaine seizures have trebled in five hears, from 42.8 tons in 2013-14 to 122.9 tons in 2017-18, The Telegraph reported.  Dr Barron said treating sewage can remove most of the cocaine from waste water before it is recycled into rivers."

Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice  MPs from across the political divide have demanded an urgent decision on whether to expand Heathrow or Gatwick airport.  The delay in making a decision over where to build a new runway is costing the UK up to £6m a day, a report by a cross-party Commons body claims.  The British Infrastructure Group BIG, headed by Conservative MP Grant Shapps, urged new prime minister Theresa May to show her mettle by ending the speculation.  Its report entitled Gate Now Closing , which was published on Sunday July 24, calls for an urgent and immediate decision on hub airport expansion.  The report does not state where group thinks a new runway should be built, but it argues that the indecision is having a deleterious effect on Britain's businesses, the economy and jobs.  'Problem of capacity... causing substantial damage'  The problem of capacity at the current hub, Heathrow, is causing substantial damage to the industry as a whole, the report says.  It erodes confidence in the Government's stated ambition of growing the economy and our international trade.  The evidence has been gathered by the Airports Commission. Now a decision is needed, to show the new leadership's mettle.  The Airports Commission last summer recommended building a third runway at Heathrow over a second landing strip at Gatwick.  Still no date for Heathrow announcement  The Government's decision was initially delayed last year when further environmental studies were commissioned , and then in June following the outcome of the EU referendum.  The Department for Transport has not indicated when a decision is likely, following Chris Grayling's appointment as the new transport secretary.  Theresa May's election as prime minister, and the appointment to her cabinet of a number of Heathrow opponents , saw one bookmaker slash the odds on Gatwick winning the battle for a new runway.

237,237,other,"Relentless' workload forcing 'desperate' teachers to leave profession with big pay cuts Teachers who leave the profession for other jobs are taking substantial pay cuts, a new study published tonight reveals.  The research by the NFER National Foundation for Educational Research looked at teachers who left for different occupations over the past 14 years and found that, on average, their pay dropped by 10 per cent, compared with those who stayed in teaching.  It reveals that some teachers – who left to become teaching assistants or who took up a job in the public sector – saw a drop in their wages of up to 30 per cent.  Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said she knew of a teacher who had become a bus driver because they felt “anything was preferable to the lack of quality of life” that came with teaching.  “The fact that teachers are taking lower paid jobs reflects the desperation that many teachers feel, she said. The relentless nature of the workload and pressure is leading to teachers just walking. They can see no way they can remain in teaching and so they lose professional status and money.”  But the NFER analysis, of the government Labour Force Survey LFS data, can only indicate how the teachers' pay has changed in the short term as the LFS only follows up individuals for one year.  The Should I Stay or Should I Go? report concludes: “The short-term pay benefits from a career move may be limited by the need to prove value to new employers and develop skills for a different career. The prospect of higher pay in the longer-term may still have been a motivation for some teachers who left teaching.”  The report added that it is “possible that career-changers from other professions experience a similar fall in wages and this phenomenon is not likely to be unique to teaching.”  According to the research, more than half 51 per cent of teachers who leave teaching take up jobs in the education sector excluding those who leave to retire.  Carole Willis, NFER chief executive, said: “Recruiting and retaining good quality teachers is a key issue facing the education system over the next five to 10 years. Understanding the types of jobs former teachers are going into and their underlying motivations is crucial for formulating an appropriate policy response.”  The NFER analysed a sample of 6,896 teachers, including 936 who left teaching and 774 who joined teaching, over a 14-year period 2001-2015.

Sign up Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice  There is no strong evidence that children under ten have passed coronavirus onto adults, researchers have suggested.  Young children do not play a significant role in spreading the virus and are significantly less likely to become infected than adults, according to a review of existing research into Covid-19 and children by the Royal College of Paediatricians and Child Health RCPCH said.  It worked with other research teams to examine the correlation in studies of transmission from children to adults after public health officials in Switzerland said today under-10s could finally hug their grandparents again as they pose no risk to them.  The review, by the Don't Forget the Bubbles paediatric research project, stated: Notably, the China/WHO joint commission could not recall episodes during contact tracing where transmission occurred from a child to an adult.  Image: REUTERS  But the review also urged caution as it is still unknown whether children have passed on the virus, particularly given large numbers of asymptomatic cases.  A nine-year-old British boy who contracted coronavirus in a French Alps did not pass it on, despite having contact with more than 170 people at three schools. This case was studied as part of the research.  Dr Alasdair Munro, the clinical research fellow in paediatric infectious diseases who led the research, said: Covid-19 appears to affect children less often, and with less severity, including frequent asymptomatic or sub-clinical infection.  There is evidence of critical illness, but it is rare.  The role of children in transmission is unclear, but it seems likely they do not play a significant role.  Professor Russell Viner, the president of the RCPCH, said: From around the world, we are not seeing evidence that children are involved in spreading or transmitting the virus, but we do not have enough evidence.  Prof Viner added that it was too soon to say children could hug their grandparents, particularly as the over-70s are the most vulnerable.  Note: Children are not believed to play a significant role in the spread of coronavirus. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that a study had found no cases of children passing coronavirus to an adult exist."

243,243,other,"If Everyone Ate Beans Instead of Beef Like what?  Helen Harwatt is a researcher trained in environmental nutrition, a field focused on developing food systems that balance human health and sustainability. She’s interested in policy, but realistic about how much progress can be expected under the aforementioned leadership. So she and colleagues have done research on maximizing the impacts of individuals. As with so many things in life and health, that tends to come down to food.  Recently Harwatt and a team of scientists from Oregon State University, Bard College, and Loma Linda University calculated just what would happen if every American made one dietary change: substituting beans for beef. They found that if everyone were willing and able to do that—hypothetically—the U.S. could still come close to meeting its 2020 greenhouse-gas emission goals, pledged by President Barack Obama in 2009.  That is, even if nothing about our energy infrastructure or transportation system changed—and even if people kept eating chicken and pork and eggs and cheese—this one dietary change could achieve somewhere between 46 and 74 percent of the reductions needed to meet the target.  “I think there’s genuinely a lack of awareness about how much impact this sort of change can have,” Harwatt told me. There have been analyses in the past about the environmental impacts of veganism and vegetarianism, but this study is novel for the idea that a person’s dedication to the cause doesn’t have to be complete in order to matter. A relatively small, single-food substitution could be the most powerful change a person makes in terms of their lifetime environmental impact—more so than downsizing one’s car, or being vigilant about turning off light bulbs, and certainly more than quitting showering.  Read: The economic case for worldwide vegetarianism  To understand why the climate impact of beef alone is so large, note that the image at the top of this story is a sea of soybeans in a silo in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest. The beans belong to a feed lot that holds 38,000 cattle, the growth and fattening of which means dispensing 900 metric tons of feed every day. Which is to say that these beans will be eaten by cows, and the cows will convert the beans to meat, and the humans will eat the meat. In the process, the cows will emit much greenhouse gas, and they will consume far more calories in beans than they will yield in meat, meaning far more clearcutting of forests to farm cattle feed than would be necessary if the beans above were simply eaten by people.  This inefficient process happens on a massive scale. Brazil, the world’s largest exporter of red meat, holds around 212 million cattle. (In June, the U.S. temporarily suspended imports of beef from Brazil due to abscesses, collections of pus, in the meat.) According to the United Nations, 33 percent of arable land on Earth is used to grow feed for livestock. Even more, 26 percent of the ice-free terrestrial surface of Earth is used for grazing livestock. In all, almost a third of the land on Earth is used to produce meat and animal products."
244,244,other,"Arctic ice melt 'already affecting weather patterns where you live right now' The dramatic melting of Arctic ice is already driving extreme weather that affects hundreds of millions of people across North America, Europe and Asia, leading climate scientists have told the Guardian.
Severe “snowmageddon” winters are now strongly linked to soaring polar temperatures, say researchers, with deadly summer heatwaves and torrential floods also probably linked. The scientists now fear the Arctic meltdown has kickstarted abrupt changes in the planet’s swirling atmosphere, bringing extreme weather in heavily populated areas to the boil. The northern ice cap has been shrinking since the 1970s, with global warming driving the loss of about three-quarters of its volume so far. But the recent heat in the Arctic has shocked scientists, with temperatures 33C above average in parts of the Russian Arctic and 20C higher in some other places. In November, ice levels hit a record low, and we are now in “uncharted territory”, said Prof Jennifer Francis, an Arctic climate expert at Rutgers University in the US, who first became interested in the region when she sailed through it on a round-the-world trip in the 1980s. “These rapid changes in the Arctic are affecting weather patterns where you live right now,” she said. “In the past you have had natural variations like El Niño, but they have never happened before in combination with this very warm Arctic, so it is a whole new ball game. “It is inconceivable that this ridiculously warm Arctic would not have an impact on weather patterns in the middle latitudes further south, where so many people live. “It’s safe to say [the hot Arctic] is going to have a big impact, but it’s hard to say exactly how big right now. But we are going to have a lot of very interesting weather – we’re not going to get around that one.” The area covered by Arctic sea ice at least four years old has decreased from 718,000 sq miles in September 1984 to 42,000 sq miles in September 2016. Older ice tends to be less vulnerable to melting. The age of the ice is indicated by shades ranging from blue-gray for the youngest ice to white for the oldest. Credits: Nasa The chain of events that links the melting Arctic with weather to the south begins with rising global temperatures causing more sea ice to melt. Unlike on the Antarctic continent, melting ice here exposes dark ocean beneath, which absorbs more sunlight than ice and warms further. This feedback loop is why the Arctic is heating up much faster than the rest of the planet.
This in turn narrows the temperature difference between the Arctic and lower latitudes, which is crucial because it is the temperature gradient between them that drives the jet stream wind, which streaks around the pole at up to 250mph and about 8km above the surface. The jet stream forms a boundary between the cold north and the warmer south, but the lower temperature difference means the winds are now weaker. This means the jet stream meanders more, with big loops bringing warm air to the frozen north and cold air into warmer southern climes. Furthermore, researchers say, the changes mean the loops can remain stuck over regions for weeks, rather than being blown westwards as in the past. This “blocking” effect means extreme events can unfold.
“There have been recent studies showing very plausible physical mechanisms of how rapid warming in the Arctic can influence weather in the mid latitudes, both in summer and winter,” said Dim Coumou at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. Coumou is a former offshore industry geophysicist who has studied the link between extreme weather events and global warming since 2010. “A couple of years ago this was the main criticism on any such links, that the physics was not well understood,” he said. “But the big question [now] is, how important are these mechanisms?” The other main influence on the jet stream is sea surface temperature in the tropics, which waxes and wanes with El Niño, while solar cycles and even volcanic eruptions have smaller effects. The clearest connection so far between the melting Arctic and weather is for extreme winter conditions, such as the intense winters that hit parts of North America and northern Europe in 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2013-14, causing record snowfalls and billions of dollars of damage. In those years, the jet stream deviated deeply southwards over those regions, pulling down savagely cold air. Prof Adam Scaife, a climate modelling expert at the UK’s Met Office, said the evidence for a link to shrinking Arctic ice was now good: “The consensus points towards that being a real effect.” While downswings of the jet stream can bring freezing winters, the accompanying upswings have been linked to worsening the drought in California. “These northward jet stream swings are of course the reason California is having such a terrible drought,” said Francis. This effect was in fact predicted back in 2004, with those researchers now saying: “Reality is moving faster than we thought or hoped it would.”
But the winter extremes can also swing the other way and bring mild but torrential weather, as seen in the past two winters in the UK, leading to severe flooding, said Prof Edward Hanna, at the University of Sheffield in the UK.
150 years of global warming in a minute-long symphony Guardian He pointed to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a cyclic variation in air pressure that may be affected by the fast melting of Arctic ice. The variability of the NOA has doubled in the last century, he said: “Within the last decade, there have been wild swings in the NAO values in December.” The connection between the vanishing Arctic ice and extreme summer weather in the northern hemisphere is probable, according to scientists, but not yet as certain as the winter link. Blocking patterns caused by slow-moving meanders of the jet stream have been firmly linked to some devastating events, including the 2010 summer floods in Pakistan, which killed 2,000 people and affected 20 million, and also the searing heatwave in Russia in the same year, which killed 50,000 people and wiped out $15bn (£12bn) of crops. Villagers stand outside their homes during flash floods on the outskirts of Peshawar, Pakistan, April 2016
“We also see such summer events more often in recent years,” said Coumou. Blocking events have also been linked to summer deluges in the UK, leading to disastrous flooding in 2007 and 2012 which caused billions of pounds in damage.
The year 2012 was also an extreme year for Greenland, with record melting across its entire surface flushing water into the ocean and accelerating sea level rise. The hot loop of air that sat on Greenland that year may also be linked to one of the biggest weather disasters of recent years: Hurricane Sandy, which killed 233 people and cost $75bn in damages. Scientists suspect that the blocking event over Greenland, potentially linked to the record low Arctic ice that summer, prevented the hurricane veering north-east out into the Atlantic like most storms. Instead, blocked by the high pressure, Sandy swung left over the most populated area of the east coast of the US. Damage caused by Hurricane Sandy in Rodanthe, North Carolina, October 2012
Another consequence of the fast melting Arctic raises the possibility that there may be even worse extreme weather to come, according to a few scientists: titanic Atlantic superstorms and hurricanes barreling across Europe.
The melting of Greenland ice is pouring about 250bn tonnes a year of fresh water, which is less dense than salty sea water, into the ocean. As a result, the water mass sinks less and the current that drags warm water up the Atlantic is weakened – scientists have already found that the current is at its weakest for a millennium. This means a region of the north Atlantic is becoming relatively cool and this exaggerates the contrast with tropical waters to the south, which is the driver for storms. In the worst case scenario, said the renowned climate scientist Prof James Hansen, this “will drive superstorms, stronger than any in modern times – all hell will break loose in the north Atlantic and neighbouring lands”.
Hansen– who was one of the first scientists to alert the world to the dangers of climate change in 1988 and has been arrested more than once outside the White House while protesting against fossil fuel developments – pointed to the historical record as a precedent: 118,000 years ago a superstorm tossed 1,000-tonne mega boulders on to the shores of the Bahamas.
“I would certainly not call such [superstorm] scenarios ridiculous,” said Coumou. “But it is speculative – we don’t have the hard evidence.”
But even with what is known so far, there is cause for concern that the complex interactions are turning the slow burn of global temperature rise into sudden weather disasters.
“The worrying aspect is that such dynamical changes can occur more abruptly than simple background warming of the climate,” said Coumou. “Dynamical changes can change more rapidly and can therefore lead to surprises and I think there are many such possibilities in the system.” A polar bear swims in Svalbard. The fjords there would usually be partially covered with sea ice, but last winter most of the archipelago was surrounded by open water. 
Amid the gloomy prospects, there is some cause for hope however. “A large fraction of the US public still doesn’t believe that it is humans that are affecting the climate system,” said Francis. “But one of the silver linings of this pretty dark cloud is that the Arctic is such an obvious and conspicuous change, that anybody can see them happening. There is no ambiguity whatsoever.”
But this changing of minds needs to happen quickly, said Hansen: “If we wait for the natural world to reveal itself clearly, it may be too late.”"

The study looked at over 32,000 individuals who had received either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines and monitored them for heart-related conditions between June 1, 2021, and July 31, 2021.  32 of the study subjects were admitted into the hospital with heart and chest-related symptoms.  “There were 15,997 doses of Moderna vaccine, and 16,382 doses of Pfizer vaccine administered over the study period, for a total of 32,379 doses. Note that these numbers represent a mixture of first and second doses. TRENDING: ""I Went There for You My Son"" - J6 Political Prisoner Chris Quaglin Was Brutally Beaten in Jail and Denied Celiac-Safe Food - Here Is His Heartfelt Letter to His Son on His First Birthday -- Please Donate Therefore, if our cohort captured all cases in the Ottawa area, then the incidence of myocarditis would be 0.1% of all vaccine doses (32 cases/32,379 doses x 100), or 10 cases of myocarditis for every 10,000 doses of vaccine.”  Researchers found that the symptoms show up extremely quickly after vaccination, usually after the patient’s second dose. On average, people who were affected developed the condition after just 1.5 days.  They also found that men are at a much greater risk than women – only 2 women experienced heart inflammation.  “32 patients were identified over the period of interest. Eighteen patients were diagnosed with myocarditis; 12 with myopericarditis; and 2 with pericarditis alone. The median age was 33 years (18-65 years). The sex ratio was 2 females to 29 males. In 5 cases, symptoms developed after only a single dose of mRNA vaccine. In 27 patients, symptoms developed after their second dose of. Median time between vaccine dose and symptoms was 1.5 days (1-26 days).”  People who took the Moderna jab were 3x more likely to develop symptoms than those who took the Pfizer shot.  To date, this has been the largest case study that has looked at the correlation between Covid mRNA vaccines and myocarditis symptoms within a month of vaccination.  If the results are true, it would actually be more of a risk for anyone under 65 to receive the shot than it would be to contract the virus and recover, especially depending on how young they are. Myocarditis and pericarditis both come with an extremely poor prognosis and end up killing over 50% within 3-10 years of their diagnosis.  According to the most recent data, Americans under 65 have about a 1 in 1863 (Population – 273,820,000 / Total Covid deaths – 146,991) or .00054 chance of dying from Covid-19 or .054%. If you lower the age to 50 and under, the chance that Covid is fatal drops precipitously to .00017 or 1 in 5841 or .o17%.  In other words, the chances that covid will kill you if you are under 50 are almost 6x lower than the chances you will develop a debilitating (and often fatal in the long run) heart condition.  Even more shocking – people under 40 who take the jab are almost 13.5 times more likely to develop some form of myocarditis or pericarditis than to be killed by Covid. Keep in mind the median age from this study was 33.  Meanwhile, Joe Biden and the tyrannical health regime double down on their goal to get “every American” vaccinated by cramming down a new dictatorial federal mandate with a third experimental ‘booster’ jab being prepared for a massive rollout.  The Covid-19 vaccine has been so ‘effective’ in ‘protecting’ people that the masses will now be pressured into taking another dose as new outbreaks of the virus have forced a new wave of authoritarian restrictions.  Every single American has known for months where to go and how to get a vaccine if they wanted one. In fact, over 181 million eligible citizens have been fully vaccinated in the US – If the virus was as deadly as they are making it out to be, they wouldn’t have to mandate people to take the vaccine; and on the other end, if the vaccines provided the protection they’re supposed to provide, the vaccinated wouldn’t be calling people killers because they are refusing to ‘protect others.’  Besides, according to available data, a third of the entire US population had contracted Covid BY THE END OF 2020. Natural immunity has always proven to be superior to vaccines.  A recent study that was conducted in Israel on 800,000 individuals confirms that is especially the case with the rushed mRNA Covid vaccines.  They found that individuals who had received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were 13x more likely to contract Covid-19 than those who had natural immunity – Fully vaccinated people were also found to be at a “GREATER RISK OF HOSPITALIZATION.”  If 1/3rd of Americans had already contracted the virus – before it had even been known for a full year – then why would “everyone” be forced to take the experimental vaccine?  Exactly what sCiEnCe is being followed with these vaccine mandates and passports?"

248,248,other,"Amish Covid When it comes to actions taken to address the Covid-19 threat, hindsight is still very much underway. For your consideration: a story and outcome you probably aren't hearing much about anywhere else. It takes place in the heart of Amish country.  Lancaster County, Pennsylvania: thousands of families lead lives largely separate from modern America.  The Amish are a Christian group that emphasizes the virtuous over the superficial. They don’t usually drive, use electricity, or have TVs. And during the Covid-19 outbreak, they became subjects in a massive social and medical experiment.  Sharyl: So, it's safe to say there was a whole different approach here in this community when coronavirus broke out than many other places?  Calvin Lapp: Absolutely.  Calvin Lapp is Amish Mennonite.  Lapp: There’s three things the Amish don't like. And that's government— they won't get involved in the government, they don't like the public education system— they won't send their children to education, and they also don't like the health system. They rip us off. Those are three things that we feel like we're fighting against all the time. Well, those three things are all part of what Covid is.  After a short shutdown last year, the Amish chose a unique path that led to Covid-19 tearing through at warp speed. It began with an important religious holiday in May.  Lapp: When they take communion, they dump their wine into a cup and they take turns to drink out of that cup. So, you go the whole way down the line, and everybody drinks out of that cup, if one person has coronavirus, the rest of church is going to get coronavirus. The first time they went back to church, everybody got coronavirus.  Lapp says they weren’t denying coronavirus, they were facing it head on.  Lapp: It’s a worse thing to quit working than dying. Working is more important than dying. But to shut down and say that we can't go to church, we can't get together with family, we can't see our old people in the hospital, we got to quit working? It's going completely against everything that we believe. You're changing our culture completely to try to act like they wanted us to act the last year, and we're not going to do it.  Steve Nolt is a scholar on Amish and Mennonite culture, and Mennonite himself. He’s studying Amish news publications to analyze community-wide trends.  Sharyl: So, are you saying, as of about May of 2020, things kind of went back to normal in the Amish community?  Steve Nolt: For the most part, yeah, by the middle of May, it's sort of like back to a typical behavior again.  That also meant avoiding hospitals.  Nolt: I know of some cases in which Amish people refused to go to the hospital, even when they were very sick because if they went there, they wouldn't be able to have visitors. And it was more important to be sick, even very sick at home and have the ability to have some people around you than to go to the hospital and be isolated.  Then, last March, remarkable news. The Lancaster County Amish were reported to be the first community to achieve “herd immunity,” meaning a large part of a population had been infected with Covid-19 and became immune.  Some outsiders are skeptical, and solid proof is hard to come by.  Nolt: Even those who believed that they had Covid tended not to get tested. Their approach tended to be, “I'm sick. I know I'm sick. I don't have to have someone else telling me I'm sick.” Or a concern that if they got a positive test, they would then be asked to really dramatically limit what they were doing in a way that might be uncomfortable for them. So, we don't have that testing number.  Lapp: We didn't want the numbers to go up, because then they would shut things more. What's the advantage of getting a test?  One thing’s clear: there's no evidence of any more deaths among the Amish than in places that shut down tight— some claim there were fewer here. That’s without masking, staying at home, or another important measure.  Sharyl: Did most of the community, at least the adults, get the Covid-19 vaccine?  Nolt: Again, we don't have data on that, but I think it's pretty clear that in percentage terms, relatively few did.  Lapp: Oh, we're glad all the English people got their Covid vaccines. That's great. Because now we don't have to wear a mask, we can do what we want. So good for you. Thank you. We appreciate it. Us? No, we're not getting vaccines. Of course not. We all got the Covid, so why would you get a vaccine?  By staying open, the Amish here have one tangible 2020 accomplishment few others can claim.  Lapp: We have this joke: when everybody else started walking, we started running. We made more money in the last year than we ever did. It was our best year ever.  Did the Amish really find a magic formula? They say yes. And they don’t care who doubts it.  Lapp: Yeah, all the Amish know we got herd immunity. Of course we got herd immunity! The whole church gets coronavirus. We know we got coronavirus. We think we’re smarter than everybody. We shouldn’t be bragging, but we think we did the right thing.  Sharyl (on-camera): Nolt, the scholar, is publishing a paper on the Amish social response to government mandates and Covid-19."
249,249,other,"Study: Tech Companies That Made Black Lives Matter Pledges Have 20% Fewer Black Employees According to a new study of tech companies that made pledges to support the black lives matter movement, those companies actually employed fewer black employees on average than companies that didn’t take any public stance. That comes despite the supporting companies making a combined $4.6 billion in financial commitments to the cause.  As Bloomberg reports:  A new study of diversity in the technology industry found companies that made statements of solidarity had 20% fewer Black employees on average than those that didn’t. The finding highlights a gap between what companies say about social issues and what they do in their own workplaces, said Stephanie Lampkin, the founder and chief executive officer of Blendoor, which conducted the study.  Obviously no company should be hiring specifically because one belongs to a particular demographic over skill, but it is amusing an amusing juxtaposition nonetheless.  Corporations pretending to take political stances for the purpose of promoting a public image of themselves is nothing new. We saw this when companies like Apple, Nike, and Coca-Cola all came out with their “principled stands against injustice” in opposing common sense voter integrity laws in George – as they were lobbying against a bill that would bar U.S. companies from relying on forced Uighur labor in China.  This is nothing new either. Decades ago, in response to businesses capitalizing off of climate change hysteria there was even a term coined to describe the practice of companies deceptively marketing themselves as “green” and “environmentally friendly” solely to boost business: greenwashing.  Woke capitalism is on the rise, and it won’t go away until everyone wakes up to the blatantly obvious fact that it’s just a marketing campaign.

250,250,other,"Congressman Lynch: 72 Department of Homeland Security Employees On Terrorist Watchlist Listen 0:00 BOSPUB-1.mp3  Earlier this month, 47 democrats in the house of representatives defied a house veto threat by backing a GOP bill to ramp up screening requirements for Syrian and Iraqi refugees. Congressman Stephen Lynch was among them. He joined Jim Braude and Margery Eagan on Boston Public Radio to discuss the reasoning behind his vote and other congressional matters.  Questions are paraphrased, and responses are edited where noted [...].  MARGERY: Let’s start with the vote on the Syrian refugees. Why were you with those 47 other democrats?  It’s a very simple bill, I know that it’s got subsumed within a larger discussion about immigration policy, but basically, the bill we voted on was a very short bill—four pages in length, basically, and it said that the director of national security shall review the vetting process as being conducted by both the FBI and the department of homeland security. Because of the disastrous results we’ve had so far with the screening process, especially the department of homeland security, I think it was a very good idea to have another set of eyeballs looking at that process.  Back in August, we did an investigation—the inspector General did—of the Department of Homeland Security, and they had 72 individuals that were on the terrorist watch list that were actually working at the Department of Homeland Security. The director had to resign because of that. Then we went further and did and eight-airport investigation. We had staffers go into eight different airports to test the department of homeland security screening process at major airports. They had a 95 percent failure rate. We had folks—this was a testing exercise, so we had folks going in there with guns on their ankles, and other weapons on their persons, and there was a 95 percent failure rate.  I have very low confidence based on empirical data that we’ve got on the Department of Homeland Security. I think we desperately need another set of eyeballs looking at the vetting process. That’s vetting that’s being done at major airports where we have a stationary person coming through a facility, and we’re failing 95 percent of the time. I have even lower confidence that they can conduct the vetting process in places like Jordan, or Belize or on the Syrian border, or in Cairo, or Beirut in any better fashion, especially given the huge volume of applicants we’ve had seeking refugee status.  JIM: Even if you’re right that the system needs strengthening, the most likely way that a terrorist would come into this country is not through an 18-24 month-long process, but through this Visa program that allows 20 million people from 38 countries to come here every single year with absolutely no prior approval at all.  We had Democratic and Republican proposals on this bill, and there wasn’t a dime’s worth of difference between the two of them. It became a sort of a proxy battle over immigration. You had a bunch of Republican governors who were using it politically, and saying, “we’re going to stop refugees from coming into our state, which is baloney because they have no ability—zero ability—under the constitution to actually prevent refugees from coming into their state. You also had other people on the far left saying that this would stop every person from coming into the United States. In both cases, if they only took the time to read the bill, they would see that it did not do either. The democratic proposal also requires a multi-layered vetting process of refugees.  The reason the refugee issue came up and not the Visa waiver program is because in the Paris example, you had somebody go into the stream of legitimate refugees and then perpetrate acts of violence upon the civilians in Paris. That’s why that example came to the forefront.  I agree with you—I think the Visa waiver program, where you’ve got 20 million people coming in, versus the [refugees] coming in, 10,000? perhaps? At the end of the day, obviously the Visa waiver program is the one that we should be looking at.  JIM: Governor Charlie Baker was one of those governors who hesitated about refugees coming to Massachusetts—he didn’t sign the letter that Republican governors sent to the president, but he did state that he wanted a pause on the whole refugee thing. Was he grandstanding in your opinion?  I don’t think he was. If you listen to his press conference, when he addressed it, I thought his remarks were very thoughtful, and I thought his remarks were very measured, compared to what you heard from some of the red state governors that were doing a lot of the chest bumping and that sort of thing. Governor Baker was asking for more information, which I think was totally appropriate.  MARGERY: You just mentioned the TSA’s terrible record. You mentioned having low confidence in the Department of Homeland Security… is it every man for himself every time you get in an airplane?  I think that they… The resources are being spent, I think there are a bunch of different weaknesses in our system, I think we have very low-paid TSA and DHS workers, I think there’s a huge turnover there, when you talk to the people at the airport who are actually working there. When Bush created this system, I think it was 700,000 employees, he basically stripped away their right to join a union. They’re trying to use low-wage employees there, I heard from a TSA employee last week who was leaving, and he said there’s just no room for advancement there, they’re just stuck. I think morale is part of it, and the whole screening process is being revisited now after the inspector general’s report.  MARGERY: If Homeland Security is so inept, but we depend on them, should we be much more scared than we are? Should the focus be to better train DHS employees?  Absolutely...we had a hearing three weeks ago where the new TSA director said that they’re going back to the drawing board, and beginning again in terms of what their approach is. That’s a good thing. It’s a little bit late in coming, but I think because of what happened in Paris and what happened in Egypt with the airliner, what happened in Beirut… We’re redoubling our efforts, but obviously the system that was initially put in place was inadequate.

252,252,other,"San Francisco Is Going To Pay People $300 A Month Not To Shoot Others In an attempt to reduce violent crime, San Francisco, California, will launch a program that will pay people $300 a month if they don’t shoot someone.  Fox News reported that the program, called Dream Keeper Fellowship, “will pay 10 individuals who are at high risk of being on either end of a shooting $300 each month to not be involved in such crimes.” This means that people at high risk of being shot also qualify for the program, though it’s unclear how the determination is made. The program will launch in October.  Sheryl Davis, executive director of the Human Rights Commission, told Newsweek that the program is not “transactional,” as it may seem.  “It’s not necessarily as cut and dry as folks may think. It’s not as transactional as, ‘Here’s a few dollars so that you don’t do something bad,’ but it really is about how you help us improve public safety in the neighborhood,” she told the outlet.  From Newsweek:  Participants will be paired with life coaches from the city’s Street Violence Intervention Program and will be considered “community ambassadors” who work to prevent violence. They will work on their professional, personal, and community development and will be thought of as “partners” in engaging community members and decreasing violence.  Davis said the program will attempt to find the “root causes” of violence, which she said in “so many ways are economic.”  This sentiment was echoed by San Francisco Mayor London Breed.  “In many cases, sadly, the common denominator is that these folks do not have any sort of income. And so part of what we’re trying to do is make sure that money is not a barrier to turning your life around,” Breed said, according to The Telegraph.  Participants in the program can earn even more money by getting a job, going to school, or even mediating situations that may lead to violence. In other words, the program will pay people to do things they should be doing anyway. What happens if and when that money stops? Will the people continue to work or follow the law? Will they need to be paid this way forever?  Newsweek reported that the program in San Francisco is based on a similar one in Richmond, California, which the American Journal of Public Health said helped reduce gun homicide by 55%. That claim is so odd that even left-wing Mother Jones questioned whether paying people not to shoot others actually reduced crime or whether the city just got lucky.  The Washington Examiner’s David Freddoso noted that a similar program was also tried in Sacramento, “where its promoters boast that ‘only’ 44% of participants were subsequently arrested on new charges — well, as long as you don’t count about one-third of the participants who dropped out or were arrested in its first six months.”  Activist and Reverend Eugene Rivers, another critic of the program, told Fox News that the program was a “gimmick.”  “You do not get young people to turn from crime by generating gimmicks. This is a policy gimmick,” he said. “It’s a bad idea, it’s not a new idea and for many people it’ll be Christmas in September or October.”  The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said Thursday it was ""absolutely the government's business"" to know which Americans haven't been vaccinated yet against the coronavirus.  Responding to GOP criticisms of the Biden administration's planned ""door-to-door"" campaign to encourage unvaccinated Americans to inoculate themselves, Becerra told CNN the government has had to ""spend trillions of dollars to try to keep Americans alive during this pandemic.""  ""So it is absolutely the government's business, it is taxpayers' business, if we have to continue to spend money to try to keep people from contracting COVID and helping reopen the economy,"" he said.  FAUCI'S ‘GET OVER THIS POLITICAL STATEMENT’ COMMENT ON VACCINES GETS PANNED  Becerra said people didn't have to answer the door but he hoped they would so officials could dispel rumors about the vaccine, which has proven to be highly effective in driving down cases, hospitalizations and deaths. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 56% of the adult population has been ""fully vaccinated"" and 67% has gotten at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine.  States that tend to vote Republican have reported lower vaccination rates, and polls show Republican voters are far more likely than Democrats to say they will not or likely will not get the vaccine. The issue has become part of a larger debate over public health measures colliding with Americans' personal freedoms.  Citing concerns over the ""Delta variant"" of the virus, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said this week the door-to-door push is designed to inform people in less vaccinated pockets of the country about where to get the shot and address their concerns about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, she said, adding that it's not up to the federal government to mandate vaccines.

""We can’t just put them in a program without making sure that they have money, without making sure that they have something to take care of themselves.""  Shootings have spiked in the city this year, with 119 recorded gun crime victims in the first half of the year, which is double the number during the same timeframe in 2020.  The program follows a similar one in Richmond, California, which was dubbed ""cash for criminals"" by the media after gun crimes increased. A 2019 study credited the program with helping reduce gun homicides in the city by 55%.  Critics of the program have pointed out that similar initiatives haven't been very successful, with the Washington Examiner's David Freddoso saying in a Wednesday op-ed, ""It was also tried in Sacramento, where its promoters boast that ‘only’ 44% of participants were subsequently arrested on new charges — well, as long as you don't count about one-third of the participants who dropped out or were arrested in its first six months. (D'oh!)""  ""Violent criminals need jail. They do not need cash. People who shoot other people need to be walled off in prisons and kept away from the rest of us,"" he added.  ONE CALIFORNIA CITY IS PAYING PEOPLE NOT TO COMMIT CRIMES  The move comes as California also works to become the first state to pay drug addicts a few hundred dollars to stay sober.  Gov.

The Only Problem Is The Bullet Doesn’t Get To The Place Where It Needs To Be” Dr. Vladimir Zelenko became a hero for his early use of hydroxychloroquine to fight COVID. Sadly, his efforts were halted by a Democrat governor. But Dr. Zelenko didn’t stop. He kept working — and found an over-the-counter way to help people. TRENDING: ""For the First Time We Were All Able to Sing the Star-Spangled Banner Together, We Sang it Loud and Proud"" - Exclusive: Patriots Speak Out from the Inside of DC ""GITMO"" - One Year After January 6 Watch: Here is Dr. Zelenko talk about “the bullet and gun” approach for understanding zinc ionophores (transcript of highlights is below): Dr Zelenko: The Gun & The Bullet, Breaking Down The Protocol And Immune Support Here is a transcript of highlights from the video: Dr. Zelenko: “Zinc is the bullet – it kills the virus. The only problem is the bullet doesn’t get to the place where it needs to be. The virus is inside the cell. The enzyme is inside the cell. And the zinc on its own cannot get into the cell. You have a bullet without a gun – useless. Now, it turns out there’s a class of medications called ‘zinc ionophores’ or a class of substances called ‘zinc ionophores’ — what they do — is they open up a channel, a door, which allows zinc to go from outside the cell to inside the cell. There are four of them that are readily available – two of them are prescription and two of them are over-the-counter. The two prescription ones everyone has heard of: Hydroxycholorquine and Ivermection. They’re the guns that shoot the bullet. The bullet then gets into the cell and stops the virus enzyme from helping the virus replicate. So you have a gun and bullet. Only the synergy of the two creates a functioning unit. S in april of last year, Cuomo issued an executive order that was directly targeting me and my patients – because I was the only one in the state doing it. Where pharmacies would not dispense hydroxychloroquine to patients. So all of a sudden, I had a gun and a bullet approach, but…he took away the zinc delivery system — at least he took away access to my patients. So I was forced by necessity to innovate. I did more research, and on the NIH servers of all places, I found papers saying a substance called quercetin is a zinc delivery system, as well. It’s a zinc ionophore. To be honest, I’d never heard of quercetin. So I googled it and I see it’s over-the-counter. That was one of the most significant realizations in my life and probably in humanity. Why do I say that? Because now there was a cure for tyranny. There are two risk factors for dying from COVID: It’s the doctor you choose and the government you live under. Besides that, there’s no reason a person should die from COVID. Now, you don’t need a doctor and now you don’t need permission from the government. You can go to a pharmacy or go to a supermarket and buy an over-the-counter option of quercetin together with Zinc and Vitamin C and Vitamin D. Together it creates a very powerful immune-boosting nutritional supplement. According to the FDA, I’m not allowed to make any claims except that it’s an immune booster and nutritional supplement. So what I’m going to say is the following: Quercetin and Vitamin C together form a functioning zinc ionophore — a zinc delivery system. Zinc is what it delivers, so you actually need zinc as well. You need the gun and the bullet. And Vitamin D – the studies all show – Vitamin D3 levels between 50 and 70 virtually eliminate hospitalizations or admissions in the intensive care unit. It optimizes their immune system..so you need Vitamin D, then you need Zinc, which is the bullet. And then to form a functioning gun, you need Vitamin C and quercetin… Patients were having trouble sourcing it, because it was four different ingredients that weren’t always available in the same place. They had trouble finding the right doses. It was a puzzle that was a little too complex for people to put together. So I was asked as a necessity — as a favor to people — to produce something that has everything in one package. It made sense to me, so with the help of my colleagues, we were able to produce a substance — a compound called Z-Stack — that has Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and most importantly has quercetin and zinc.” Now, Dr. Zelenko is now making Z-Stack available to everyone.

""If you had a positive COVID test in the past, then you had a 99.3 percent chance of having circulating antibodies against COVID, and those antibodies were present up to 20 months, nearly two years after the infection,"" explained Dr. Marty Makary on ""Washington Watch."" The antibodies could last longer, but ""that's as long as the infection has been around."" For millions of Americans who have recovered from COVID-19, this is good news. But there couldn't be worse news for Dr. Fauci, or as some believe him to be, Science Incarnate. Since early in the pandemic, the National Institutes of Health have discounted natural immunity because, they said, its duration was unknown. That's the public health equivalent of recommending soldiers not carry guns into combat because they might jam unpredictably. Over a year later, the federally-backed funding behemoth still has never bothered to study the question. ""Why am I doing this study,"" asked Makary, a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine & School of Public Health, ""when the NIH has $42 billion and could have done this study instantly?"" He suggested the answer is, ""they don't want to know the results."" The conclusions of the Johns Hopkins study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, are far from ""fringe."" Israeli data have shown natural immunity to be 27 times more protective than vaccines, but Mr. Science ignored that data, preferring instead to extrapolate a policy decision from other Israeli data, released around the same time, which showed booster shots could reduce the risk of hospitalization for older people. ""You cannot cherry pick the science,"" Makary protested. Makary is concerned with the exclusive club of medical experts who are both advising the Biden administration on policy and controlling the purse strings for scientific grants to allow others to conduct research. ""They just talk among themselves,"" he said. A FOIA request has revealed that in October 2020, Fauci colluded with NIH Director Francis Collins to discredit with ""a quick and devastating published take down"" Stanford epidemiologist Jay Bhattacharya and other authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, who advocated for natural immunity and targeted protection for vulnerable groups. Fauci's ilk ""are living in their own bubble,"" Makary said. ""They're not even thinking about an exit of the pandemic."" To determine U.S. policy on natural immunity, they held a ""small vote among some of their experts... The vote was split, and they decided not to recognize it."" Note that this split vote was the ""scientific consensus"" with which dissenting opinions were so ruthlessly de-platformed, ridiculed, and cancelled in the early months of lockdowns. The self-proclaimed experts knew that Americans wouldn't tolerate lockdowns if their flimsy scientific basis was widely known. ""This should not be an oligarchy,"" argued Makary. ""This should be an open scientific debate."" ""The science is now heavily curated,"" continued Makary. ""The CDC's own study on natural immunity... showed natural immunity was three times more protective [against hospitalization] than vaccinated immunity."" But that's not what their conclusion said.

This was due to the country’s “worst-case scenario” epidemic at the time according to officials. Indonesia experienced a spike in COVID-19 infection and deaths in July and was struggling to slow the virus transmission due to its high population.  Indonesia is ranked as the world’s fourth most populous country. The Indonesian government on Thursday (July 15) began distributing free medicine and vitamins to self-isolating Covid-19 patients in high-risk areas as the highly transmissible Delta variant of the coronavirus continued to rip through the country, emptying pharmacy shelves. Each package will have seven days worth of therapeutic Covid-19 drugs and vitamins, and will be given to asymptomatic patients as well as those with mild to moderate symptoms including fever and dry cough. The medication for the latter group will require consultation with a doctor and a prescription. Medical facilities are stretched thin, and demand for oxygen and medication has also soared. As scores of people are isolating themselves at home and self-medicating, prices of drugs have shot up in pharmacies and online. The health ministry has since moved to cap the prices of drugs such as favipiravir, remdesivir and ivermectin. Indonesia’s food and drug agency has authorised ivermectin for emergency use against Covid-19, Reuters reported, although the World Health Organisation, as well as European and the US regulators did not recommend its use for Covid-19 patients. After the government authorized the use of Ivermectin for COVID-19 patients, the number of cases significantly plummeted since July. As of October 8, only 20.5% were fully vaccinated and 35.9% got their first dose. One Twitter user posted a comparison between India and Indonesia’s success with Ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19. The Gateway Pundit previously reported the same scenario in Uttar Pradesh, India. The 33 districts in Uttar Pradesh, India have now become free from COVID-19. The recovery rate has increased up to 98.7% proving the effectiveness of IVERMECTIN as part of the “Uttar Pradesh Covid Control Model.” Of course, the media won’t mention that Ivermectin is being used for the treatment of COVID-19.Uttar Pradesh is the leading state in India to use Ivermectin as early and preventatively in all family contacts. And this state is one of the five lowest COVID cases of all states in India despite having only a low vaccination rate."
263,263,other,"Study: Fully Vaccinated Healthcare Workers Carry 251 Times Viral Load, Pose Threat to Unvaccinated Patients, Co-Workers The Defender is experiencing censorship on many social channels. Be sure to stay in touch with the news that matters by subscribing to our top news of the day. It's free. A groundbreaking preprint paper by the prestigious Oxford University Clinical Research Group, published Aug. 10 in The Lancet, includes alarming findings devastating to the COVID vaccine rollout. The study found vaccinated individuals carry 251 times the load of COVID-19 viruses in their nostrils compared to the unvaccinated. While moderating the symptoms of infection, the jab allows vaccinated individuals to carry unusually high viral loads without becoming ill at first, potentially transforming them into presymptomatic superspreaders. This phenomenon may be the source of the shocking post-vaccination surges in heavily vaccinated populations globally. The paper’s authors, Chau et al, demonstrated widespread vaccine failure and transmission under tightly controlled circumstances in a hospital lockdown in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam. ORDER TODAY: Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s New Book — 'The Real Anthony Fauci' The scientists studied healthcare workers who were unable to leave the hospital for two weeks. The data showed that fully vaccinated workers — about two months after injection with the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (AZD1222) — acquired, carried and presumably transmitted the Delta variant to their vaccinated colleagues. They almost certainly also passed the Delta infection to susceptible unvaccinated people, including their patients. Sequencing of strains confirmed the workers transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to one another. This is consistent with the observations in the U.S. from Farinholt and colleagues, and congruent with comments by the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conceding COVID-19 vaccines have failed to stop transmission of SARS-CoV-2. On Feb. 11, the World Health Organization indicated the AZD1222 vaccine efficacy of 63.09% against the development of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. The conclusions of the Chau paper support the warnings by leading medical experts that the partial, non-sterilizing immunity from the three notoriously “leaky” COVID-19 vaccines allow carriage of 251 times the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to samples from the pre-vaccination era in 2020. Thus, we have a key piece to the puzzle explaining why the Delta outbreak is so formidable — fully vaccinated are participating as COVID-19 patients and acting as powerful Typhoid Mary-style super-spreaders of the infection. Vaccinated individuals are blasting out concentrated viral explosions into their communities and fueling new COVID surges. Vaccinated healthcare workers are almost certainly infecting their coworkers and patients, causing horrendous collateral damage. Continued vaccination will only make this problem worse, particularly among frontline doctors and nurses workers who are caring for vulnerable patients. Health systems should drop vaccine mandates immediately, take stock of COVID-19 recovered workers who are robustly immune to Delta and consider the ramifications of their current vaccinated healthcare workers as potential threats to high risk patients and coworkers."
264,264,other,"No point vaccinating those who’ve had COVID-19: Findings of Cleveland Clinic study Scientists from the Cleveland Clinic, USA, have recently evaluated the effectiveness of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19) vaccination among individuals with or without a history of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The study findings reveal that individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection do not get additional benefits from vaccination, indicating that COVID-19 vaccines should be prioritized to individuals without prior infection. The study is currently available on the medRxiv* preprint server.Background In the United States, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided emergency use authorization for two mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, which have shown high efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease in clinical trials. However, the ability to vaccinate a large part of the global population is limited by vaccine supply. In order to ensure fair access to vaccines throughout the world, the COVID-19 vaccines Global Access (COVAX) initiative was launched. In many countries, especially those with low socioeconomic status, there is a serious shortage of vaccines. Thus, in order to get the maximum vaccine benefits, the most vulnerable population should be prioritized for the vaccination. Currently, most countries prioritize vaccination for healthcare and other frontline workers, elderly people, and people with comorbidities. To further narrow down the prioritization criteria, the scientists in the current study have evaluated the necessity of COVID-19 vaccines for individuals who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Study design The study was conducted on 52,238 employees in the Cleveland Clinic. A positive RT-PCR test was considered to define SARS-CoV-2 infection. The participants received two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at an interval of 28 days. A participant was considered vaccinated after 14 days of receiving the 2nd vaccine dose. Similarly, a participant who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days before the vaccination initiation was considered previously infected. Important observations Of all enrolled participants, 5% had previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared to 59% of non-infected participants, only 47% of previously infected participants were vaccinated by the end of the study. About 63% of all vaccinated participants received the Moderna vaccine. The analysis of cumulative COVID-19 incidence revealed that during the course of the study, SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred almost exclusively in participants who were not previously infected and were not vaccinated. Interestingly, no significant difference in COVID-19 incidence was observed between previously infected and currently unvaccinated participants, previously infected and currently vaccinated participants, and previously uninfected and currently vaccinated participants. The participants from these three groups exhibited a significantly lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to previously uninfected and currently unvaccinated participants. Specifically, of all infections during the study period, 99.3% occurred in participants who were not infected previously and remained unvaccinated. In contrast, only 0.7% of infections occurred in participants who were not previously infected but were currently vaccinated. Importantly, not a single incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed in previously infected participants with or without vaccination.With further statistical analysis, it was observed that the COVID-19 vaccination significantly reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in previously uninfected participants but not in previously infected participants. Although the study did not directly estimate the duration of protection from natural infection, it was observed that previously infected participants remained protected against COVID-19 for at least 10 months after the symptom onset or a positive test result. Study significance The study findings reveal that individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 are less likely to get additional benefits from vaccination. In contrast, individuals without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection can get the maximum benefits from vaccination. Thus, based on the study findings, COVID-19 vaccines should be prioritized to naïve individuals without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
265,265,other,"Italian Institute of Health Drastically Reduces Its Official COVID Death Toll Number The Italian Higher Institute of Health has drastically reduced the country’s official COVID death toll number by over 97 per cent after changing the definition of a fatality to someone who died from COVID rather than with COVID. Italian newspaper Il Tempo reports that the Institute has revised downward the number of people who have died from COVID rather than with COVID from 130,000 to under 4,000. “Yes, you read that right. Turns out 97.1% of deaths hitherto attributed to Covid were not due directly to Covid,” writes Toby Young. Of the of the 130,468 deaths registered as official COVID deaths since the start of the pandemic, only 3,783 are directly attributable to the virus alone. “All the other Italians who lost their lives had from between one and five pre-existing diseases. Of those aged over 67 who died, 7% had more than three co-morbidities, and 18% at least two,” writes Young. “According to the Institute, 65.8% of Italians who died after being infected with Covid were ill with arterial hypertension (high blood pressure), 23.5% had dementia, 29.3% had diabetes, and 24.8% atrial fibrillation. Add to that, 17.4% had lung problems, 16.3% had had cancer in the last five years and 15.7% suffered from previous heart failures.” The Institute’s new definition of a COVID death means that COVID has killed fewer people in Italy than (whisper it) the average bout of seasonal flu. If a similar change were made by other national governments, the official COVID death toll would be cut by a margin of greater than 90 per cent. Don’t expect many others to follow suit though, given that governments have invested so much of their authority in hyping the the threat posed by the virus. For example, behavioral psychologists in the UK worked with the state to deliberately “exaggerate” the threat of COVID via “unethical” and “totalitarian” methods of propaganda in order to terrify the public into mass compliance. And it worked. A survey conducted after the first lockdown found that the average Brit thought 100 times more people had died from COVID than the official death toll. Now we come to understand that the official killed ‘by COVID’ and not ‘with COVID’ figure is less than one tenth what is officially reported as the total COVID death toll. Despite the change, Italy may yet take the decision to make the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory, although how such a scheme would be imposed remains unspecified."
266,266,other,"What is the Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNTV) to prevent a single COVID-19 fatality in kids 5 to 11 based on the Pfizer EUA application? A funny thing happened this afternoon. Not funny as in “haha”. More like funny as in, “ohhhhh that’s how the FDA rigs the process.” I was reading the CDC’s “Guidance for Health Economics Studies Presented to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), 2019 Update” and I realized that the FDA’s woeful risk-benefit analysis in connection with Pfizer’s EUA application to jab children ages 5 to 11 violates many of the principles of the CDC’s Guidance document. The CDC “Guidance” document describes 21 things that every health economics study in connection with vaccines must do and the FDA risk-benefit analysis violated at least half of them. Today I want to focus on a single factor: the Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNTV). In four separate places the CDC Guidance document mentions the importance of coming up with a Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNTV). I did not recall seeing an NNTV in the FDA risk-benefit document. So I checked the FDA’s risk-benefit analysis again and sure enough, there was no mention of an NNTV. Because the FDA failed to provide an NNTV, I will attempt to provide it here. First a little background. The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) in order to prevent a single case, hospitalization, ICU admission, or death, is a standard way to measure the effectiveness of any drug. It’s an important tool because it enables policymakers to evaluate tradeoffs between a new drug, a different existing drug, or doing nothing. In vaccine research the equivalent term is Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNTV, sometimes also written as NNV) in order to prevent a single case, hospitalization, ICU admission, or death (those are 4 different NNTVs that one could calculate). Pharma HATES talking about NNTV and they hate talking about NNTV even more when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines because the NNTV is so ridiculously high that this vaccine could not pass any honest risk-benefit analysis. Indeed about a year ago I innocently asked on Twitter what the NNTV is for coronavirus vaccines. Pharma sent a swarm of trolls in to attack me and Pharma goons published hits pieces on me outside of Twitter to punish me for even asking the question. Of course none of the Pharma trolls provided an estimate of the NNTV for COVID-19 shots. That tells us that we are exactly over the target. Various health economists have calculated a NNTV for COVID-19 vaccines. Ronald Brown, a health economist in Canada, estimated that the NNTV to prevent a single case of coronavirus is from 88 to 142. Others have calculated the NNTV to prevent a single case at 256. German and Dutch researchers, using a large (500k) data set from a field study in Israel calculated an NNTV between 200 and 700 to prevent one case of COVID-19 for the mRNA shot marketed by Pfizer. They went further and figured out that the “NNTV to prevent one death is between 9,000 and 100,000 (95% confidence interval), with 16,000 as a point estimate.” You can see why Pharma hates this number so much (I can picture Pharma’s various PR firms sending out an “All hands on deck!” message right now to tell their trolls to attack this article). One would have to inject a lot of people to see any benefit and the more people who are injected the more the potential benefits are offset by the considerable side-effects from the shots. Furthermore, the NNTV to prevent a single case is not a very meaningful measure because most people, particularly children, recover on their own (or even more quickly with ivermectin if treated early). The numbers that health policy makers should really want to know are the NNTV to prevent a single hospitalization, ICU admission, or death. But with the NNTV to prevent a single case already so high, and with significant adverse events from coronavirus vaccines averaging about 15% nationwide, Pharma and the FDA dare not calculate an NNTV for hospitalizations, ICU, and deaths, because then no one would ever take this product (bye bye $93 billion in annual revenue). Increased all cause mortality in the Pfizer clinical trial of adults As Bobby Kennedy explains, Pfizer’s clinical trial in adults showed alarming increases in all cause mortality in the vaccinated: In Pfizer’s 6 month clinical trial in adults — there was 1 covid death out of 22,000 in the vaccine (“treatment”) group and 2 Covid deaths out of 22,000 in the placebo group (see Table s4). So NNTV = 22,000. The catch is there were 5 heart attack deaths in the vaccine group and only 1 in placebo group. So for every 1 life saved from Covid, the Pfizer vaccine kills 4 from heart attacks. All cause mortality in the 6 month study was 20 in vaccine group and 14 in placebo group. So a 42% all cause mortality increase among the vaccinated. The vaccine loses practically all efficacy after 6 months so they had to curtail the study. They unblinded and offered the vaccine to the placebo group. At that point the rising harm line had long ago intersected the sinking efficacy line. Former NY Times investigative reporter Alex Berenson also wrote about the bad outcomes for the vaccinated in the Pfizer clinical trial in adults (here). Berenson received a lifetime ban from Twitter for posting Pfizer’s own clinical trial data. Pfizer learned their lesson with the adult trial and so when they conducted a trial of their mRNA vaccine in children ages 5 to 11 they intentionally made it too small (only 2,300 participants) and too short (only followed up for 2 months) in order to hide harms. Estimating an NNTV in children ages 5 to 11 using Pfizer’s own clinical trial data All of the NNTV estimates above are based on data from adults. In kids the NNTV will be even higher (the lower the risk, the higher the NNTV to prevent a single bad outcome). Children ages 5 to 11 are at extremely low risk of death from coronavirus. In a meta-analysis combining data from 5 studies, Stanford researchers Cathrine Axfors and John Ioannidis found a median infection fatality rate (IFR) of 0.0027% in children ages 0-19. In children ages 5 to 11 the IFR is even lower. Depending on the study one looks at, COVID-19 is slightly less dangerous or roughly equivalent to the flu in children. So how many children would need to be injected with Pharma’s mRNA shot in order to prevent a single hospitalization, ICU admission, or death? Let’s examine Pfizer’s EUA application and the FDA’s risk-benefit analysis. By Pfizer’s own admission, there were zero hospitalization, ICU admissions, or deaths, in the treatment or control group in their study of 2,300 children ages 5 to 11. So the Number Needed to Vaccinate in order to prevent a single hospitalization, ICU admission, or death, according to Pfizer’s own data, is infinity. ∞. Not the good kind of infinity as in God or love or time or the universe. This is the bad kind of infinity as in you could vaccinate every child age 5 to 11 in the U.S. and not prevent a single hospitalization, ICU admission, or death from coronavirus according to Pfizer’s own clinical trial data as submitted to the FDA. Of course Pfizer likes this kind of infinity because it means infinite profits. [Technically speaking the result is “undefined” because mathematically one cannot divide by zero, but you get my point.] Estimating an NNTV and risk-benefit model in children ages 5 to 11 using the limited data that are available Everyone knows that Pfizer was not even trying to conduct a responsible clinical trial of their mRNA shot in kids ages 5 to 11. Pfizer could have submitted to the FDA a paper napkin with the words “Iz Gud!” written in crayon and the VRBPAC would have approved the shot. They are all in the cartel together and they are all looking forward to their massive payoff/payday. But let’s not be like Pharma. Instead, let’s attempt to come up with a best guess estimate based on real world data. Over time, others will develop a much more sophisticated estimate (for example, Walach, Klement, & Aukema, 2021 estimated an NNTV for 3 different populations based on “days post dose”). But for our purposes here I think there is a much easier way to come up with a ballpark NNTV estimate for children ages 5 to 11. Here’s the benefits model: As of October 30, 2021, the CDC stated that 170 children ages 5 to 11 have died of COVID-19-related illness since the start of the pandemic. (That represents less than 0.1% of all coronavirus-related deaths nationwide even though children that age make up 8.7% of the U.S. population). The Pfizer mRNA shot only “works” for about 6 months (it increases risk in the first month, provides moderate protection in months 2 through 4 and then effectiveness begins to wane, which is why all of the FDA modeling only used a 6 month time-frame). So any modeling would have to be based on vaccine effectiveness in connection with the 57 (170/3) children who might otherwise have died of COVID-related illness during a 6-month period. At best, the Pfizer mRNA shot might be 80% effective against hospitalizations and death. That number comes directly from the FDA modeling (p. 32). I am bending over backwards to give Pfizer the benefit of considerable doubt because again, the Pfizer clinical trial showed NO reduction in hospitalizations or death in this age group. So injecting all 28,384,878 children ages 5 to 11 with two doses of Pfizer (which is what the Biden administration wants to do) would save, at most, 45 lives (0.8 effectiveness x 57 fatalities that otherwise would have occurred during that time period = 45). So then the NNTV to prevent a single fatality in this age group is 630,775 (28,384,878 / 45). But it’s a two dose regimen so if one wants to calculate the NNTV per injection the number doubles to 1,261,550. It’s literally the worst NNTV in the history of vaccination. If you inject that many children, you certainly will have lots and lots of serious side effects including disability and death. So let’s look at the risk side of the equation. Here’s the risk model: Because the Pfizer clinical trial has no useable data, I have to immuno-bridge from the nearest age group. 31,761,099 people (so just about 10% more people than in the 5 to 11 age bracket) ages 12 to 24 have gotten at least one coronavirus shot. The COVID-19 vaccine program has only existed for 10 months and younger people have only had access more recently (children 12 to 15 have had access for five months; since May 10) — so we’re looking at roughly the same observational time period as modeled above. During that time, there are 128 reports of fatal side effects following coronavirus mRNA injections in people 12 to 24. (That’s through October 22, 2021. There is a reporting lag though so the actual number of reports that have been filed is surely higher). Kirsch, Rose, and Crawford (2021) estimate that VAERS undercounts fatal reactions by a factor of 41 which would put the total fatal side effects in this age-range at 5,248. (Kirsch et al. represents a conservative estimate because others have put the underreporting factor at 100.) With potentially deadly side effects including myo- and pericarditis disproportionately impacting youth it is reasonable to think that over time the rate of fatal side effects from mRNA shots in children ages 5 to 11 might be similar to those in ages 12 to 24. So, to put it simply, the Biden administration plan would kill 5,248 children via Pfizer mRNA shots in order to save 45 children from dying of coronavirus. For every one child saved by the shot, another 117 would be killed by the shot. The Pfizer mRNA shot fails any honest risk-benefit analysis in children ages 5 to 11. Even under the best circumstances, estimating NNTV and modeling risk vs. benefits is fraught. In the current situation, with a new and novel bioengineered virus, where Pfizer’s data are intentionally underpowered to hide harms, and the FDA, CDC, & Biden Administration are doing everything in their power to push dangerous drugs on kids, making good policy decisions is even more difficult. If the FDA or CDC want to calculate a different NNTV (and explain how they arrived at that number) I’m all ears. But we all know that the FDA refused to calculate an NNTV not because they forgot, but because they knew the number was so high that it would destroy the case for mRNA vaccines in children this age. Your move CDC — your own Guidance document states that you must provide this number. Update: CDC finally mentions NNTV, but . . . Toward the end of the six-hour CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Nov. 2 meeting where the committee voted to recommend Pfizer’s EUA vaccine for children 5 - 11, there was finally a mention of NNTV. It was on slide 36 of a presentation by CDC official D.r Sara Oliver. Unfortunately the CDC estimate was untethered from reality. I’ll explain: Oliver claimed the NNTV to prevent a single case is 10, even though the best lower bound estimate is 88 and other estimates are 200 or higher (see calculations here and here). Then she claimed the NNTV to prevent a single hospitalization is between 2,213 and 8,187. This is dishonest and a violation of scientific norms. NNTV is calculated by dividing 1 by the Absolute Risk Reduction. There was no Absolute Risk Reduction in hospitalizations in the Pfizer clinical trial in kids 5 to 11, because no one was hospitalized in either the treatment or control group. 1/0 is “undefined” not 8,187. Oliver made no estimate of NNTV to prevent a single COVID-19-related death because that is also undefined (again, there were no COVID-related deaths in the treatment or placebo group in the trial so the absolute risk reduction was zero). Oliver also did not model injuries or deaths from the vaccine (she immuno-bridged from an older age group to show benefits but ignored the reported harms from the vaccine in the older age group). I should also note that my estimates of NNTV were based on CDC data showing 170 deaths from COVID-19-related illness in kids ages 5 to 11 over the last 18 months (I got the number directly from the CDC COVID tracking website). However at the ACIP meeting, the CDC said the number of children in this age group who have died of COVID-19-related illness is 94. If 94 is the correct number to use, then the NNTV to prevent a single death from COVID-19 related illness in this age group would be 28,384,878 / 31 = 915,641. But it’s a two-dose regimen, so if one wants to calculate the NNTV-per-injection the number doubles to 1,831,282. I imagine that at most, half of American parents will be foolish enough to inject this toxic product into their kids. At a 50% uptake rate, the ACIP decision to approve the Pfizer shot will likely kill 2,624 children via adverse reactions in order to potentially save 12 from COVID-19-related illness. Now you know why the CDC did not release the meeting materials prior to the ACIP meeting — they could not stand up to any public scrutiny."

According to a Rasmussen Reports poll, in a race between Trump and Biden in 2024, 51 percent of possible voters said they would vote for Trump, whereas just 41 percent said they would choose Biden. Independent voters would also overwhelmingly choose the GOP candidate, selecting Trump over Biden by 20 points. The gap in a Trump versus Harris election is even bigger, with Trump topping the Vice President 52 percent to 39 percent. Additionally, one-fifth of Democrats said they would pick Trump rather than either Biden or Harris. When survey participants were asked whether or not Trump should run for president again, 48 percent of likely voters said he should run, while 44 percent said he should not. The Rasmussen poll was conducted from September 21-22 and surveyed 1,000 likely voters. President Biden’s approval rating among Americans continues to drop as a number of crises grip the United States, including thousands of illegal immigrants crossing the southern border, Americans stranded in Afghanistan following Biden’s disastrous withdrawal, and looming COVID-19 mandates. According to a recent Gallup poll, the president’s approval sits in negative territory at just 43 percent, dropping 6 points in one month alone. The survey, which was conducted from September 1-17, also showed that Biden has a 53 percent disapproval rate. “Independents have shown the greatest variation in their opinions of how Biden is doing. Biden’s current 37% approval rating among independents is his lowest to date and 24 points below his personal high of 61%. Two-thirds of Biden’s slide among independents since he took office has occurred in the past three months,” Gallup noted in the survey. Former President Trump has hinted that he will run for the White House again in 2024. On Saturday, September 25, Mr. Trump is holding another rally in Georgia as a “continuation of President Trump’s many appearances in support of candidates and causes that further the MAGA legacy and accomplishments of President Trump’s Administration.” On Wednesday, former President Trump wrote in an email provided to American Military News that “we are losing our country.” “We are losing our Country! The Democrats are vicious and fight like hell, and the Republicans do nothing about it. RINOs fight harder against Republicans than they do against Democrats. They want to be so politically correct, even if that means losing our Country, which is happening now,” Trump wrote, later adding, “Remember, the Fake News Media does not report the truth!”"
268,268,other,"Catholic leader whose organization voted to deny Biden communion caught using gay dating app The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) approved a measure last month that could pave the way for the Catholic Church to deny President Joe Biden communion. The conservative bishops hope to prevent Biden from participating in the sacred ritual because of his support for abortion rights. Biden is a devout Catholic who considered becoming a priest in his youth. He rarely misses mass, holds a rosary while making critical decisions, and often quotes scriptures. When asked about the bishops' decision Biden said it is ""a private matter and I don't think that's going to happen."" The bishops hope the new guidance would push ""Catholics who are cultural, political, or parochial leaders to witness the faith."" Monsignor Jeffrey Burrill, the general secretary of the USCCB, has been forced to step down due to some serious allegations about his private life. Burrill, a priest from Wisconsin, worked for the USCCB for the past five years and was elected general secretary last year. ""On Monday, we became aware of impending media reports alleging possible improper behavior by Msgr. Burrill. What was shared with us did not include allegations of misconduct with minors. However, in order to avoid becoming a distraction to the operations and ongoing work of the Conference, Monsignor has resigned effective immediately,"" Archbishop Jose Gomez wrote in a memo to U.S. bishops. The PIllar, a Catholic publication, found evidence that the priest engaged in ""serial sexual misconduct."" An analysis of Burrill's phone found that it was emitting data signals from Grindr, a location-based hookup app, on a near-daily basis during parts of 2018, 2019, and 2020. Grindr is an app designed to bring together gay and bisexual men for sexual encounters. Signals showed that he also visited gay bars and private residences associated with the app. While using an app to meet people for sexual encounters shouldn't be frowned upon, it's a big no-no in the Catholic church. Especially for someone in a leadership position. Friar Thomas Berg, a professor of moral theology at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, New York, told The Pillar that use of such apps is strictly against Catholic doctrine. Berg said that ""according to canon law and the Church's tradition, clerics are obliged to observe 'perfect and perpetual continence,' as a reflection of what should be our lived pursuit of our spousal relationship with the Church and with Christ."" Homosexuality, along with all sexual activity outside of heterosexual marriage, is considered a sin in Catholic doctrine. Burrill appears to be an even bigger hypocrite because the USCCB has opposed LGBTQ equality, same-sex adoption, and the development of an LGBTQ suicide hotline. It has also promoted anti-trans legislation. It always seems to be that the religious folks who judge the harshest always wind up having something to hide. It's a shame that Catholics such as Burrill are forced by doctrine to live their lives in the shadows. But shouldn't that make them more compassionate towards fellow sinners instead of the first to judge?"

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York continues to raise the bar with regard to hyperbolic and absurd statements. Following the Jan. 6 Capitol incursion, in which the congresswoman was never in any apparent danger, she has disclosed she is in therapy. Ocasio-Cortez also compared the experiences of lawmakers on that day to those of troops who have fought in actual combat. During an interview published last week with Latino USA, the New York Democrat spoke extensively about the riot that briefly suspended now-President Joe Biden’s Electoral College certification. That riot was so emotionally scarring, according to AOC, that lawmakers, such as herself, might as well have “served in war” after the legislative process was briefly disrupted. Advertisement - story continues below “It’s politically sensitive. No one wants to discuss, no one wants to say, ‘oh, boo-hoo,’ but there’s members of Congress that, served in war,” she said, before describing how she worried about how safe Capitol employees, such as food service workers, were during the incursion. She then talked about the aftermath of the violence on herself.“After the 6th, I took some time and it was really [Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts], when I spoke to her what happened to me, like the day of, because I ran to her office and she was like, ‘you need to recognize trauma,’” Ocasio-Cortez told the outlet. How bad was that “trauma?” So severe that the second-term Democratic House member said she’s in therapy to cope with the experience. “Oh yeah, I’m doing therapy but also I’ve just slowed down,” she said. “I think the Trump administration had a lot of us, especially Latino communities, in a very reactive mode. And so, I’ve been putting myself in a more practice space.” AOC in fact compared her perception of the Capitol incursion to the death of her father.“I was freezing, but I just felt like I needed to be away from all these people and all of this, like, you know, busyness,” she said.“It’s been so therapeutic… I feel like it’s been one of the most helpful things for me in resetting than almost anything else that I’ve done.” What an insult to combat veterans everywhere. Ironically, AOC wasn’t even in the Capitol building during the riot which she claimed has left her traumatized. The lawmaker was actually in the nearby Cannon building.In a February fact-check in which The Associated Press attempted to prop up AOC’s embellishing the event, the wire service noted the following: “In an Instagram Live video about the riots, she explained that she was in her office in a neighboring building on the Capitol complex, where she experienced a frightening encounter with a Capitol police officer who she said didn’t announce himself.” The AP added: “Ocasio-Cortez’s office is across the street from the main Capitol building, in the Cannon building, which AP reporters on the scene confirmed was evacuated during the riots.” “The Cannon building is also connected to the Capitol building by a series of tunnels, which allow members of Congress to travel between buildings underground,” the AP added. You’d think from hearing AOC speak about Jan. 6 that she was wielding an office chair and fending off MAGA raiders. In fact, her only notable tense interaction with anyone, as far as she has disclosed, was with a cop who knocked on a door to check on her in a separate building. That’s not exactly a harrowing tale of survival. AOC almost certainly belongs in therapy, but it’s difficult to believe her claims that that treatment is rooted in the events of Jan. 6."

Mississippi has recorded 72 fetal deaths in unvaccinated pregnant women infected with the coronavirus, state health officials announced Wednesday, sounding the alarm on the virus’s danger in pregnancy. Speaking during a news conference, Mississippi State Health Officer Thomas Dobbs said those deaths had occurred since the start of the pandemic. The number, which includes only deaths that occurred past 20 weeks of gestation, “is twice the background rate of what would be expected,” he said. “That’s quite a number of tragedies that, sadly, would be preventable right now,” Dobbs said, referring to the availability of vaccines. He said the state is also investigating the deaths of eight pregnant women who were infected with the virus. Those deaths occurred over approximately the past four weeks, during the delta variant-fueled surge, he said. Many underwent emergency Caesarean sections in an attempt to save their babies. Advertisement Citing those cases, Dobbs and other state health leaders urged those who are pregnant to get the shot that can protect them from the virus. “We encourage you to please get vaccinated,” said State Epidemiologist Paul Byers, noting that his daughter had recently delivered a healthy baby after rolling up her sleeve. “That’s going to be the best way to ensure that you and your babies stay healthy.” Research has found that pregnant and recently pregnant women face a higher risk of becoming severely ill from covid-19, with an increased likelihood of requiring hospitalization, intensive care and use of a ventilator. Those who contract the virus in pregnancy are also at greater risk of preterm birth. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month began urging coronavirus vaccination in pregnant women, after studies found no increased risk of miscarriage among those who got the shots. Immunization rates are low in the expectant population, with just 24 percent having received at least one shot, according to the CDC. Advertisement “The vaccines are safe and effective, and it has never been more urgent to increase vaccinations as we face the highly transmissible Delta variant and see severe outcomes from covid-19 among unvaccinated pregnant people,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement last month. In Mississippi, the overall vaccination rate has remained stubbornly low. With just under 40 percent fully vaccinated and 48 percent partially vaccinated, its vaccination rate is second-to-last in the nation. The delta variant has hit hard in the state, where recent weeks have been the worst of the pandemic, according to data compiled by The Washington Post. The average number of infections was hovering at about 2,800, down from the 3,586 recorded Aug. 20, but still far above the numbers seen before this summer. Advertisement Almost 1,300 people were hospitalized, and the state recorded its highest number of deaths in a single day Monday, with 124. Per capita, it is now second in the nation in total coronavirus deaths, at 285. (New Jersey, the leader in deaths per capita, stands at 303.) Dobbs lamented the state’s standing during a live-streamed discussion Friday with Mississippi State Medical Association President Mark Horne, saying that “it doesn’t have to be this way.” “In Mississippi, we’re complacent about being last,” Dobbs said. “Aren’t we? And if you see some folks out there talking, they’re saying, ‘This is inevitable; people are going to die; it’s not worth trying.’ That is a loser mentality, right? Other people don’t do this badly.” He noted that the state recorded almost 900 deaths in August, including 61 people who were between 18 and 31 years old. Advertisement “Not a single one of them was vaccinated,” Dobbs said. “I feel confident, if they had been vaccinated, every single one of those people would be with us today. It’s a stark and painful truth, but it’s just what reality shows.”"

Despite losing seats in November’s elections, Pelosi has doubled down on extremism with her entire caucus unified behind pushing through Joe Biden’s radical agenda. This agenda includes D.C. statehood, new voting laws that will imperial election integrity, sweeping new “domestic terrorism” legislation that would unleash the government on Trump supporters and the illegal immigration disaster. Those positions do not have support according to the survey conducted by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) that shows that Pelosi is by far the most unpopular politician in the country and her party is widely despised. According to a memo released by NRCC, voters in “ticket-splitting” districts that went for Trump; “Democrats in these districts are going to have an uphill battle defending their decisions to vote in lockstep with Pelosi’s socialist agenda.” There is also the matter of the Democrats’ support of the violent race riots that have terrorized Americans most recently seen when Rep. Maxine Waters traveled to Minneapolis to encourage rioting and looting right before the verdict in the George Floyd murder trial and Rep. Rashida Tlab’s call for eliminating the police who she accused of engaging in “government funded’ murder.The poll was conducted across 85 battleground congressional districts also finds that: a majority “do not believe that President Biden’s COVID-19 stimulus is helping them and their family,” that most “do not believe the Democrats’ false promises that Biden’s proposed tax increases will just be on the wealthy,” and that “an overwhelming 75 percent “of voters see the border situation as a crisis or a major problem.” There is also much skepticism over Biden’s out-of-control spending, much of it driven by his big “infrastructure” bill that is less about repairing roads and bridges and more about far-left social engineering, race-based giveaways, and Green New Deal priorities like electric cars. Further adding to Democrats’ woes is the coming loss of House seats in California, New York, and other blue states due to the U.S. Census Bureau’s announcement that population shifts out of the party’s strongholds have resulted in residents fleeing for freer and safer destinations.For the first time ever, Pelosi’s home state has lost a seat. And while it won’t officially shift until after the midterm elections, it marks a trend as California has increasingly become a dystopian, authoritarian hellscape due to decades of ruinous Democrat rule. People are voting with their feet and are leaving in droves to relocate to free states like Florida and Texas which will both get more House seats.
Democrats are going to have a hard time generating the same kind of voter enthusiasm as they did in 2018 and 2020. That could lead to them facing a bloodbath next year that ends Pelosi’s era of legislative terrorism and banishes them from power for a good long time.

However as he was speaking to other physicians, he was not breaking the industry code of conduct.  Gates has three children with his wife Melinda – Jennifer, Rory and Phoebe – born between 1996 and 2002, and according to his former doctor, they are all unvaccinated and healthy.  The news that Bill Gates does not vaccinate his own children, despite being the world’s most active campaigner for mandatory vaccinations, should come as no surprise. Studies prove that the elite do not vaccinate their children. But at the same time they expect the masses to have their children vaccinated.  The elite do not vaccinate  In California, the children most likely to be unvaccinated are white and come from the wealthiest families in Los Angeles, according to a recent study.

That’s about 17,000 of the wealthiest children, out of more than half a million, opting out of receiving vaccinations.  Vaccine exemption percentages were highest in mostly white, high-income neighborhoods such as Orange County, Santa Barbara and parts of the Bay Area, according to CNN.  The study, which was published in the American Journal of Public Heath, looked at more than 6,200 California schools and found vaccine exemptions were twice as common among kindergartners attending private institutions.  “Very rich and privileged parents like the idea of herd immunity, but they don’t want to take the risks associated with vaccinations when it comes to their own children.

It is unprecedented, threatens patients’ dignity and safety — and it is unnecessary.  For me, it’s also illegal. That’s why today, I’m calling — along with think tank the Bow Group — for the British Medical Association BMA to call off its strikes and return to negotiations to bag the settlement we all need.  Savvy tactics from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt led to the Government going in too hard in talks none of us can walk away from.  That’s why a ballot was held.  But even back in November there was no reason why the BMA couldn’t have gone to mediators Acas first before upping the ante.  No one can honestly say that doctors, or the conditions on offer, are the same as what they were when the ballot was called. For me, the strike mandate ended when Acas talks started.  READ MORE:  Corbyn’s mob in doc strike as Momentum sends lefties to join picket line  Strike by junior doctors could drag on ‘for months’, says union boss  Moet medics: High life of docs’ leaders who are heading up NHS strike  Just days before the current talks broke down we all saw BMA reps briefing the media about how badly the whole thing was going.  Union bigwigs close to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn turned up the heat and the talks, naturally, collapsed.  With little chance of Labour returning to power any time soon we are now seeing Corbyn’s “new kind of politics” — a return to direct action to undermine the Government come what may.  His friends inside my union are leveraging the trust and goodwill we’ve spent years building and are weaponising my colleagues and our patients.  There has been no attention given to the victims of recent floods, who have lost so much and had operations cancelled.  With these strikes going ahead it is nonsense to say we can diagnose and treat cancers on time or that we can continue to see those suffering with mental health problems.  And it is nonsense to say the whole profession is behind the strikes — so many grades weren’t even balloted.  There are many different voices saying how many patients may die from understaffing over weekends and over these strikes.  The research I’ve worked on with the Bow Group suggests that more than two hundred lives could be lost just over the three days of industrial action this month.  There is our human side to this debate too. Thousands of us have worked hard to get into medicine.  We see so many patients suffer from their illnesses and are privileged to be there to help them as best we can.  I’ve worked as a doctor since 2005. I see the devastation when an operation is delayed, the anguish when a cancer is picked up late.  Paying me any more or working me any less will never blunt what I see.  Fair wages are fair, and I support the BMA in arguing for them.  Talks collapse ... Dr Stanley blames Corbyn's 'new type of politics' for breakdown  Reuters 1  We all want fair pay through negotiation. But there are many aspects of safety the current talks haven’t even touched upon.  For example, changing our rotas so senior doctors can stay on two weeks more in August — when newly qualified doctors start — would help the new doctors begin their careers in a safer and more supportive environment.  I’m sick of hearing how my colleagues will leave the country if they don’t get all that they want, that they’ll somehow be forced on to a plane to the Great Barrier Reef.  No one is forcing anyone to do anything and we have a debt to repay.  Doctors are one in eight of all NHS staff but we get three-fifths of the training budget.  That’s great, of course, because we really do need the best training to treat you. But why can’t clawbacks be written into our contracts so that if we leave as consultants for warmer climes we must pay back our training?  It takes £400,000 to train a GP — and for surgeons and cardiologists it’s even more.  Two thousand senior doctors leaving the UK would cost us a billion. More than twice that number applied to work abroad just last year.  But with competition for training and for medical school so high, I have to admit we’ve been too easy on those wishing to walk off with the loot.  In fact, if we did close this loophole maybe Jeremy Hunt would have more money to spend on nurses, medicines and, yes, on increasing our pay too.  I have seen emails and briefings from BMA negotiators attacking the Government, calling Hunt a liar, calling for other unions and left-wing groups to join pickets.  I won’t breach confidentiality by publishing these documents, you’ll have to take my word for it.  These briefings are not in my name, and they don’t represent the views of most junior doctors I know.  They make it clear to me there are elements of the BMA that wanted a strike from the moment they got their ballot and have no intention of returning to talks.  Where does that leave the public?  Strikes, I fear, will increase in number and severity.  Maybe, in time for May’s local elections, Corbyn will ride to the rescue and save the day from the strikes he prompted. He may even reward some of his Labour friends inside the profession, but the end result will be a conspiracy against the public and the patients.  I support the BMA, I have been a member for ten years. It does vital work for doctors and, ultimately, serves all of our interests.  But it has allowed a few members with a radical left-wing agenda very different to the union’s own to hijack it.  I will lose friends in calling out this failure to avoid strikes where possible.  I remember my early days of training at Sheffield Medical School and its motto shines through: “The art is long and life is short.”  The standing, trust and legacy of the medical profession is bigger than this showdown — and it has to be. There is a difference between being a professional and an employee. This is an employee dispute, but we are professionals crucial to the life of the nation.  We need to start acting like it.  — Dr Jonathan Stanley is a junior doctor and a member of the Royal College of Surgeons.

278,278,other,"Smoke fags, save lives There’s not much to laugh about these days, but the news that smokers might be protected from Covid-19 is certainly one of them. With study after study showing that smokers are under-represented in coronavirus wards, the renowned French neuroscientist, Jean-Pierre Changeux, is working on a randomised control trial to test the effect of nicotine patches on Covid-19 patients.  These groups are so used to lying with impunity that they wasted no time in asserting that smoking caused coronavirus complications when the pandemic began. In the US, newspapers have been filled with reports that smokers and vapers ‘may’ be at greater risk from Covid-19, a weasel word that requires no evidence. A group of doctors in New York urged governor Andrew Cuomo to ban the sale of all tobacco and e-cigarette products on the false premise that ‘mounting evidence demonstrates the link between tobacco use and increased risk for progressive Covid-19’. Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation has been taking occasional breaks from flattering the Chinese Communist Party to make evidence-free assertions about smokers being ‘likely’ to suffer more from the coronavirus.  This is far from being a crackpot theory. Changeux has explained his hypothesis at length here . In simple terms, he says that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors play a key role in the development of the disease and that nicotine can put a brake on it. If he is right – and the banter heuristic says he is – it would not only save thousands of lives but would also be one in the eye for the ‘public health’ groups who have been claiming that smoking and vaping are risk factors for Covid-19.  Three weeks ago, Public Health England fished around in the emerging literature and found a study from China involving a grand total of five smokers hospitalised with Covid-19, of whom three suffered severe symptoms. From this crumb of evidence, they made the astounding claim that ‘smokers with Covid-19 are 14 times more likely to develop severe respiratory disease’.  A few days earlier, a group of doctors from the Royal Glamorgan Hospital had written to the British Medical Journal to point out that nicotine protects against the kind of acute inflammatory reactions seen in Covid patients and that ‘the simple use of nicotine patches should be urgently considered and discussed’. Nobody paid much attention, but evidence supporting the smoking hypothesis continued to slip out.  Dr Konstantinos Farsalinos of the University of Patras in Greece noticed this phenomenon early on and put a preliminary study online in late March. It noted the ‘unusually low prevalence of current smoking was observed among hospitalised Covid-19 patients’, which ‘does not support the argument that current smoking is a risk factor for hospitalisation for Covid-19, and might suggest a protective role’.  The most comprehensive epidemiological study appeared a week later. Based on data from 4,103 Covid patients in New York City, a team of researchers found that a history of smoking was associated with a 29 per cent reduction in risk of being hospitalised with Covid-19 and, contrary to the claims of Public Health England, smokers were no more likely to become critically ill with the disease if they were admitted. The authors would have found an even sharper reduction in risk for current smokers if they had split them up from ex-smokers in their analysis, but even the findings as published were striking.  On 3 April, the US Centers for Disease Control published data on thousands of American Covid-19 cases. Once again, the proportion of smokers was tiny – just 1.3 per cent. Even ex-smokers were significantly under-represented 2.3 per cent.  This week, a group of French academics published their study of 343 Covid patients , of whom only 4.4 per cent were daily smokers. According to the authors, the study ‘strongly suggests that daily smokers have a very much lower probability of developing symptomatic or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to the general population’. This seems to have been the study that prompted Professor Changeux to go public with his research project.  Far be it from me to preempt the conclusions of the professor’s research, but let us consider for a moment the policy implications of nicotine being the only tried and tested prophylactic for Covid-19. We could issue Lucky Strikes on prescription. We could #ClapForOurCigarettes every Thursday evening. The case for closing down Public Health England would be stronger than ever. We could open the pubs, but only to smokers and vapers. We might allow a few non-smokers in to enjoy the possible benefits of passive exposure, but only if they stand two metres apart. There is everything to play for."
279,279,other,"A 62% Top Tax Rate? It was an accurate and judicious answer, so naturally it sent climate alarmists into paroxysms of condemnation. The Washington Post slammed Pruitt as a “denier” driven by “unreason.” Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii called Pruitt’s views “extreme” and “irresponsible” — proof of his unfitness to head the EPA. Gina McCarthy, who ran the agency under President Obama, bewailed the danger global warming poses “to all of us who call Earth home,” and said she couldn’t “imagine what additional information [Pruitt] might want from scientists” in order to understand that. Replied Pruitt: “No. I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact. So no — I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. But we don’t know that yet. We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis.” ‘Do you believe,” CNBC’s Joe Kernen asked Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency’s new director, in an interview last Thursday, “that it’s been proven that CO2 is the primary control knob for climate?” Yet for all the hyperventilating, Pruitt’s answer to the question he was asked — whether carbon dioxide is the climate’s “primary control knob” — was entirely sound. “We don’t know that yet,” he said. We don’t. CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases. By contrast, carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere: about 400 ppm (parts per million), or 0.04 percent. Moreover, its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm. Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red. A second coat of paint has much less of an effect, while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all. Advertisement There is a popular theory that atmospheric CO2 amplifies the creation of water vapor, thereby increasing warming through a “positive feedback loop.” But that theory so far is mostly speculative; climate projections using models based on it have consistently failed, nearly always predicting far more warming than has occurred. It should go without saying that if scientists cannot yet make accurate predictions about future climate change, then their understanding of climate science remains highly incomplete. Advertisement Earth’s climate system is unfathomably complex. It is affected by innumerable interacting variables, atmospheric CO2 levels being just one. The more variables there are in any system or train of events, the lower the probability of all of them coming to pass. Your odds of correctly guessing the outcome of a flipped coin are 1 in 2, but your odds of guessing correctly twice in a row are only 1 in 4 — i.e., ½ x ½ Extending your winning streak to a third guess is even less probable: just 1 in 8. Apply that approach to climate change, and it becomes clear why the best response to the alarmists’ frantic predictions is a healthy skepticism. The list of variables that shape climate includes cloud formation, topography, altitude, proximity to the equator, plate tectonics, sunspot cycles, volcanic activity, expansion or contraction of sea ice, conversion of land to agriculture, deforestation, reforestation, direction of winds, soil quality, El Niño and La Niña ocean cycles, prevalence of aerosols (airborne soot, dust, and salt) — and, of course, atmospheric greenhouse gases, both natural and manmade. A comprehensive list would run to hundreds, if not thousands, of elements, none of which scientists would claim to understand with absolute precision. Advertisement But for the sake of argument, say there are merely 15 variables involved in predicting global climate change, and assume that climatologists have mastered each one to a near-perfect accuracy of 95 percent. What are the odds that a climate model built on a system that simple would be reliable? Less than 50/50. (Multiplying .95 by itself 15 times yields 46.3 percent.) Is it any surprise that climate-change predictions in the real world — where the complexities are exponentially greater and the exactitude of knowledge much less — have such a poor track record? Pruitt got it right: Measuring human impacts on climate is indeed “very challenging.” The science is far from settled. That is why calls to radically reduce carbon emissions are so irresponsible — and why dire warnings of what will happen if we don’t are little better than reckless fearmongering."
280,280,other,"Relentless' workload forcing 'desperate' teachers to leave profession with big pay cuts Teachers who leave the profession for other jobs are taking substantial pay cuts, a new study published tonight reveals.  The research by the NFER National Foundation for Educational Research looked at teachers who left for different occupations over the past 14 years and found that, on average, their pay dropped by 10 per cent, compared with those who stayed in teaching.  It reveals that some teachers – who left to become teaching assistants or who took up a job in the public sector – saw a drop in their wages of up to 30 per cent.  Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said she knew of a teacher who had become a bus driver because they felt “anything was preferable to the lack of quality of life” that came with teaching.  “The fact that teachers are taking lower paid jobs reflects the desperation that many teachers feel, she said. The relentless nature of the workload and pressure is leading to teachers just walking. They can see no way they can remain in teaching and so they lose professional status and money.”  But the NFER analysis, of the government Labour Force Survey LFS data, can only indicate how the teachers' pay has changed in the short term as the LFS only follows up individuals for one year.  The Should I Stay or Should I Go? report concludes: “The short-term pay benefits from a career move may be limited by the need to prove value to new employers and develop skills for a different career. The prospect of higher pay in the longer-term may still have been a motivation for some teachers who left teaching.”  The report added that it is “possible that career-changers from other professions experience a similar fall in wages and this phenomenon is not likely to be unique to teaching.”  According to the research, more than half 51 per cent of teachers who leave teaching take up jobs in the education sector excluding those who leave to retire.  Carole Willis, NFER chief executive, said: “Recruiting and retaining good quality teachers is a key issue facing the education system over the next five to 10 years. Understanding the types of jobs former teachers are going into and their underlying motivations is crucial for formulating an appropriate policy response.”  The NFER analysed a sample of 6,896 teachers, including 936 who left teaching and 774 who joined teaching, over a 14-year period 2001-2015.

281,281,other,"What is the Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNTV) to prevent a single COVID-19 fatality in kids 5 to 11 based on the Pfizer EUA application? A funny thing happened this afternoon. Not funny as in “haha”. More like funny as in, “ohhhhh that’s how the FDA rigs the process.” I was reading the CDC’s “Guidance for Health Economics Studies Presented to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), 2019 Update” and I realized that the FDA’s woeful risk-benefit analysis in connection with Pfizer’s EUA application to jab children ages 5 to 11 violates many of the principles of the CDC’s Guidance document. The CDC “Guidance” document describes 21 things that every health economics study in connection with vaccines must do and the FDA risk-benefit analysis violated at least half of them. Today I want to focus on a single factor: the Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNTV). In four separate places the CDC Guidance document mentions the importance of coming up with a Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNTV). I did not recall seeing an NNTV in the FDA risk-benefit document. So I checked the FDA’s risk-benefit analysis again and sure enough, there was no mention of an NNTV. Because the FDA failed to provide an NNTV, I will attempt to provide it here. First a little background. The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) in order to prevent a single case, hospitalization, ICU admission, or death, is a standard way to measure the effectiveness of any drug. It’s an important tool because it enables policymakers to evaluate tradeoffs between a new drug, a different existing drug, or doing nothing. In vaccine research the equivalent term is Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNTV, sometimes also written as NNV) in order to prevent a single case, hospitalization, ICU admission, or death (those are 4 different NNTVs that one could calculate). Pharma HATES talking about NNTV and they hate talking about NNTV even more when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines because the NNTV is so ridiculously high that this vaccine could not pass any honest risk-benefit analysis. Indeed about a year ago I innocently asked on Twitter what the NNTV is for coronavirus vaccines. Pharma sent a swarm of trolls in to attack me and Pharma goons published hits pieces on me outside of Twitter to punish me for even asking the question. Of course none of the Pharma trolls provided an estimate of the NNTV for COVID-19 shots. That tells us that we are exactly over the target. Various health economists have calculated a NNTV for COVID-19 vaccines. Ronald Brown, a health economist in Canada, estimated that the NNTV to prevent a single case of coronavirus is from 88 to 142. Others have calculated the NNTV to prevent a single case at 256. German and Dutch researchers, using a large (500k) data set from a field study in Israel calculated an NNTV between 200 and 700 to prevent one case of COVID-19 for the mRNA shot marketed by Pfizer. They went further and figured out that the “NNTV to prevent one death is between 9,000 and 100,000 (95% confidence interval), with 16,000 as a point estimate.” You can see why Pharma hates this number so much (I can picture Pharma’s various PR firms sending out an “All hands on deck!” message right now to tell their trolls to attack this article). One would have to inject a lot of people to see any benefit and the more people who are injected the more the potential benefits are offset by the considerable side-effects from the shots. Furthermore, the NNTV to prevent a single case is not a very meaningful measure because most people, particularly children, recover on their own (or even more quickly with ivermectin if treated early). The numbers that health policy makers should really want to know are the NNTV to prevent a single hospitalization, ICU admission, or death. But with the NNTV to prevent a single case already so high, and with significant adverse events from coronavirus vaccines averaging about 15% nationwide, Pharma and the FDA dare not calculate an NNTV for hospitalizations, ICU, and deaths, because then no one would ever take this product (bye bye $93 billion in annual revenue). Increased all cause mortality in the Pfizer clinical trial of adults As Bobby Kennedy explains, Pfizer’s clinical trial in adults showed alarming increases in all cause mortality in the vaccinated: In Pfizer’s 6 month clinical trial in adults — there was 1 covid death out of 22,000 in the vaccine (“treatment”) group and 2 Covid deaths out of 22,000 in the placebo group (see Table s4). So NNTV = 22,000. The catch is there were 5 heart attack deaths in the vaccine group and only 1 in placebo group. So for every 1 life saved from Covid, the Pfizer vaccine kills 4 from heart attacks. All cause mortality in the 6 month study was 20 in vaccine group and 14 in placebo group. So a 42% all cause mortality increase among the vaccinated. The vaccine loses practically all efficacy after 6 months so they had to curtail the study. They unblinded and offered the vaccine to the placebo group. At that point the rising harm line had long ago intersected the sinking efficacy line. Former NY Times investigative reporter Alex Berenson also wrote about the bad outcomes for the vaccinated in the Pfizer clinical trial in adults (here). Berenson received a lifetime ban from Twitter for posting Pfizer’s own clinical trial data. Pfizer learned their lesson with the adult trial and so when they conducted a trial of their mRNA vaccine in children ages 5 to 11 they intentionally made it too small (only 2,300 participants) and too short (only followed up for 2 months) in order to hide harms. Estimating an NNTV in children ages 5 to 11 using Pfizer’s own clinical trial data All of the NNTV estimates above are based on data from adults. In kids the NNTV will be even higher (the lower the risk, the higher the NNTV to prevent a single bad outcome). Children ages 5 to 11 are at extremely low risk of death from coronavirus. In a meta-analysis combining data from 5 studies, Stanford researchers Cathrine Axfors and John Ioannidis found a median infection fatality rate (IFR) of 0.0027% in children ages 0-19. In children ages 5 to 11 the IFR is even lower. Depending on the study one looks at, COVID-19 is slightly less dangerous or roughly equivalent to the flu in children. So how many children would need to be injected with Pharma’s mRNA shot in order to prevent a single hospitalization, ICU admission, or death? Let’s examine Pfizer’s EUA application and the FDA’s risk-benefit analysis. By Pfizer’s own admission, there were zero hospitalization, ICU admissions, or deaths, in the treatment or control group in their study of 2,300 children ages 5 to 11. So the Number Needed to Vaccinate in order to prevent a single hospitalization, ICU admission, or death, according to Pfizer’s own data, is infinity. ∞. Not the good kind of infinity as in God or love or time or the universe. This is the bad kind of infinity as in you could vaccinate every child age 5 to 11 in the U.S. and not prevent a single hospitalization, ICU admission, or death from coronavirus according to Pfizer’s own clinical trial data as submitted to the FDA. Of course Pfizer likes this kind of infinity because it means infinite profits. [Technically speaking the result is “undefined” because mathematically one cannot divide by zero, but you get my point.] Estimating an NNTV and risk-benefit model in children ages 5 to 11 using the limited data that are available Everyone knows that Pfizer was not even trying to conduct a responsible clinical trial of their mRNA shot in kids ages 5 to 11. Pfizer could have submitted to the FDA a paper napkin with the words “Iz Gud!” written in crayon and the VRBPAC would have approved the shot. They are all in the cartel together and they are all looking forward to their massive payoff/payday. But let’s not be like Pharma. Instead, let’s attempt to come up with a best guess estimate based on real world data. Over time, others will develop a much more sophisticated estimate (for example, Walach, Klement, & Aukema, 2021 estimated an NNTV for 3 different populations based on “days post dose”). But for our purposes here I think there is a much easier way to come up with a ballpark NNTV estimate for children ages 5 to 11. Here’s the benefits model: As of October 30, 2021, the CDC stated that 170 children ages 5 to 11 have died of COVID-19-related illness since the start of the pandemic. (That represents less than 0.1% of all coronavirus-related deaths nationwide even though children that age make up 8.7% of the U.S. population). The Pfizer mRNA shot only “works” for about 6 months (it increases risk in the first month, provides moderate protection in months 2 through 4 and then effectiveness begins to wane, which is why all of the FDA modeling only used a 6 month time-frame). So any modeling would have to be based on vaccine effectiveness in connection with the 57 (170/3) children who might otherwise have died of COVID-related illness during a 6-month period. At best, the Pfizer mRNA shot might be 80% effective against hospitalizations and death. That number comes directly from the FDA modeling (p. 32). I am bending over backwards to give Pfizer the benefit of considerable doubt because again, the Pfizer clinical trial showed NO reduction in hospitalizations or death in this age group. So injecting all 28,384,878 children ages 5 to 11 with two doses of Pfizer (which is what the Biden administration wants to do) would save, at most, 45 lives (0.8 effectiveness x 57 fatalities that otherwise would have occurred during that time period = 45). So then the NNTV to prevent a single fatality in this age group is 630,775 (28,384,878 / 45). But it’s a two dose regimen so if one wants to calculate the NNTV per injection the number doubles to 1,261,550. It’s literally the worst NNTV in the history of vaccination. If you inject that many children, you certainly will have lots and lots of serious side effects including disability and death. So let’s look at the risk side of the equation. Here’s the risk model: Because the Pfizer clinical trial has no useable data, I have to immuno-bridge from the nearest age group. 31,761,099 people (so just about 10% more people than in the 5 to 11 age bracket) ages 12 to 24 have gotten at least one coronavirus shot. The COVID-19 vaccine program has only existed for 10 months and younger people have only had access more recently (children 12 to 15 have had access for five months; since May 10) — so we’re looking at roughly the same observational time period as modeled above. During that time, there are 128 reports of fatal side effects following coronavirus mRNA injections in people 12 to 24. (That’s through October 22, 2021. There is a reporting lag though so the actual number of reports that have been filed is surely higher). Kirsch, Rose, and Crawford (2021) estimate that VAERS undercounts fatal reactions by a factor of 41 which would put the total fatal side effects in this age-range at 5,248. (Kirsch et al. represents a conservative estimate because others have put the underreporting factor at 100.) With potentially deadly side effects including myo- and pericarditis disproportionately impacting youth it is reasonable to think that over time the rate of fatal side effects from mRNA shots in children ages 5 to 11 might be similar to those in ages 12 to 24. So, to put it simply, the Biden administration plan would kill 5,248 children via Pfizer mRNA shots in order to save 45 children from dying of coronavirus. For every one child saved by the shot, another 117 would be killed by the shot. The Pfizer mRNA shot fails any honest risk-benefit analysis in children ages 5 to 11. Even under the best circumstances, estimating NNTV and modeling risk vs. benefits is fraught. In the current situation, with a new and novel bioengineered virus, where Pfizer’s data are intentionally underpowered to hide harms, and the FDA, CDC, & Biden Administration are doing everything in their power to push dangerous drugs on kids, making good policy decisions is even more difficult. If the FDA or CDC want to calculate a different NNTV (and explain how they arrived at that number) I’m all ears. But we all know that the FDA refused to calculate an NNTV not because they forgot, but because they knew the number was so high that it would destroy the case for mRNA vaccines in children this age. Your move CDC — your own Guidance document states that you must provide this number. Update: CDC finally mentions NNTV, but . . . Toward the end of the six-hour CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Nov. 2 meeting where the committee voted to recommend Pfizer’s EUA vaccine for children 5 - 11, there was finally a mention of NNTV. It was on slide 36 of a presentation by CDC official D.r Sara Oliver. Unfortunately the CDC estimate was untethered from reality. I’ll explain: Oliver claimed the NNTV to prevent a single case is 10, even though the best lower bound estimate is 88 and other estimates are 200 or higher (see calculations here and here). Then she claimed the NNTV to prevent a single hospitalization is between 2,213 and 8,187. This is dishonest and a violation of scientific norms. NNTV is calculated by dividing 1 by the Absolute Risk Reduction. There was no Absolute Risk Reduction in hospitalizations in the Pfizer clinical trial in kids 5 to 11, because no one was hospitalized in either the treatment or control group. 1/0 is “undefined” not 8,187. Oliver made no estimate of NNTV to prevent a single COVID-19-related death because that is also undefined (again, there were no COVID-related deaths in the treatment or placebo group in the trial so the absolute risk reduction was zero). Oliver also did not model injuries or deaths from the vaccine (she immuno-bridged from an older age group to show benefits but ignored the reported harms from the vaccine in the older age group). I should also note that my estimates of NNTV were based on CDC data showing 170 deaths from COVID-19-related illness in kids ages 5 to 11 over the last 18 months (I got the number directly from the CDC COVID tracking website). However at the ACIP meeting, the CDC said the number of children in this age group who have died of COVID-19-related illness is 94. If 94 is the correct number to use, then the NNTV to prevent a single death from COVID-19 related illness in this age group would be 28,384,878 / 31 = 915,641. But it’s a two-dose regimen, so if one wants to calculate the NNTV-per-injection the number doubles to 1,831,282. I imagine that at most, half of American parents will be foolish enough to inject this toxic product into their kids. At a 50% uptake rate, the ACIP decision to approve the Pfizer shot will likely kill 2,624 children via adverse reactions in order to potentially save 12 from COVID-19-related illness. Now you know why the CDC did not release the meeting materials prior to the ACIP meeting — they could not stand up to any public scrutiny."

(However), temperature always changes first, and CO2 follows.” Host: (2:39 into the video): “Has there been any global increase in temperature since 1998?” Happer’s clear and simple answer: “No.” Happer (3:48 in): A thousand parts per million (ppm) of CO2 would actually help the planet. How? Because agricultural productivity would go up. Several thousand ppm in greenhouses Happer: “if you look around the world, many greenhouse operators put several thousand parts per million into their greenhouses. Host: “Would there be any negative effects on humans from breathing a trhousand parts per million? Happer: “No, absolutely not.” Our primate ancestors were here roughly 70 to 80 million years ago when CO2 levels were 3,000 parts per million. That’s when we evolved. “So it was ten times what it is now.” Happer: “We also let our sailors in submarines live in atmospheres that are several thousand parts per million.” Glacier Bay glaciers disappeared long before any increase in CO2 Happer (6:20 in): “The glaciers in Alaska’s Glacier Bay are all gone. They disappeared in the 1800s.” Happer: “In fact, that was one of the most famous trips of John Muir. Muir, the founder of the Sierra Club, was visiting Glacier Bay in 1879, and he pointed out all the glaciers were gone.

According to the reports, the girl was taken to the hospital after she complained about stomach pains, couldn’t eat, and had been constipated for five days. The doctor performed a CT scan and reportedly found “unusual spherical shadows,” AKA undigested boba, dotting her colon all the way down her digestive system. According to EBC Dongsen News, the patient reluctantly admitted she had drank a bubble tea five days earlier; however, the doctor who treated her said it would have taken a lot more boba to get to this point. The doctor prescribed laxatives for the girl to get the undigested pearls out of her system. As EBC Dongsen News reports, the director of Zhuji People’s Hospital’s emergency department said that boba, being made of tapioca starch, are already difficult to digest, but some makers also use thickeners and preservatives, the significant consumption of which may lead to gastrointestinal problems.

Five international judges are examining evidence of child rape, torture, murder and kidnapping allegedly done by global elite members of the Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult network. Regular Ninth Circle child sacrifices were said to take place in the catacombs of Catholic Cathedrals, the Vatican, on private estates and groves and government military bases in Belgium, Holland, Spain, Australia, Ireland, France, England and the US. At least 34 child mass grave sites were identified in Ireland, Spain and Canada – and refused excavation by the respective governments, Crown of England and Catholic Church. Named as present in Ninth Circle activities were Pope Francis, former Pope Ratzinger;Anglican, United Church of Canada and Catholic Church officials including Cardinals; members of European royalty including Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip; officials of the Canadian, Australian, UK and US military and governments including the USA’s CIA, plus prominent government ministers, judges, politicians and businessmen from the US, Belgium, Holland, Canada, Australia, France, Ireland and the UK.  Teens were drugged, stripped naked, raped, hunted down in the woods and killed by European royals according to this week’s latest eyewitness to testify before the International Common Law Court of Justice in Brussels. The woman was the fourth eyewitness to give accounts about these human hunting parties of the global elite Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult network. A former member of the Netherlands criminal drug syndicate known as Octopus testified that victims were obtained for these human hunting parties from juvenile detention centers in Belgium and Holland.  “In 2004 I was an involuntary witness to torture, rape and murder sessions of drugged children performed for a group of high ranked people of the Netherlands” stated a woman. “I was taken to a hunting party in Belgium close to Brussels where I saw two boys and a girl ages 14 to 16, hunted and killed by global elites. The human hunting party was heavily guarded by the Netherlands Royal Guards. I was told that King Albert of Belgium was present.”  Four eyewitnesses confirmed that as children and youths they were forced to attend human hunting parties where they and other children were raped, with some killed, and deceased boy’s penises were cut off. Allegedly there was a Dutch countryside palace where boys’ penises were displayed like trophies on a wall. Some hunting parties were hosted on the grounds of Belgium Queen Beatrix’s Palace.  Dutch therapist Toos Nijenhuis claimed that as a four year-old she was forced to witness murders of children that involved former Pope Ratzinger, a Dutch Catholic Cardinal, plus the father of Netherlands Belgium Queen Beatrix and Bilderberger Founder, Dutch Crown Prince Alfrink Bernhard. “I saw the former Pope Joseph Ratzinger murder a little girl? another witness confirmed. “It was at a French chateau in the fall of 1987. It was ugly, horrible and didn’t happen just once. Ratzinger and Bernhard were some of the more prominent men who took part.”  In Ireland, Spain and Canada 34 child mass grave sites were discovered and appeared linked to Ninth Circle activities. The largest was the Mohawk Indian Residential School in Brantford Ontario where child remains were identified in 2008 before the Catholic Church, Canadian government and English Crown shut down the dig by professional archeologists. The 2013 ICLCJ Court had found Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip guilty for the Oct. 10 1964 disappearance of ten native children from the Catholic residential school in Kamloops British Columbia. In the first two weeks of the 2014 court witnesses identified Dutch and Belgian royal participants in the rape and killing of Mohawk children and newborns. Named were Bernhard and King Hendrick, consort to Queen Wilhelmina of Holland.  Alleged to be present during the human hunting parties were the late Prince Johan Friso and his wife Mabel Wisse Smit, former ministers, the top man of the Dutch army, the under secretary of the Raad Van State in the Netherlands, the Vice-Roy next to Queen Beatrix and other global business and political leaders including some from the US. “Surely the present King Willem Alexander and King Filip and their wives know about this abuse and murder of children” said one eyewitness.”They do nothing about it and likely are the ones to stop investigations and prosecutions.”  In January 2014 the brother of the king of Holland Prince Johan Friso passed away in a coma after these three Dutch-language websites shown here reached the internet. The websites revealed that Friso was at the human hunting and killing parties.”The story came on the internet after years of trying to move the policy and justice department in the Netherlands to act against the criminals,” an eyewitness said. “Nobody did anything to stop these criminals, probably because Queen Beatrix and King Albert likely interfered with the investigations.”  Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.  Human hunting parties were said to take place on the grounds of Belgium Queen Beatrix’s Palace in the Netherlands. Two witnesses have named former Pope Joseph Ratzinger and Queen Beatrix’s father the deceased Prince Alfrink Bernhard, as being present at child sacrifices. Both were said to be Nazi sympathizers.  The ICLCJ Court received a collection of Jesuit archival records about a child sacrificial cult known as the Knights of Darkness. In 1933 the Knights were established by the Catholic Jesuits and Nazi Waffen S.S. Division. The records showed Ratzinger was identified as a member of the Knights while working as an S.S. Chaplain’s assistant at the Ravensbruck Concentration Camp in Germany. The records also stated that Ratzinger participated in child sacrificial rites using kidnapped children from the camps or political prisoners.  Another court document called the Magisterial Privilege indicated child sacrifice was a regular occurrence at the Vatican. At the tender age of 12 “Svali” of San Diego County California claimed she was brought to catacombs beneath the Vatican to witness the sacrifice of a three year-old drugged boy. In this video her interviewer said that 24 years prior a “Maria” told him she witnessed another satanic child sacrifice rite in the same Vatican Catacombs.  Last week an Irish police investigator reported to the ICLCJ Court that the close to 800 babies buried in a Catholic Nun’s septic tank were dismembered, decapitated and in bits and pieces – signs that they could have been murdered in Satanic child sacrifice rites. In the last two months the ICLCJ Court has heard these heart-wrenching testimonies about the rape, torture and murder of children as recently as 2010 by Catholic leaders, European royal family members and other global elites. Murder sites of the Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult were said to be in the catacombs of Catholic Cathedrals including the Vatican and on private estates, military establishments and groves in Belgium, Holland, Spain, Australia, France, England and the US.  The ICLCJ Court has been overwhelmed with newly discovered evidence and a number of new witnesses coming forward to testify about Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult activities. They have uncovered Ninth Circle Satanic Cult member possible involvement in international child sacrifice, kidnapping, exploitation and drug rings. The five international judges and 27 jury members were expected to remain in session for at least a year due to the complexity of the cases.  Amnesty has been offered to citizens or employees of the Vatican, Crown of England, churches or governments willing to give sworn testimony or evidence that leads to the prosecution of these global elites suspected of committing crimes. Rewards up to 10,000 euros or around 13,660 dollars was available through the ICLCJ court.

More than 40 million Americans currently have outstanding federal loans, amounting to a whopping total of $1.54 trillion in debt. What did he say? ""We have come to the conclusion that President Biden can undo this debt, can forgive $50,000 of debt the first day he becomes president,"" Schumer announced to supporters outside of his New York office. ""You don't need Congress; all you need is the flick of a pen. ""I have told him how important it is. He is considering it,"" Schumer added after a reporter asked if he had spoken to Biden about the proposal. ""We believe he does [have the executive authority], and he's researching that. I believe that when he does his research, he will find that he does."" During the 2020 Democratic primary, Biden expressed support for a Democratic legislative proposal that would immediately cancel up to $10,000 in debt for each borrower. But since then, progressives in the party have been urging the former vice president to bypass Congress and cancel the debt by executive fiat. Whether it is constitutional for a president to take such an action remains in question. What else? Later during the event, a reporter pressed Schumer on the equity of debt cancelation. ""What about the families that have made sacrifices to pay off the student loans for their students? What about the students who have paid off their student loans?"" the reporter asked. ""Look,"" Schumer responded, ""lots of students paid off student loans, but it's such a burden it's good for everybody to make sure this debt is vanquished."" After the event had concluded, one of individuals standing next to Schumer, mocked the reporter's question, brushing it off as just the ""Fox News perspective"" on the issue. ""These people have great futures, but they are burdened by debt ... we want to remove it,"" Schumer had plainly stated during the event. Yet, despite Schumer's portrayal of debt cancelation as an obvious, kind solution, in reality, it is far from either. As TheBlaze previously reported, contrary to what progressive politicians claim, ""'canceling debt' is not something that actually exists. Lawmakers could remove a borrower's liability for re-paying the debt, but the debt will be shifted onto someone"" and ""in the case of federal student loans, the burden would be further shifted onto taxpayers."""

291,291,other,"Study: Fully Vaccinated Healthcare Workers Carry 251 Times Viral Load, Pose Threat to Unvaccinated Patients, Co-Workers The Defender is experiencing censorship on many social channels. Be sure to stay in touch with the news that matters by subscribing to our top news of the day. It's free. A groundbreaking preprint paper by the prestigious Oxford University Clinical Research Group, published Aug. 10 in The Lancet, includes alarming findings devastating to the COVID vaccine rollout. The study found vaccinated individuals carry 251 times the load of COVID-19 viruses in their nostrils compared to the unvaccinated. While moderating the symptoms of infection, the jab allows vaccinated individuals to carry unusually high viral loads without becoming ill at first, potentially transforming them into presymptomatic superspreaders. This phenomenon may be the source of the shocking post-vaccination surges in heavily vaccinated populations globally. The paper’s authors, Chau et al, demonstrated widespread vaccine failure and transmission under tightly controlled circumstances in a hospital lockdown in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam. ORDER TODAY: Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s New Book — 'The Real Anthony Fauci' The scientists studied healthcare workers who were unable to leave the hospital for two weeks. The data showed that fully vaccinated workers — about two months after injection with the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (AZD1222) — acquired, carried and presumably transmitted the Delta variant to their vaccinated colleagues. They almost certainly also passed the Delta infection to susceptible unvaccinated people, including their patients. Sequencing of strains confirmed the workers transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to one another. This is consistent with the observations in the U.S. from Farinholt and colleagues, and congruent with comments by the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conceding COVID-19 vaccines have failed to stop transmission of SARS-CoV-2. On Feb. 11, the World Health Organization indicated the AZD1222 vaccine efficacy of 63.09% against the development of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. The conclusions of the Chau paper support the warnings by leading medical experts that the partial, non-sterilizing immunity from the three notoriously “leaky” COVID-19 vaccines allow carriage of 251 times the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to samples from the pre-vaccination era in 2020. Thus, we have a key piece to the puzzle explaining why the Delta outbreak is so formidable — fully vaccinated are participating as COVID-19 patients and acting as powerful Typhoid Mary-style super-spreaders of the infection. Vaccinated individuals are blasting out concentrated viral explosions into their communities and fueling new COVID surges. Vaccinated healthcare workers are almost certainly infecting their coworkers and patients, causing horrendous collateral damage. Continued vaccination will only make this problem worse, particularly among frontline doctors and nurses workers who are caring for vulnerable patients. Health systems should drop vaccine mandates immediately, take stock of COVID-19 recovered workers who are robustly immune to Delta and consider the ramifications of their current vaccinated healthcare workers as potential threats to high risk patients and coworkers."

Terry Joe Wilson, 37, was arrested late Tuesday night after a warrant was issued for his arrest last week, The Idaho Statesman reported. Wilson has identified himself online as an associate professor at Boise State University and has been described by the press as the Boise Black Lives Matter chapter spokesman. Both physical and electronic evidence were reportedly used to identify suspects in the vandalism incident, which occurred in February. “[T]he bronze statue of Lincoln in Julia Davis Park — known as ‘Seated Lincoln’ — vandalized with feces, paint and signs,” The Idaho Statesman reported. “Parks and recreation staff were able to clean the statue, which was not permanently damaged.” The suspect fled from officers when he was first approached for his arrest, the Boise Police Department said. When he was tracked down, Wilson was found in possession of a firearm, marijuana, and drug paraphernalia. “Officers chased after Wilson and were able to stop him and take him into custody, at which time Wilson was found to be in possession of a firearm, marijuana and drug paraphernalia,” said a press release from the department. “Wilson was taken to the hospital and was medically cleared before being booked into the Ada County Jail.” “Wilson was charged with several misdemeanor counts, including injuring monuments, ornaments and public improvements, resisting and obstructing officers, possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia,” The Idaho Statesman reported. An account for Wilson describes himself as an associate professor at Boise State University.On Wilson’s Instagram page, one captioned photo from November railing against “fascist Donald Tump and neoliberal Joe Biden” identifies himself as “a student & faculty” at the university. The post, which also includes support for Black Lives Matter, reads as follows: Like the fascist @realdonaldtrump, the neoliberal @joebiden wants to increase police funding despite decades of research to support the position that police do not prevent crime. In-fact policing perpetuates crime & criminality with the support of the courts and corrections. As a student & faculty, I take matters on campus very seriously, not only for the safety of our students, but staff and faculty. The discussion around contemporary policing needs endless improvement, b/c the decision not to impeach current ASBSU President over concerns of anti-blackness under the guise of public safety is an absolute travesty.

The outlines had red smears over where the hearts would be.” The report added: “Terry Wilson II, the spokesperson for the Boise chapter, said in a phone call the demonstration at Clegg’s home was because she was one of the four council members who voted to approve Mayor Lauren McLean’s 2021 budget. The 2021 budget allocates more money for the Boise Police Department, even though the overall budget decreased from 2020. … Wilson said the chapter wanted to hold Clegg accountable for her vote, which he called ‘bad policy.'” More arrests in connection to the vandalism incident are expected to be forthcoming."
293,293,other,"Our NHS is safer in Europe: #NHSsaferIN Our NHS is safer in Europe: #NHSsaferIN  14 Jun 2016, by Frances O'Grady in Public services  Today I’m proud to be joining NHS staff and supporters at a rally at Congress House. We’re coming together to say don’t risk a leave vote – Don’t risk our NHS. And there’s a lot to concern us, whether we work in the NHS or rely on it for our families’ health care.  To start with, there’s the potential loss of so many talented NHS staff from the EU. That could unleash a staffing crisis in the NHS.  Where on earth would our NHS be without all the staff who are so dedicated to it: The doctors, nurses and support staff? The NHS staffing roster includes 50,000 staff from the European Economic Area – including 9,000 doctors, 18,000 nurses and midwives, and over 2,000 other health professionals.  These are people who fill crucial skills gaps, and use their incredible knowledge and expertise to help save British lives.  Of course the government should be investing more in training opportunities for locals. Our government’s NHS bursary cuts have been the worst thing possible in dealing with a growing training crisis.  But migrants don’t clog the NHS up – they prop it up.  Yes, our NHS is at breaking point. Staff are over-worked and services are stretched. But that’s not because of decent, hard-working migrants who pay their way. Migrants are often younger people, less likely to need health services than the average UK citizen but still paying UK taxes to support them.  The NHS is in a staffing crisis because the government has imposed another five-year spending freeze. The Tories’ pay cap has created recruitment and retention problems throughout the service, which means more and more taxpayers money is wasted on agencies and management consultants, increasing our deep reliance on EU healthcare staff.  Across the NHS, staff are demoralized – fed up with too little funding to help the patients they care so deeply about, too many top down reorganisations and not enough ministerial respect. And fed up that their dedication is being taken for granted.  The EU’s Working Time Directive means we have rules that protect staff wellbeing, and don’t needlessly risk patient safety. We already have dedicated health staff putting in long hours, but many Brexit leaders want to overturn their rights to refuse excessive working hours and push them to work even longer.  And of course funding for the NHS depends on Britain’s economy doing well. Pretty much everyone agrees leaving the EU will hit the economy even brexiteers admit it would hurt in the short term, and that will put our crisis hit NHS even deeper in trouble.  Based on IFS analysis, if we leave the EU, the public purse is likely to lose enough money each year to fund the whole of NHS England for 3 months.  Of course not all the public spending cuts would fall on the NHS. But it could still be as much as £10 billion a year by the end of the decade. Equivalent to every hospital trust in England cutting 1,000 nurses and 155 doctors.  But the thing that gets me about the discussion of the NHS in this referendum campaign is the hypocrisy. Because when did the leading lights of Brexit ever give a toss about the NHS?  Does anyone really believe that Boris Johnson cares about the NHS? That’s the same Boris Johnson who is on record saying he doesn’t believe in a free NHS; and that if people paid for services, they’d value them more.  Or Michael Gove who co-authored a book saying the NHS is “no longer relevant in the 21st century”? Or Iain Duncan Smith, who has said he’d prefer a social insurance system? Or even Nigel Farage, who believes that within the next ten years the NHS should be replaced by private health insurance?  I don’t believe they support the NHS as we know and love it, any more than I believe they oppose the EU/US TTIP trade deal. If we came out of the EU, these men would sign us up to their own secret trade deals like a shot. We wouldn’t even know about the deals; let alone have the chance to change them.  But perhaps the Leave campaign’s most shameful fib of all is the claim that leaving the EU would mean more money for the NHS. Frankly, I was gobsmacked when I first saw the Leave campaign’s battle bus slogan.  As the Tory MP and former GP Sarah Wollaston said last week, when she defected from leave to remain: “it simply isn’t true”. Even if we trusted them to do the right thing with the cash, the sums simply don’t add up. They’ve been repeatedly slammed for it by the UK’s statistics watchdog.  The leave campaign are fond of saying we remainers are negative. To be honest when faced with a change that could cause such damage it’s hard not to be. But there are also positive reasons to vote Remain for our NHS.  Being in the EU helps make our NHS better. It means a common set of professional standards across the EU. And when you’re away for work or on holiday, British citizens get the right to free healthcare in other member states.  It also means significant funding for research and development into health. Just last year, the UK received £232 million of EU money – incidentally the largest slice of funding received by any EU member state. That included vital money for research at Great Ormond Street children’s hospital, University Hospital Birmingham and NHS Blood and Transplant services. It keeps the NHS at the forefront of healthcare worldwide.  So we have a choice to make. To build our NHS – or risk it. To back our NHS – or privatise it. And to celebrate and cherish NHS staff – or demonise and divide them. A vote to Leave isn’t just a big gamble with jobs, wages and rights, it’s also a big gamble with our NHS.  The NHS was built by and for working people. It is about solidarity, collaboration and co-operation. And it is too special, too precious, to entrust to the privatising Tories and UKIP, who are pushing Brexit as a way towards a deregulated, low-tax and low-services UK.  The NHS needs to be safeguarded if it’s going to be able to care for our children and grandchildren. I’ll be voting remain to do that."
294,294,other,"Almost 2,400 people declared 'fit to work' were dead within TWO WEEKS We all need to keep in mind that, except for a handful of pollsters, polling is irretrievably broken. So, with a grain of salt and a big, broad smile across my face, I am happy to pass along this CNBC/Change Research poll that shows only three percent — a mere three percent, of President Donald Trump’s supporters see former Vice President Joe Biden as the legitimate winner of the 2024 presidential election. Alternately, far-left CNBC reports that a “staggering 73% of respondents consider Trump the legitimate winner. Another 24% said they are not sure.” Staggering. LOL. Only three percent of “Trump voters believe he should concede to Biden and start the peaceful transfer of power. Another 31% want the president to fight in court until states certify results. Two-thirds, or 66%, think Trump should never concede.” Never concede. LOL. The CNBC write-up contains a number of lies about Trump’s efforts to contest the election and ensure every legal vote is counted. “[T]he poll underscores the potentially bigger harm Trump’s lies about the vote tallies have done to public faith in the electoral process,” CNBC writes without evidence. “The president appears to have convinced many of his supporters he lost unfairly, even as state officials and judges have repeatedly shot down claims of fraud and wrongdoing,” CNBC again says without evidence. The truth is Trump’s legal team has not yet presented what they say is evidence of widespread fraud, enough fraud to overturn the election results. We are only 21 days past the election. Al Gore spent 38 days contesting the 2000 presidential election. Trump has every legal, constitutional, and moral right to ensure the November 3 election was not rigged. Let’s never forget that four blue counties in four swing states — Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Michigan — all stopped counting voted on the night of the election. This is unprecedented and has still not been explain. Before the vote counting stopped, Trump looked like he was on his way to reelection. After the vote counting restarted Will you look at all those Biden votes!I’ve been watching national election late into the night since 1984 — presidential and midterm elections. I have never before seen a state stop counting. With… the poll gets even better… A “vast majority of Trump voters — 81% — said they would not give Biden a chance as president. Only 19% said they would.” Never give Biden a chance. LOL. Why should Trump supporters give His Fraudulency a chance as president when Democrats and the corporate media didn’t give Trump a chance as president, when the Obama/Biden administration repeatedly broke the law with illegal leaks, fraudulent warrants, and illegal unmasking to spy on the Trump campaign and undermine his presidency? And why would we give a chance to a racist like Biden, a credibly-accused rapist and serial liar determined to take away our guns, our free speech rights, wage more pointless wars, raise our taxes, and lock us down for no reason? CNBC claims it polled “1,203 people who voted for Trump in 2020 nationwide from Wednesday to Saturday” with a “margin of error of plus or minus 2.83 percentage points.” Who knows what CNBC really did. Like NBC does with the news, CNBC might have just fabricated this poll out of thin air so they would have a headline. Still, though, LOL. Good for you Trump supporters! #Resist"
295,295,other,"UK faces return to inequality of Thatcher years, says report Pressure on the government to help struggling Britons has intensified after a leading thinktank warned that falling living standards for the poor threatened the biggest rise in inequality since Margaret Thatcher was prime minister.  The Resolution Foundation said Theresa May would need to make good on her pledge to support “just about managing” households as it released a report showing that rising inflation and an end to recent strong jobs growth would hit the least well-off hardest.  Its warnings chime with other forecasts for a squeeze on family budgets on the back of sluggish wage growth, welfare cuts, rising global oil prices and the pound’s sharp fall since the Brexit vote. The drop in sterling has made imports more expensive and there are already signs that is being passed on to consumers, with inflation hitting its highest level for more than two years in December.  The Resolution Foundation’s study found that the current parliament would be the worst for living standards for the poorest half of households since comparable records began in the mid-1960s and the worst since the early years of Thatcher’s 1979-90 premiership for inequality.  Since its sharp increase in the early 1980s – a period of high unemployment, factory closures and a cut in the top rate of tax from 83% to 60% – inequality has broadly remained flat.  But the Resolution Foundation forecast that between 2015 and the next general election in 2020 incomes for the poorest half of households will fall by 2%.  That compares with a rise of 4% during the last parliament and 1% between 2005 and 2010 – the five-year period that included the deepest recession since the 1930s.    Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said: “Britain has enjoyed a welcome mini-boom in living standards in recent years. But that boom is slowing rapidly as inflation rises, productivity flatlines and employment growth slows.  “The squeeze in the wake of the financial crisis tended to hit richer households the most. But this time around it’s low- and middle-income families with kids who are set to be worst affected.  “This could leave Britain with the worst of both worlds on living standards – the weak income growth of the last parliament and rising inequality from the time Margaret Thatcher was in Downing Street.  “The prime minister’s focus on supporting just managing families is absolutely right if we are to avoid the next few years being like the 1980s without the feelgood factor.”  The prediction that inequality is set to start rising again is based on the thinktank’s forecast that while incomes will fall for the poorer half of households they will rise by about 5% for the richest fifth over the next four years.  The foundation blames the upcoming living standards squeeze on a combination of stagnating pay, rising inflation and the rollout of more than £12bn of welfare cuts. It emphasised that the pound’s weakness since the Brexit vote and other economic factors such as flat productivity growth were only part of the picture. The unequal nature of the squeeze would be the result of government policy on tax and benefits.    “The vote to leave the European Union does not, thus far, appear to have impacted on the macroeconomy or employment, but it has hastened the end of ultra-low inflation and increased how far it is likely to rise in the next few years,” the report said.  “But, in some ways regardless of the average level of household income growth, Britain is also actively choosing to increase inequality. Despite welcome policies such as the national living wage, the plans the new prime minister has inherited are likely to ensure that the proceeds of growth are shared unequally and many families made worse off.”    The thinktank sees inequality rising to record highs by 2020 on three different measures: the 90:10 income ratio, which is the income of a household 90% up the income distribution scale, divided by that of a household only 10% of the way up; on the 80:20 ratio, calculated in a similar way from those 80% up the distribution and those 20% up; and on the Palma ratio, the income share of the top 10% divided by the income share of the bottom 40%.  “All forecast measures show large increases in inequality over the next four years, with all reaching record highs by 2020-21. This is a starkly different pattern from the trend of the past 20 years, over which time inequality has been broadly flat or even declining,” the report said.    Underscoring the challenge for May’s government as it seeks to redress deep regional imbalances in the UK, the Resolution Foundation also highlighted persistent inequalities between south-east England and the rest of the country.  Incomes in the vast majority of the country were more than 10% lower than in most wealthy region, south-east England, its analysis found. North-east England and the West Midlands had the lowest levels of income, both 20% lower than in the south-east.  On the capital, the report added: “Contrary perhaps to received wisdom London is not the region with the highest income, and once housing costs are taken into account, incomes in the region are roughly 10% lower than in the south-east.”  A spokesperson for the Treasury said: “Living standards reached their highest ever level in 2015, and are forecast to be higher still by the end of the parliament.    “Millions of people are taking home more of what they earn thanks to the government’s actions to reduce income tax bills and introduce the national living wage. We are helping households with the cost of living by increasing the supply of affordable housing, banning letting agents’ fees, and freezing fuel duty, and our investment to boost productivity will raise living standards in the long run.”  John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the Resolution Foundation was damning: “Labour called on the government at the autumn statement to end the unfair cuts to in work benefits, while they were going ahead with tax giveaways to a wealthy minority, but Philip Hammond chose to carry on with the work of his predecessor.  “It is becoming clearer by the day that working families will be forced to pay for a Tory Brexit that favours the rich and not the rest of us, as our country faces its biggest rise in inequality since Margaret Thatcher.”"
296,296,other,"Bernie makes it official: It’s Biden or bust Last week, in the days leading up to Sanders’ withdrawal and after, the two spoke several times — including Wednesday, when the Vermont senator formally suspended his campaign. Sanders and Biden’s teams have also been in regular communication, with Sanders’ campaign manager Faiz Shakir and senior adviser Jeff Weaver speaking with Biden’s top two advisers, Anita Dunn and Ron Klain. Sanders’ endorsement was no mere formality. Though the Vermont senator formally suspended his campaign last week, Sanders did not say he endorsed Biden, nor did he call on his dedicated followers to vote for his former opponent. Sanders also pledged to hang on to his delegates, which caused some Democrats to fear the primary could wind up repeating the mistakes of 2016, when acrimony marked the relationship between Sanders and Hillary Clinton in 2016. Many Democrats believe that bitter divide played a role in her loss to Trump in November. That rancor between Clinton and Sanders surfaced again this year when the former senator and secretary of state made headlines during the primary for saying “nobody” likes Sanders. But Biden did. He always made sure to be friendly and respectful with Sanders, who repaid the favor — sometimes too much, Sanders advisers fretted when he refused to bludgeon Biden on the debate stage. Even in 2016, Sanders aides note, Biden made sure to praise Sanders when he was anathema to the rest of the Democratic establishment. ""Bernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real. And he has credibility on it. And that is the absolutely enormous concentration of wealth in a small group of people with the middle class being left out,” said Biden in January 2016. ""It's relatively new for Hillary to talk about that.” Biden repeated those words about Bernie’s credibility as he lavished praise on his former rival Monday. Sanders’ endorsement gave Biden a chance to break into the news cycle with a headline-grabbing announcement, a rarity in recent weeks as he, along with Sanders, remains stuck at home during the pandemic as reports about the contagion and the president’s response to it suck up all the media oxygen."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York continues to raise the bar with regard to hyperbolic and absurd statements. Following the Jan. 6 Capitol incursion, in which the congresswoman was never in any apparent danger, she has disclosed she is in therapy. Ocasio-Cortez also compared the experiences of lawmakers on that day to those of troops who have fought in actual combat. During an interview published last week with Latino USA, the New York Democrat spoke extensively about the riot that briefly suspended now-President Joe Biden’s Electoral College certification. That riot was so emotionally scarring, according to AOC, that lawmakers, such as herself, might as well have “served in war” after the legislative process was briefly disrupted. Advertisement - story continues below “It’s politically sensitive. No one wants to discuss, no one wants to say, ‘oh, boo-hoo,’ but there’s members of Congress that, served in war,” she said, before describing how she worried about how safe Capitol employees, such as food service workers, were during the incursion. She then talked about the aftermath of the violence on herself.“After the 6th, I took some time and it was really [Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts], when I spoke to her what happened to me, like the day of, because I ran to her office and she was like, ‘you need to recognize trauma,’” Ocasio-Cortez told the outlet. How bad was that “trauma?” So severe that the second-term Democratic House member said she’s in therapy to cope with the experience. “Oh yeah, I’m doing therapy but also I’ve just slowed down,” she said. “I think the Trump administration had a lot of us, especially Latino communities, in a very reactive mode. And so, I’ve been putting myself in a more practice space.” AOC in fact compared her perception of the Capitol incursion to the death of her father.“I was freezing, but I just felt like I needed to be away from all these people and all of this, like, you know, busyness,” she said.“It’s been so therapeutic… I feel like it’s been one of the most helpful things for me in resetting than almost anything else that I’ve done.” What an insult to combat veterans everywhere. Ironically, AOC wasn’t even in the Capitol building during the riot which she claimed has left her traumatized. The lawmaker was actually in the nearby Cannon building.In a February fact-check in which The Associated Press attempted to prop up AOC’s embellishing the event, the wire service noted the following: “In an Instagram Live video about the riots, she explained that she was in her office in a neighboring building on the Capitol complex, where she experienced a frightening encounter with a Capitol police officer who she said didn’t announce himself.” The AP added: “Ocasio-Cortez’s office is across the street from the main Capitol building, in the Cannon building, which AP reporters on the scene confirmed was evacuated during the riots.” “The Cannon building is also connected to the Capitol building by a series of tunnels, which allow members of Congress to travel between buildings underground,” the AP added. You’d think from hearing AOC speak about Jan. 6 that she was wielding an office chair and fending off MAGA raiders. In fact, her only notable tense interaction with anyone, as far as she has disclosed, was with a cop who knocked on a door to check on her in a separate building. That’s not exactly a harrowing tale of survival. AOC almost certainly belongs in therapy, but it’s difficult to believe her claims that that treatment is rooted in the events of Jan. 6."
298,298,other,"Bill Gates' Former Doctor Says He 'Refused To Vaccinate' His Own Children The physician who served as Bill Gates’ private doctor in Seattle in the 1990s says the Microsoft founder and vaccine proponent “refused to vaccinate his own children” when they were young.  “I don’t know if he had them vaccinated as adults, but I can tell you he point blank refused to vaccinate them as children,” the physician said at a behind closed doors medical symposium in Seattle, adding “They were gorgeous kids, really smart and vivacious, and he said they would be OK as it was, they didn’t need any shots.“  The comments caused a stir among physicians at the symposium with claims he was breaking doctor-patient confidentiality, according to reports. However as he was speaking to other physicians, he was not breaking the industry code of conduct.  Gates has three children with his wife Melinda – Jennifer, Rory and Phoebe – born between 1996 and 2002, and according to his former doctor, they are all unvaccinated and healthy.  The news that Bill Gates does not vaccinate his own children, despite being the world’s most active campaigner for mandatory vaccinations, should come as no surprise. Studies prove that the elite do not vaccinate their children. But at the same time they expect the masses to have their children vaccinated.  The elite do not vaccinate  In California, the children most likely to be unvaccinated are white and come from the wealthiest families in Los Angeles, according to a recent study.  The percentage of kindergartners with state-issued personal belief exemptions doubled from 2007 to 2013, from 1.54% to 3.06%. That’s about 17,000 of the wealthiest children, out of more than half a million, opting out of receiving vaccinations.  Vaccine exemption percentages were highest in mostly white, high-income neighborhoods such as Orange County, Santa Barbara and parts of the Bay Area, according to CNN.  The study, which was published in the American Journal of Public Heath, looked at more than 6,200 California schools and found vaccine exemptions were twice as common among kindergartners attending private institutions.  “Very rich and privileged parents like the idea of herd immunity, but they don’t want to take the risks associated with vaccinations when it comes to their own children. They are worried about adverse reactions including autism.“"
299,299,other,"Budget 2017: National Insurance rate rise criticised Rises in National Insurance Contributions NICS for self-employed workers have been criticised as penalising entrepreneurs.  Chancellor Philip Hammond announced in the Budget that the rate for Class 4 NICS would rise from 9% to 10% in April 2018, and to 11% in 2019.  That compares to 12% currently paid by employees.  The difference in National Insurance Contributions is no longer justified, Mr Hammond said.  Self-employed people have traditionally paid lower NICS than employees, as they receive fewer state benefits.  But the chancellor said the self-employed now had equal access to the new state pension. He also said that the government would consult on parental benefits, some of which self-employed people cannot claim.  The chancellor said all self-employed people who earned less than £16,250 would be better off.  Around half of the 4.8 million workers registered as self-employed earn less than £13,000, according to the think tank the Resolution Foundation.  As a result it said most such workers - such as low-paid hairdressers - will be better off by 2019/20. line Winners and Losers hairdresserimage copyrightGetty Images      A self-employed hairdresser - with average earnings of £12,700 - will be £70 better off       A self-employed taxi driver - with average earnings of £17,300 - will be £20 worse off      A self-employed management consultant - with average earnings of £51,100 - will be £620 worse off.  source: Resolution Foundation line  But the rise, which will cost those affected an average of 60p a week, was criticised by entrepreneurs.  Increasing National Insurance rates for the self-employed could be a further step by the government to penalise those who are taking risks and starting a business, said Lucy-Rose Walker, the chief executive of Entrepreneurial Spark.  Others said it was unfair that the self-employed would have to pay more, when they do not receive the same level of state benefits.  Self-employees are subject to a lower national insurance contribution because they do not receive the same entitlements and benefits as their employed counterparts - such as holiday and sick leave, said Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of tax at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants.

Under Class 2 NICS, self-employed workers pay 2% on qualifying earnings between £5,965 and £8060, amounting to £2.80 a week.  The increase in the NICS rate will raise £145m a year for the Treasury by 2021-22.  Matthew Taylor, head of the Royal Society of Arts, is due to produce a report on how the self-employed are taxed later this year.  He has already said that the Treasury is missing out on millions of pounds, as a result of the workers who have been designated as self-employed.  "
