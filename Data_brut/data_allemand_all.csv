Since the administration of COVID vaccines, medical experts have called for extensive research after deaths and severe side effects occurred. Today, two pathologists present their initial findings in a press conference.  Evaluation of autopsies, case studies, picture documents. Today, September 20, the results of many months of work will be revealed for the first time. Insights into the pathological findings of autopsied COVID-19 vaccinated patients will be given by Professor Arne Burkhardt together with his colleague Professor Walter Lang at a press conference in Reutlingen, scheduled for 4 pm.  In total, the physicians took the deaths of eight deceased under the microscope. Comprehensive results are available for six people, two are not yet evaluated. In five cases, heart muscle inflammations (myocarditis) of varying severity were found. In one person who died after a Moderna vaccination, the pathologists even found microparticles in the lung tissue.  In an ordinary necropsy, the effects of vaccine damage are usually not detectable. There is also no legal requirement in the death certificate that a vaccination status such as that against COVID be queried. According to medical experts, the COVID vaccination is an innovative gene therapy based on an active principle that has not yet been used in human vaccinations. Many physicians criticize the existing studies as insufficient, and the side effects as unexplored.  Since in the past too few autopsies were performed on deaths in connection with COVID vaccinations, pathologists assume a considerable number of unreported cases in which the vaccination against COVID-19 was the cause or at least a contributory cause, as does the chief pathologist at the University of Heidelberg, Professor Peter Schirmacher. According to him, the deaths of 30 to 40 percent of those who died after vaccination could be attributed to the vaccination.  Causes of concern included deaths and severe side effects that occurred after vaccination. According to the EMA, a total of 6,367 deaths and 121,528 serious cases of vaccine side effects have been reported for the European Economic Area as of Aug. 27, 2021. In Germany, more than 131,000 suspected cases were reported to the Paul Ehrlich Institute by the end of July, of which about 14,000 were classified as serious, according to the Aug. 19, 2021, safety report.",Pathologists reveal autopsy results of deceased Corona vaccinees,Other

Are these the same sticks that are being put up our children's noses?  It's basically a sad topic: child labor. Especially in developing countries like India, children often work in factories. In the past, it was mainly in textile production that young children had to work. Today, they are additionally exploited in the big business of Corona.  Video: Children pack chopsticks in Covid test kits This video is currently going viral. A man films children packing Corona test sticks in a confined space. In Indian, he describes what is happening.

And indeed, there are masses of the test sticks - with which we are well acquainted - being hastily transported by the small hands of the children into the common packaging.  Indian children pack chopsticks for tests on other children The hygienic conditions seem alarming. The children sit on the floor in a very confined space. A closer look also reveals insects buzzing around. The chopsticks, which will probably later be introduced into the respiratory tracts of European children, are lying on the floor next to the bare feet of the Indian child workers. The stern voice of at least one adult woman can also be heard. Is she driving the children to work? What the children face if they refuse to work is something you don't even want to imagine.  Parents concerned about dirty test sticks The poor hygienic conditions in which the test kits but also the masks are produced and packaged are also noticeable among end users. As recently as April, many parents were alarmed after examining the test sticks under a microscope or with the zoom of their smartphone cameras.

We think that since this is surgical equipment, it should be healthy. But since most people in China, where most masks are produced, have never thought about the environment, they just use whatever works. There's every piece of dirt in the world in there. Michael Braungart, scientific director of the Hamburg Environmental Institute.  Michael Braungart, scientific director of the Hamburg Environmental Institute, now comments on the subject of masks and talks about a chemical cocktail in front of the mouth and nose.  Mr. Braungart goes into the composition of FFP masks and ""medical masks - OP masks"".  Even though the fleece of most FFP2 masks appears to be paper, it is a thermoplastic: polypropylene.  In addition, there are adhesives, binders, antioxidants, UV stabilizers in large quantities.  In some were also large amounts of formaldehyde or aniline, and then in addition artificial fragrances to mask the unpleasant chemical smell.  In the case of the blue colored surgical masks, cobalt is also usually used as a dye.  All in all, we are wearing a chemical cocktail in front of our nose and mouth, which has never been tested for its toxicity and never for any long-term effects.  And because the chemicals alone don't seem to be enough, we also inhale microfiber particles that are just the right size to lodge in our lungs or travel from there further through the body.  The basic problem: The ingredients of the masks are not affected by the approval. Only the functionality is tested.  If the mask shows sufficient filtering efficiency, it is certified.  And then mainly the older ones also get a letter from the federal government with two vouchers with which they can pick up six masks each at the pharmacy for an additional payment of two euros. Of all things, pharmacies make sure that people get their poison cocktail.  In any case, the masks are not suitable for multiple use. The federal government doesn't seem to realize this, as it only provides the retirees with six discounted masks for two full months.  In the meantime it would be nevertheless a beautiful task for the Federal Ministry of Health to examine times the masks prescribed by federation and countries for their Gesundheitsschädlichkeit. Perhaps Jens Spahn and Lothar Wieler would also like to know what they have in their faces.  And with which long-term damages by the mask regulation our health service may argue then in a few years.

151,176666464897941600954427508969298150442,"Coronaviruses can persist on surfaces at room temperature for up to nine days and remain infectious. On average, they survive between four and five days, a research team from Greifswald and Bochum in Germany writes in the Journal of Hospital Infection. But this is a study of existing scientific literature, not new research on 2019-nCoV.  ""Cold and high humidity increase their lifespan even more,"" Günter Kampf of the Institute of Hygiene and Environmental Medicine at Greifswald University Medical Center said Friday. Since there is no specific therapy against coronaviruses, he said, prevention of infection is important. Like all droplet infections, the virus also spreads via hands and surfaces that are frequently attacked. ""In hospitals, for example, these can be doorknobs, but also doorbells, bedside tables, bedframes and other objects in the direct vicinity of patients,"" Kampf explained.  None of this is new. Together with virologist Eike Steinmann of the Ruhr University in Bochum, Kampf had compiled findings from studies on coronaviruses and their inactivation for a planned technical book. Due to the current situation, they published the scientific facts from their literature research. However, they assume that their findings on other coronaviruses are transferable to the new virus 2019-nCoV. ""Different coronaviruses were studied, and the results were all similar,"" Steinmann explained.  For disinfection, the researchers recommend agents based on alcohol (ethanol), hydrogen peroxide or sodium hypochlorite. If these were used in the right concentration, they drastically reduced the number of infectious coronaviruses within one minute - from one million to just 100 potentially pathogenic particles. If preparations based on other active ingredients were used, they should have at least a limited effect against viruses. ""Usually that is enough to significantly reduce the risk of infection,"" Kampf said. Other researchers had previously advised more frequent hand washing.",Highly infectious and resistant: coronaviruses survive up to nine days on surfaces,Other
167,260614987817271259571031820478490270894,"Study on Corona excess mortality: Did 45 percent die as a result of the lockdown?  A preliminary study by the Hochrhein Clinic in Waldshut-Tiengen proves: There was excess mortality in the spring, but only about half of the deaths were related to COVID-19. Many people apparently died because they did not go to the doctor for fear of infection.  In the fight against the corona crisis, many countries, including Germany, are again relying on a lockdown. But already during the first Corona lockdown, reports accumulated worldwide that the number of patients being treated in emergency medical care had dropped drastically.  Experts feared that health damage and even deaths could result if medical treatment for acute illnesses not related to COVID-19 were delayed or not received at all. This would be the case, for example, if people were reluctant to go to the hospital for fear of infection. This ""collateral damage"" could cause far worse consequences than the coronavirus itself.  A preliminary study by physicians at the Hochrhein Clinic in Waldshut-Tiengen has now analyzed the consequences of the first lockdown for the first time and has now been able to partially confirm these assessments. In the district of Waldshut (165,000 inhabitants) in Baden-Württemberg, 227 people died in April of this year. According to the study, the excess mortality compared to the average from 2016 to 2019 was thus 37 percent. However, of the 62 additional deaths, only 55 percent died with or from COVID-19. As study author Stefan Kortüm explained, the number of inpatient treatments due to complications of chronic diseases decreased by 73 percent during the same period. The researchers suspect that the remaining deaths are what they call ""collateral damage,"" due in part to ""reduced utilization of emergency medical structures."" This ""reduced utilization"" could be explained by the fact that many people stopped going to the doctor for fear of contracting the coronavirus. Kortüm explains that this has led to a worsening of the state of health, especially in chronically ill patients:  In particular, people with acute exacerbations of chronic diseases, such as lung or heart disease, but also tumor diseases, did not seek medical help during this period.  Also particularly tragic is the fact that, compared to previous years, more than twice as many people were apparently found alone and lifeless in their homes. According to the study, ""There was a noticeable increase (at the emergency centers, editor's note) in the alarm keyword ""presumed death"" (+105%). This keyword is used when, upon discovery of a lifeless person, there is clear evidence that the person has been there for an extended period of time or that there are certain signs of death.""  But the increase in ""collateral damage"" can't just be attributed to the fact that people stopped going to the doctor for fear of contracting the virus. The study's findings suggest that contact restrictions and the practice of ""social distancing"" also led to additional deaths. For the elderly in particular, it is often family members and those close to them who are concerned about them and arrange for them to see a doctor. As a result of the fact that seniors hardly ever received visits from relatives, deteriorations in health often went unnoticed.  The medical experts also criticize the fact that all public reporting was and still is focused exclusively on the COVID-19 issue. Other medically relevant topics, they say, have completely faded into the background in the media and thus out of public awareness.  Based on current developments, the authors of the study therefore urgently recommend that crisis communication and media coverage be more balanced so that ""people with acute health problems are not discouraged from seeking the medical help they need."" In addition, the current contact restrictions should be critically reviewed and reduced to a minimum, especially in the private sphere, according to the medical experts.  Editor's note: An earlier version of the article contained some misleading language that suggested the study provided direct evidence of excess mortality from the lockdown. The study authors point out that it is impossible to know exactly what the excess mortality would have been without lockdown. But ""even if causality cannot be demonstrated with absolute certainty, it seems very plausible,"" the study says.

180,335631107940928154472211384267652416325,"An independent study in Italy concludes that the CO2 levels measured under the masks exceed the standard values for indoor air quality in school buildings and even the permitted values in the workplace. The video presentation of the results can be seen here.  Since November 4, 2020, there is a general obligation in Italy to use an oral-nasal mask (MNB for short) on all people over the age of years, both outdoors and indoors, especially for the entire duration of classes, in order to keep the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus in the population at bay. To determine whether the symptoms often complained of by patients, such as poor concentration, headaches, fatigue, difficulty breathing, dizziness, sore throat, were really due to prolonged wearing of an MNB, a multidisciplinary team of experts conducted tests to determine the actual concentration of CO2 under the MNB.  Measurements were taken on 24 healthy subjects of different ages in a seated position (mean 48, range 5-88 years) while breathing. The portable carbon dioxide analyzer G100 from Geotech was used as the measuring instrument (www.geotechuk.com), with a measuring range of 0-20 vol% CO2 (infrared detector), with pump 100 cm3/ min, measuring accuracy 1% of the measuring range. The tube was placed under the nose and the pump was activated at the beginning of inhalation and turned off at the end. The same applies to the measurements during expiration.  Without the mask, the average CO2 value was 3143 ppm (range 2000 - 5,000); with the surgical mask, an average CO2 value of 7292 ppm (range 5000 - 13,000), i.e. 232% of the normal value, was measured.  For FFP2-N95 masks, the average CO2 value was 11,000 ppm (range 7000 - 15,000), 349 percent of normal.  The everyday masks (fabric masks / neck warmers (""hose cloths"") performed particularly poorly with an average CO2 value of 11,500 ppm (range 5000 - 24,000), 365 percent of the baseline value.  The even worse result of the cloth masks compared to the surgical masks is probably due to their lower permeability. Speaking or, worse, singing with MNB further increases the amount of CO2 inhaled and exhaled.  Tables 4-8 of the study report the subjects' results in the different situations (exhalation only, inhalation only, and mixed exhalation and inhalation), with the various MNBs.  The experts conclude that symptoms complained of by patients after prolonged use are likely to be due to the excessive carbon dioxide levels. It is precisely these high levels that are incompatible with optimal oxygenation of the blood.  The experts also examined more than 40 studies on the usefulness of masks and found no evidence of efficacy in preventing respiratory infections when masks were extended to the entire population outside of healthcare facilities. On the contrary, some studies proved how humidity, repeated use of masks and insufficient filtration function promote an increase in infections. A study of thousands of people during a pilgrimage to Mecca found more respiratory infections in the group that wore masks continuously. Dermatological forms such as ""maskne"" (mask acne) occur frequently. There were also phenomena of ""risk compensation"" for a false sense of security generated by the use of the mask. Finally, the increase in breathing resistance and the associated increase in the work of the respiratory muscles (pressure drop) when FFP2 masks are used must be taken into account, he said.  The WHO currently recommends MNB only for a sick person with respiratory symptoms, or in the opposite case, when caring for a sick person: however, this provision can be extended by the respective states. The MNB is useful in the work environment in case of exposure to toxic dusts, in hospital infection departments, or in situations where persons suffering from respiratory infections have to wear the MNB to protect other persons in the same room, and vice versa persons who have to take care of (respiratory infections) sick persons. Thus, it would be important that persons who must work equipped with MNB be trained accordingly, and be allowed regular MNB-free intervals in which they can breathe without one. In conclusion, wearing an MNB can only be recommended for short time intervals, because wearing one is harmful to health.  In addition to the potential for physical harm, the masks are also problematic from a psychological point of view: the mask symbolizes danger; by covering the face, it is difficult to recognize human expressions and emotions in the person opposite. By reducing the recognizable facial surface, emotional contact is reduced, which leads to children - but also adults - becoming weak, fearful, insecure, and subsequently even immunosuppressed, since the psyche is directly related to an adequate immune response. From a psychological perspective, he said, government-imposed health regulations are harmful to healthy children and potentially cause permanent mental disorders. Raising children to fear physical proximity has a detrimental effect on the development of their self-esteem. Furthermore, the fictitious correlation between the possible death of loved ones, although difficult to prove in practice, impedes children's ability to relate to those around them. In adults, too, the use of the mask suggests illness, contagion, and death, and suggests that human proximity means danger, causes psychological discomfort, which in turn contributes to limiting creative functions of the brain. Psychologists observed a dramatic increase in anxiety disorders, feelings of social isolation, panic attacks and suicides.  Dr. Bernhard Oberrauch, architect and building biologist, and Dr. Marco Adami, physicist, conducted the technical investigation. The physicians from various specialties Dr.med. Veronika Dellasega, Dr.med. Roberto Cappelletti, Dr.med. Elisabetta Galli, Dr.med. Bernhard Thomaser, Dr.med. Heike Müller and Dr.med. Maria Paregger elaborated the study and conducted the literature research. The psychologist Dr. Ulrich Gutweniger contributed the evaluation of mask wearing from a psychological point of view.

The facts of the case threaten, if they are not reversed, one of our important cornerstones in the democracy of the Federal Republic of Germany. The freedom of the press, the freedom of reporting.  The most important legal source for public broadcasting in Germany is the Basic Law. With Article 5, Paragraph 1, our constitution created the legal basis for the establishment and continued existence of public broadcasting. With the mandate to reach all people; to reflect and portray all points of view; to ensure that all voices and perspectives are heard. That's what it rightly says on ARD's page on the 70th anniversary of public broadcasting.  Under the responsibility of the Intendantin of the Bavarian broadcasting Dr. Katja Wildermuth, the BR starts the largest attack on the free reporting, since establishment of the ARD 1950. Bavarian broadcasting wants to let in its reporting only vaccinated humans before the camera.  On December 1, 2021, Bayerisches Fernsehen's main production service department sent out an in-house urgent recommendation that only protagonists who have been vaccinated be allowed in front of the camera in outside productions. Shoots should be avoided where there is no control over the vaccination status and behavior of those present. The protagonists are to be informed in advance of a shoot that they must wear an FFP2 mask.  You can see this internal instruction distributed via email here. To protect the recipient, personal references are blacked out. The email consists of two parts. The cover letter and the attachment that was sent along.  To explain, an outside production is anything that does not take place in the studio. So a reportage on location, a street survey, a feed for the news, cultural, social and/or political reporting with a camera team.  That means, after that urgent recommendation, only vaccinated people get to speak on Bavarian television, i.e. this ARD station. Unless the people being reported on in the report are exclusively unvaccinated.  What does this mean for the work of an editor? From now on, an editor of Bavarian television is to allow artists, tissue workers, politicians, scientists and others to speak in their original language only if these persons have been vaccinated. According to the instruction, in logical consequence the editor is to inquire already during his research whether he is dealing with a vaccinated or an unvaccinated person, whereby the latter is consequently denied the right of free expression of opinion on this channel. Furthermore, the editor should not shoot if, in his estimation, he has no control over the behavior of those present as well as their vaccination status.  This means that from now on, critical voices on the political situation will not be heard at Bayerischer Rundfunk if they are unvaccinated. You will now know from every person you see in Bavarian Radio reports who is interviewed on whatever topic that he or she has been vaccinated.  Regarding the meaning of an ""urgent recommendation"" - which is what the letter was circulated as - the Wiesbaden Administrative Court stated in a school ruling on masks: ""The urgent recommendation (of the school) goes beyond a simple request or recommendation.

A causal role of these substances in post-vaccine deaths is suspected and is the subject of further investigation.  A contribution by Edith Brötzner Here is the one-hour video, published via Kopp-Verlag: Instead of continuing to drive people to vaccination, the use of gene-based COVID-19 vaccines should be stopped immediately after these scientific findings are presented. These vaccines can neither protect against viral infection, nor has any positive effect been proven to date. The two professors argue the well-founded suspicion that the vaccines can trigger self-destructive processes, possibly leading to severe illness and even death.  We are physicians seeking the truth. Prof. Sucharit Bhakdi Numerous autopsies performed Prof. Burkhardt provides a summary of his latest histopathological findings in this regard after examining fifteen patients who died within days to months of vaccination. He describes a striking and unique lymphocytic infiltration centered in the blood vessels, but which may involve many other organs, most notably the heart and lungs. For Bhakdi and Burkhardt, these findings point to ""vaccine-induced autoimmune-like pathology.""  The vaccines can lead to self-destructive processes in the body. Prof. Bhakdi, Prof. Burkhardt Kopp Publishing describes the content of the video with the succinct words, ""It is to be expected that such self-destructive processes will have myriads of side effects in all vaccinated individuals, especially after booster vaccinations. Undoubtedly, injection of gene-based COVID-19 vaccines poses a threat to life and limb."" Bhakdi and Burkhardt emphasize that the deaths studied included both mRNA- and vector-based vaccines, as well as the active ingredients from all four major vaccine producers.  All the facts are revealed in this exciting video. Anyone considering getting the booster vaccine should definitely take a look in advance. After vaccination, it may be too late. At the end of the day, we all bear the responsibility for our lives and the lives of our children and the consequences if the sting goes wrong.  Note: In an earlier version of this article, the title read, ""Prof. Bhakdi presents scientific evidence of deadly covid vaccine."" In doing so, we followed the Kopp Verlag's explanations. However, Bhakdi has meanwhile emphasized several times that evidence does not come from him but from pathologists and that the current status is that of a well argued theory, but that further work is needed before definitive proof can be provided.

""We thought the spike protein was a great target antigen; we didn't know that the spike protein itself is a toxin and is a pathogenic protein. So by vaccinating people, we are inadvertently inoculating them with a toxin.""  It's a toxin that can cause cardiovascular damage and infertility, he added.  An associate professor of viral immunology at the University of Guelph, Bridle is no outsider to the cause: He received a $230,000 government grant for research to develop a COVID vaccine. And after looking at the data, he concluded that the spike protein not only resides in the shoulder muscle, where it is injected, but travels to organs throughout the body, including the liver, as well as the spleen, bone marrow, adrenal glands, and in ""fairly high concentrations"" in the ovaries.  Animals in the lab injected with the spike protein developed cardiovascular problems. ""Now we have clear evidence that the vaccines that make the cells in our deltoid muscles produce this protein - that the vaccine itself, plus the protein, gets into the bloodstream,"" Bridle said.

It reacted thereby to a report over the not radiated interview statements of one of its colleagues, a Bestatters from Meissen. He had said: ""Not everywhere where Corona is written on the death certificate, Corona is also in it"". For example, he had spoken with caregivers in nursing homes and learned that even deceased people who had only been in contact with people who had tested positive for Corona, but did not have Corona themselves, were nevertheless included in the statistics for Corona deaths.  The mortician, whose contact information is available, wrote a short letter with various excerpts from death certificates attached: ""I hope that the excerpts somewhat support the statements of the colleague from the crematory."" In response to my reply asking for clarification, he replied, ""I work as a mortician and the death certificates, twice red and once blue, are issued in the home or nursing home.

That's why I'm amazed at the means used to get doctors to add 'covid positive' to the 'normal' causes of death, even though it has nothing at all to do with the death, but is still included in the statistics. Even more astonishing is the fact that old people in the nursing home refuse food according to the death certificate, which is however officially also concealed.  The reason for this, according to the bereaved families with whom I then conduct the mourning discussions, is the loneliness or isolation of the seniors in the homes.

Meanwhile, mainstream media also see the problem. Especially in the scene of creative and self-employed people, the number of cases is rising - hushed up by politics.  No one knows exactly how many people the crisis has driven to suicide. But the numbers must be beyond all dimensions. Morticians, funeral orators and pastors report exploding numbers of cases. Only occasionally do unconfirmed reports emerge that during the first lockdown in Berlin alone, suicide figures were observed that were more than ten times above the normal average for the period under review. No one can be surprised by this.  When, in the summer, AfD members of the Bundestag addressed a small question to the Ministry of Health asking whether the government had the development of suicide rates in the Corona crisis on the screen and was following it, they received the disturbing answer that such surveys were not carried out, one had to rely on the regular figures of the Federal Statistical Office, which would not be published until 2021 for the past year.

He writes of the ""quiet deaths"" caused by suicides of artists he knows: ""The numbers of artists and creative people who have become unemployed, however, are nowhere to be found.

More than 80 percent of respondents with corona symptoms in the study said they wear their face flap all the time or pretty much all the time.  Universal worldwide masking could not only be stunning in the truest sense of the word for the wearer, but apparently even increase likelihood of developing corona symptoms. Back in September, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the previously completely unnoticed study that surveyed COVID-19 patients with symptoms of the disease.  70.6% of respondents said they ""always"" wear a mask, and another 14.4% said they ""often"" wear a mask. This means that a whopping 85% of infected COVID-19 patients had voluntarily made it difficult for themselves to breathe with the supposedly indispensable ""corona protective mask"" and still became infected. 3.9% of those infected reported ""never"" wearing face coverings.  This also suggests that tens of thousands of Americans become infected with COVID-19 every day despite wearing face flaps. Masks do not work; they are not a means to slow or stop the spread. The study also rejects claims by ""Corona experts"" such as U.S. immunologist Dr. Anthony Fauci and others that Americans are not following guidelines disseminated by the CDC and other disease control agencies.  In the screenshot above, the people with symptoms are shown in the left column and the control group is shown in the right. According to The mass illusion, the study provides no evidence that COVID-19 infection protection is associated with mask wearing. In fact, given the lack of separation between the symptomatic group and the control group, it provides evidence that masks do absolutely nothing to stop the spread of COVID-19. The study directly contradicts claims made by CDC Director Robert Redfield in September.

Clearly, the safest way to protect yourself from a virus with a 99.8% recovery rate is to never interact with anyone again, but that's absurd as a long-term life plan.  The vast majority of novel coronavirus transmissions occur at home. There is no evidence anywhere in the world that masks are associated with slowing or stopping COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, there is ample evidence that the wearing of universal masks or mask mandates have innumerable negative effects on society.  Fifteen years ago, the Technical University of Munich concluded after a study that CO2 can only partially escape when exhaled through the surgical mask. ""This effect led to the result that the test subjects breathed in air whose CO2 content was higher than that of the surrounding room air."" This would increase the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood. this information is currently considered a false claim, according to the Robert Koch Institute. ""That one inhales more CO2 is not true, that the breathing is hindered, already"", so a spokeswoman of the RKI. At least one admits there just still that with the long wearing of damp masks to a contamination of the mouth pharyngeal flora with bacteria can come. But so far there are no systematic and comparable studies on the subject.

He comes to a devastating verdict. In his opinion, FFP2 masks are not suitable for wearing at all, because ""what you would pull over your nose and mouth would be hazardous waste,"" he said.  Meanwhile, wearing FFP2 or medical surgical masks has become mandatory in stores and public transportation. Given the highly harmful health ingredients in these masks, it must be questioned why other masks can no longer be worn. The reason for the new mask regulation is said to be due to the ""new virus mutants,"" which are said to be much more contagious than the original coronavirus.  Experts have questioned the protection of masks from spreading viruses from the beginning of the Corona crisis. Even Charité-Christian Drosten once said in an interview that masks would do little to stop the spread of the virus. Nevertheless, medical and FFP2 masks are now to be worn, which the Environmental Institute has found contain ingredients that are highly hazardous to health.  Even though the fleece of the masks appears to be paper, it is actually polypropylene plastic. The various layers are held together with glue, plus binders, UV stabilizers and antioxidants. In addition, researchers at the Hamburg Environmental Institute have found volatile organic hydrocarbons in the masks, most of which come from China.  Every filth in the world in masks In some models, large amounts of formaldehyde (carcinogenic preservative) or aniline (carcinogenic dye) were found, as well as artificial fragrances to mask the unpleasant chemical smell. The blue colored surgical masks also contain the dye and heavy metal cobalt.  Those who wear medical or FFP2 masks are therefore inhaling a dangerous chemical cocktail that is inhaled via the lungs and enters directly into the bloodstream. In addition, the masks contain microplastics and microfibers, which are also absorbed by the lungs and can settle there or travel further through the body from there.  Prof. Braungart of the Environmental Institute criticizes the politicians who would prescribe these ""chemical cocktails with microplastics and microfibers"" to the population. They are working on the basis of completely false assumptions. Just because they are surgical equipment, the masks are by no means harmless.

However, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the risk of transmission in everyday life from laboratory tests alone.  Just one example: Suppose someone coughs into his hand and reaches for a doorknob. Only a fraction of the viruses remain on the door handle. The next person who touches the handle also picks up only a small fraction, spreads it again, and so on. So the viruses thin out very quickly. It is still unclear how many coronaviruses are actually needed to infect someone. It must also be considered that the person must first reach into the eye, nose or mouth with the virus-contaminated hand before the virus can be carried into the body. To date, most experts believe that infections via surfaces are very unlikely.  The study Aerosol and surface stability of HCoV-19 (SARS-CoV-6 2) compared to SARS-CoV-1 Note: This is a pre-published study.  Not all drops are the same In addition, German virologist Christian Drosten points out in the NDR podcast ""Coronavirus Update"" that it is unclear how many viruses were applied to the surfaces in the current lab experiment and how large the drop actually was in the lab. Key. For example, it can be assumed that in everyday life, small residues of saliva and mucus containing viruses can dry up much faster on surfaces - regardless of the surface. This means the virus quickly loses its ability to infect. ""That's why you have to be very careful with scientific data like this. They're not wrong. But they are so simplistic that they probably don't represent the real infection,"" the virologist explains.  The U.S. study also shows that the coronavirus remains active in the air for up to three hours when it attaches itself to air particles. Both Christian Drosten on NDR and virologist Monika Redelberger-Fritz on derstandard.at point out here that respiratory infections are transmitted via heavier droplets. They leave the sick person when coughing or through a moist pronunciation, but then sink back to the ground after ten, twenty, thirty minutes.  This is how you can protect yourself Regularly washing your hands and not touching your face are, of course, further important measures to avoid infection. Regular airing is also recommended.

In a nutshell, it means that rather than boosting your immunity to infection, the vaccine boosts the virus' ability to enter and infect your cells, resulting in more severe disease than if you had not been vaccinated.  This is exactly the opposite of what a vaccine is supposed to do, and a significant problem that has been pointed out from the beginning of the call for a COVID-19 vaccine.  The 2003 Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of Viral Infection and Disease review paper explains it this way, ""In general, virus-specific antibodies are considered antiviral and play an important role in controlling viral infections in a variety of ways. However, in some cases, the presence of virus-specific antibodies may be beneficial. This activity is called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infection.  ADE of viral infection is a phenomenon in which virus-specific antibodies, through interaction with Fc and/or complement receptors, promote viral entry into monocytes/macrophages and granulocytic cells and, in some cases, viral replication.  This phenomenon has been reported in vitro and in vivo for viruses representing numerous families and genera of public health and veterinary importance. These viruses share some common features such as preferential replication in macrophages, the ability to establish persistence, and antigenic diversity. For some viruses, ADE of infection has become a major problem in disease control by vaccination.""  Previous Coronavirus Vaccine Efforts Have All Failed In my May 2020 interview with Robert Kennedy Jr. he summarized the history of coronavirus vaccine development that began in 2002 after three consecutive SARS outbreaks. By 2012, Chinese, U.S., and European scientists were working on SARS vaccine development and had about 30 promising candidates.  Of those, the top four vaccine candidates were then administered to ferrets, the closest thing to human lung infections. In the interview, Kennedy explains what happened next. The ferrets did show a robust antibody response, which is the measure of vaccine approval, but as soon as they were exposed to the wild virus, they all became severely ill and died.  The same thing happened when they tried to develop an RSV vaccine in the 1960s. RSV is an upper respiratory disease very similar to the disease caused by coronaviruses. At the time, they had decided to skip animal testing and go straight to human trials.  ""They tested it, I believe on 35 children, and the same thing happened,"" Kennedy said. ""The kids developed a champion antibody response - robust, durable. It looked perfect [but when] the kids were exposed to the wild virus, they all got sick. Two of them died. They gave up on the vaccine. It was a big embarrassment for the FDA and the NIH.""  Neutralizing versus binding antibodies Coronaviruses produce not one but two different types of antibodies:  Neutralizing antibodies, also known as immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, which fight infection Binding antibodies (also known as non-neutralizing antibodies), which fail to prevent viral infection Instead of preventing viral infection, binding antibodies trigger an abnormal immune response called a ""paradoxical immune enhancement."" Another way to look at this is that your immune system is actually backfiring and not working to protect you, but actually making you sicker.  Many of the COVID-19 vaccines currently on the market use mRNA to instruct your cells to make the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S protein). The spike protein, which attaches to the cell's ACE2 receptor, is the first step in the two-step process viruses use to enter cells.  The idea is that by making the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, your immune system will start producing antibodies without making you sick. The key question is which of the two types of antibodies are produced by this process?  Without neutralizing antibodies, more severe disease is likely In an April 2020 Twitter discussion thread, the immunologist noted, ""In developing vaccines ... and considering immune passports, we must first understand the complex role of antibodies in SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.""  He lists other coronavirus vaccine studies that have raised concerns about ADE.  The first is a 2017 PLOS pathogen study, Enhanced Inflammation in New Zealand White Rabbits When MERS-CoV Reinfection Occurs in the Absence of Neutralizing Antibody, which examined whether infection with MERS would protect the tested animals from reinfection, as is typically the case with many viral diseases. (That is, once you have recovered from a viral infection, such as measles, you are immune and do not get sick again.)  To determine how MERS affects the immune system, the researchers infected white rabbits with the virus. The rabbits became sick and developed antibodies, but these antibodies were not the neutralizing kind, that is, the kind of antibodies that block infection. As a result, they were not protected from reinfection, and when they were exposed to MERS a second time, they became ill again, and more severely.  In fact, reinfection led to increased pneumonia without any associated increase in viral RNA titers,"" the authors noted. Interestingly, this second infection produced neutralizing antibodies that prevented the animals from being infected a third time. The authors stated, ""Our data from the rabbit model suggest that individuals who have been exposed to MERS-CoV and do not develop a neutralizing antibody response, or individuals whose neutralizing antibody titers have decreased, may be at risk for severe lung disease upon re-exposure to MERS-CoV.""  In other words: If the vaccine does not result in a robust neutralizing antibody response, there may be a risk for more severe lung disease if infected with the virus.  And here's an important point: COVID-19 vaccines are NOT designed to prevent infection. As described in the post How COVID-19 Vaccine Trials Are Managed, a ""successful"" vaccine only needs to reduce the severity of symptoms. It is not even about reducing infection, hospitalization, or death rates.  ADE in Dengue Infections The dengue virus is also known to cause ADE. As explained in an April 2020 article published in the Swiss Medical Weekly, ""the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is currently thought to proceed via both direct cytotoxic and immune-mediated mechanisms. An additional mechanism that facilitates viral cell entry and subsequent damage may be what is known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).  ADE is a very well-known cascade of events in which viruses can infect susceptible cells via the interaction between virions complexed with antibodies or complement components and Fc or complement receptors, leading to the amplification of their replication.  This phenomenon is of enormous importance not only for the understanding of viral pathogenesis, but also for the development of antiviral strategies, especially vaccines. (...) There are four serotypes of dengue virus, all of which elicit protective immunity. However, although homotypic protection is long-lasting, cross-neutralizing antibodies to different serotypes are short-lived and can last only up to 2 years.  In dengue fever, reinfection with a different serotype is more severe as the titer of protective antibodies declines. Here, non-neutralizing antibodies override the neutralizing ones, bind to dengue virions, and these complexes mediate infection of phagocytic cells by interacting with the Fc receptor, in a typical ADE.  In other words, heterotypic antibodies at subneutralizing titers are responsible for ADE in individuals infected with a serotype of dengue virus that is different from the initial infection.  Cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies are associated with a decreased likelihood of symptomatic secondary infection, and the higher the titer of such antibodies after primary infection, the longer the delay of symptomatic secondary infection ...""  The paper goes on to detail the results of follow-up studies of dengue vaccine, which showed that hospitalization rates for dengue were higher in vaccinated children under age 9 than in controls. The explanation appears to be that the vaccine mimicked primary infection, and when that immunity wore off, children became susceptible to ADE when they encountered the virus a second time. The author states, ""A post hoc analysis of efficacy trials using an ELISA assay (ELISA) to discriminate antibodies elicited by wild-type infection that occurred after vaccination showed that the vaccine could protect against severe dengue [in] individuals exposed to natural infection before vaccination and that the risk of severe clinical outcome was increased in seronegative individuals.  On this basis, a strategy expert group convened by the World Health Organization (WHO) concluded that only seropositive dengue individuals should be vaccinated if dengue control programs that include vaccination are planned.""  ADE in coronavirus infections This could ultimately be important for the COVID-19 vaccine. Hypothetically speaking: If SARS-CoV-2 acts like dengue, which is also caused by an RNA virus, then anyone who did not test positive for SARS-CoV-2 might actually be at increased risk for severe COVID-19 after vaccination, and only those who have already recovered from an attack of COVID-19 would be protected from severe illness by the vaccine.  To be clear, we do not know whether or not this is the case, but these are important areas of investigation, and the ongoing vaccine trials simply will not answer this important question.  The Swiss Medical Weekly paper also reviews the evidence for ADE in coronavirus infections, citing research showing that vaccinating cats against feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV)-a feline coronavirus-increases disease severity when they encounter the same FIPV serotype as the serotype contained in the vaccine.  ""Experiments have shown that immunization with a variety of SARS vaccines triggered pulmonary immunopathology when it encountered the SARS virus.""  The paper also cites research showing that ""antibodies elicited by a SARS-CoV vaccine enhance infection of B-cell lines despite protective responses in the hamster model."" Another paper published in 2014 found that antibody-dependent infection with SARS coronavirus is mediated by antibodies against spike proteins, ""...higher concentrations of anti-sera against SARS-CoV neutralized SARS-CoV infection, whereas highly diluted anti-sera significantly increased SARS-CoV infection and induced higher levels of apoptosis.  The results of infectivity assays indicate that SARS-CoV ADE is primarily mediated by dilute antibodies against envelope spike proteins rather than nucleocapsid proteins. We also generated monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins and observed that most of them promoted SARS-CoV infection.  Taken together, our results suggest that antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins can induce ADE effects. The data raise new questions regarding a potential SARS-CoV vaccine ..."".  A study that ties into this was published in 2019 in the journal JCI Insight. Here, macaques vaccinated with a modified vaccinia ankara (MVA) virus encoding the full-length SARS-CoV spike protein ended up with more severe lung pathology when the animals were exposed to the SARS virus. And when they transferred anti-spike IgG antibodies to unvaccinated macaques, they developed acute diffuse alveolar damage, likely due to ""distortion of the inflammation-resolving response.""  SARS Vaccine Exacerbates Infection After Infection with SARS-CoV An interesting 2012 paper, tellingly titled Immunization with SARS Coronavirus Vaccines Leads to Pulmonary Immunopathology on Challenge with the SARS Virus, points out, what many researchers now fear, that COVID-19 vaccines may end up making people more susceptible to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections.  The paper reviews experiments showing that immunization with a variety of SARS vaccines resulted in pulmonary immunopathology once challenged with SARS virus. As noted by the authors, ""Inactivated whole virus vaccines, whether inactivated with formalin or beta-propiolactone and whether administered with or without alum adjuvant, showed a Th2 type of immunopathology in the lungs after challenge.  As noted above, immunopathology in two reports was attributed to the presence of the N protein in the vaccine; however, we found the same immunopathologic response in animals given only S protein vaccine, although it appeared to be of lesser intensity.  Thus, a Th2-type immunopathologic response to infection of vaccinated animals occurred in three of four animal models (not in hamsters), including two different inbred mouse strains with four different types of SARS-CoV vaccines with and without alum adjuvant. An inactivated vaccine preparation that does not produce this result in mice, ferrets, and nonhuman primates has not been reported.  Taken together, these experiences raise concerns about human trials of SARS-CoV vaccines. Clinical trials of SARS coronavirus vaccines have been conducted and reported to induce antibody responses and to be ""safe."" However, evidence of safety has been provided for only a short period of observation.  The concern arising from the present report relates to an immunopathologic response that occurs in vaccinated individuals upon exposure to infectious SARS-CoV and is the basis for the development of a vaccine against SARS. Other safety concerns relate to efficacy and safety against antigenic variants of SARS-CoV and to the safety of vaccinated individuals exposed to other coronaviruses, particularly those in the type 2 group.""  The elderly are most vulnerable to ADE In addition to all these concerns, there is evidence that the elderly - who are the most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 disease - are also the most vulnerable to ADE. Preliminary research published in late March 2020 on the preprint server medRxiv reported that middle-aged and older COVID-19 patients have far higher levels of anti-spike antibodies-which in turn increase infectivity-than younger patients.  Immune boosting is a serious concern Another paper worth mentioning is the May 2020 mini-review ""Impact of immune boosting on COVID-19 polyclonal hyperimmunoglobulin therapy and vaccine development."" As in many other papers, the authors point out that:  ""While the development of both hyperimmunoglobulin therapy and vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is promising, both present a common theoretical safety problem. Experimental studies have suggested the possibility of immune-enhanced disease in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, which may thus occur in a similar manner in SARS-CoV-2 infection ... Immune enhancement of disease can theoretically occur in two ways. First, nonneutralizing or subneutralizing amounts of antibodies may amplify SARS-CoV-2 infection in target cells. Second, antibodies could increase inflammation and thus the severity of lung disease. An overview of these antibody-dependent infection and immunopathological enhancement effects is summarized in Fig. 1 ... Currently, several SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccine candidates are in preclinical or early clinical trials. Animal studies of these CoVs have shown that the S protein-based vaccines (particularly the receptor binding domain, RBD) are highly immunogenic and protective against challenge by wild-type CoVs.  Vaccines that target other parts of the virus, such as the nucleocapsid, without the S protein have not shown protection against CoV infection and increased lung pathology. However, immunization with some S protein-based CoV vaccines has also shown evidence of increased lung pathology after infection with the virus.  Thus, in addition to the choice of antigen target, vaccine efficacy and risk of immunopathology may depend on other additional factors, including the formulation of the adjuvant, age at time of vaccination ... and route of immunization.""  Mechanism of ADE and antibody-mediated immunopathology.  Left panel: in ADE, internalization of the immune complex is mediated by the involvement of activating Fc receptors on the cell surface. Coligation of inhibitory receptors then leads to inhibition of antiviral responses, resulting in increased viral replication.  Right panel: antibodies can cause immunopathology by activating the complement pathway or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In both pathways, excessive immune activation leads to the release of cytokines and chemokines, resulting in increased disease pathology.  Do a Risk-Benefit Analysis Before Deciding In all likelihood, regardless of how effective (or ineffective) the COVID-19 vaccines ultimately will be, they will be released to the public in a relatively short time. Most predict that one or more vaccines will be ready sometime in 2021.  Ironically, the data¹ we have now² no longer support a mass vaccination mandate³, considering that COVID-19's lethality for people under 60 is lower than that of influenza. If you are under 40 years old, your risk of dying from COVID-19 is only 0.01%, which means you have a 99.99% chance of surviving the infection. And you could improve this to 99.999% if you are metabolically flexible and rich in vitamin D.  So really, what are we protecting against with a vaccine against COVID-19? As mentioned earlier, vaccines aren't even designed to prevent infection, only to reduce the severity of symptoms. In the meantime, they could potentially make you sicker once you are exposed to the virus. That seems like a big risk for a really questionable benefit.  To go back to where we started: Participants in the ongoing COVID-19 vaccine trials are not being told about this risk - that the vaccine may give them more severe COVID-19 after they are infected with the virus.  Lethal Th2 immunopathology is another potential risk Finally, think about what the PNAS information says about the risk of vaccine-induced immune system amplification and dysfunction, especially for the elderly, the very people who would need the protection a vaccine could provide most:  ""Since the 1960s, tests of vaccine candidates for diseases such as dengue, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have shown a paradoxical phenomenon: some animals or humans who received the vaccine and were later exposed to the virus developed more severe disease than those who had not been vaccinated. The vaccine-supported immune system appeared to trigger the wrong response to the natural infection in certain cases ... This immune system rebound, known as immune enhancement, can manifest itself in a variety of ways, including antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a process in which a virus uses antibodies to support infection, or cell-based enhancement, a category that includes allergic inflammation caused by Th2 immunopathology. In some cases, the enhancement processes may overlap... Some researchers argue that ADE, although it has received the most attention to date, is less likely to occur than a dysregulated response to COVID-19 through other pathways of immune enhancement, given what is known about the epidemiology of the virus and its behavior in the human body.  ""ADE can arise, but the bigger problem is probably Th2 immunopathology,"" says Ralph Baric, an epidemiologist and expert on coronaviruses ... at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Previous SARS studies have found aged mice to be at particularly high risk of life-threatening Th2 immunopathology, ... in which a defective T-cell response triggers allergic inflammation and poorly functioning antibodies that form immune complexes, activate the complement system, and potentially damage the airways.""",Huge scandal uncovered: Covid-19 vaccination permanently destroys our immune system,Other
330,226553107081951434337044595594801199005,"By Christian Euler Whether thrombosis, heart disease, brain damage or reproductive problems: Reports of side effects from Corona vaccinations are piling up. Now, evidence is mounting for an explanation that is as conclusive as it is ominous: the so-called spike proteins that enter the bloodstream.  ""We made a big mistake and didn't realize it until now,"" Canadian vaccine researcher Byram Bridle recently confessed in an interview with Canadian journalist Alex Pierson. If he previously assumed that the spike protein was a ""unique target antigen,"" the immunologist and associate professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario recently did the roll backwards: ""We didn't know that the spike protein itself is a toxin and is a pathogenic protein. We are inadvertently vaccinating people with a toxin.""  The original idea was to use vaccination to cause the formation of coronavirus spines (spikes) - but without virus - anywhere in the bodies of those vaccinated. This was supposed to trigger an immune response against the protein and prevent it from infecting cells.  Spike proteins circulate in the blood for several days Back in February, a scientific paper involving the head of the Paul Ehrlich Institute, Klaus Cichutek, indicated that spike proteins can cause neighboring cells to stick together or merge. In this way, the authors say, clumps of up to a hundred fused cells could form and die in the process. This can lead to severe tissue damage and destruction, microthrombosis, and secondary immune complications.  By loading the video, you accept YouTube's privacy policy.  Learn More Download Video YouTube Always Unlock Now the belated insight of immunologist Byram Bridle, who last year was awarded a $230,000 grant by the Canadian government for research to develop the COVID vaccine.  ""Very concerning"" to him, meanwhile, is not just the toxic effects of the inoculated spike proteins. In addition, he is concerned that they do not remain primarily at the vaccination site on the shoulder muscle, as previously thought. For example, Japanese studies would show that the spike proteins enter the blood, where they circulate for several days after vaccination and then accumulate in organs and tissues such as the spleen, bone marrow, liver, adrenal glands, and in ""quite high concentrations"" in the ovaries.  ""It's a toxin, and it can do damage in our bodies if it gets into the circulation,"" Bridle warns. He says science has found that the spike protein alone is almost entirely responsible for damage to the cardiovascular system when it enters the circulation. ""Now we have clear evidence that vaccines produce this protein and that the vaccine itself, along with the protein, gets into the bloodstream.""  Serious consequences also to be expected in children That Bridle will thus not be admitted to the box of the aluhut carriers is shown not least by the fact that laboratory animals injected with purified spike proteins developed cardiovascular problems. At the same time, according to ""Nature,"" it has been demonstrated that the spike proteins cross the blood-brain barrier and cause damage to the brain.  The dangers seem enormous: According to Bridle, scientific studies indicate that infants whose mothers had been vaccinated were at risk of getting spike proteins through their mother's milk. He also sees serious consequences in people for whom coronavirus is not a high-risk pathogen.  ""That includes all of our children,"" the immunologist said. Finally, he raises the nightmarish question, ""Are we going to make young people infertile?"" Not to mention blood disorders, miscarriages in vaccinated pregnant women, and menstrual disorders in women.  Bridle knows he lives in times when, as a scientific public servant, he can no longer answer people's questions honestly without fear of being harassed and intimidated. But he shows backbone: ""However, it is not in my nature to allow scientific facts to be hidden from the public.""  If this were another chapter in the compendium of modern conspiracy theory, Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson would certainly have commented. But they preferred not to respond to questions about Bridle's fears.  The federal government's response to Bridle's warnings was also vacuous and evasive.  At Biontech: danger in blood transfusions from vaccinated people? mRNA nanoparticles in organs? These are questions that concern and move millions of people: spike proteins by vaccination, nanoparticles. Today, the federal government was asked about this and many other things.

Some of them work by strengthening the immune system by making the necessary components available, others by fighting the viruses themselves. The first group includes vitamins or amino acids, the second antiviral drugs such as ivermectin, budesonide, bromhexine and others. Ivermectin in particular has proved its effectiveness in India. Likewise in Africa, which is less well known.  Studies with 200 participants, which allegedly prove ineffectiveness, are gladly presented by the pharmaceutical industry and their friends. On the other hand, India and Africa have proven its effectiveness with 2.7 billion people.  For example, Indian states like Uttar Prahdesh, with a population of 236 million, used ivermectin for prophylaxis and early treatment for a while and had no problems, then it was suspended, cases went up, then it was reintroduced and cases immediately went down. In contrast, the small state of Tamil Nadu, with a population of 10 million, used remdesivir and had much worse results. Details can be found here and here. Overall, India had about 952 million people who gained immunity through infection as of early July, according to the nationwide antibody study, which translates to an infection mortality rate of 0.045%, well below that of influenza. A great success of the use of ivermectin in most of India.    But back to Africa. Twitter user KBirb put together an interesting thread showing the dramatic effectiveness of ivermectin:  In blue we see the countries using ivermectin and beige those without. Below that, the curves of deaths with (blue) and without (beige) ivermectin. Impressive. Deaths at the top, ""cases"" at the bottom, i.e., positive tests or otherwise detected as infection or covid disease.  So ivermectin drastically reduces ""cases"" and deaths.  Background for Ivermectin Use The group of countries with ivermectin use includes 31 countries with a total population of 972.5 million. Namely, the following countries:  Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo (Brazzaville), Congo (Kinshasa), Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea,Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda.  The group of countries not using ivermectin includes 22 countries with 357.3 million inhabitants: Algeria, Botswana, Cape Verde, Comoros, Egypt, Eritrea, Swaziland, Gambia, Lesotho, Libya, Madagascar, Mauritania, Mauritius, Morocco, Namibia, Sao Tome and Principe, Seychelles, Somalia, South Africa, Tunisia, Zambia, Zimbabwe.  In both groups there are countries with large populations as in the ivermectin group with Nigeria (206 million ew), Ethiopia (115 million ew) or Congo (84.1 million) and in the without with Egypt (100 million ew) or South Africa (59.3 million ew).  A Japanese study with Professor Hisya Tanioka dated March 26, 2021 clarifies the background. The study states, ""A retrospective statistical analysis of the effects of ivermectin against COVID-19 between the 31 onchocerciasis-endemic countries using the officially supported treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) and the 22 non-endemic countries in Africa.""  In the MSD Manual we find the following description of it: ""Onchocerciasis (river blindness) is an infection with the nematode Onchocerca volvulus. It causes itching, a rash, sometimes with scarring, and eye symptoms that can lead to blindness. This infection is spread by the bite of female black flies that breed in rivers.""  Related to this is the video that has gone viral featuring Haruo Ozaki, Chairman of the Tokyo Medical Association, recommending the off-label use of ivermectin to the Japanese Minister of Health based on the data from the Japanese study showing success in Africa.  Tokyo Medical Association Chairman Haruo Ozaki, August 13 2021 pic.twitter.com/ANgEbdm1Rn - Joe (@FonzyDizzle) August 23, 2021 KBirb produced two more interesting graphs on this based on the study and Ozaki's press appearance:  Cases per 100,000 population are 7.1-fold higher in countries without ivermectin than in those with.  Second, a comparison of deaths per 100,000 population between IVM and non-IVM groups shows a massive 13.3-fold difference. These data (cases and deaths) are consistent with the results of more recent data up to and including August 2021 from the Johns Hopkins Dashboards, which can be seen above.  The next logical question, of course, is the vaccination rate in African countries. Here's the answer: the difference is very similar to that for ""cases"" at 6.4-fold. With 1.94% the vaccination rate in the ivermectin group is very low, in the group without IVM with 12.4% it is clearly higher, but also still considerably below what is found in the industrialized countries.  Conclusion With prophylaxis and early treatment, SARS-CoV-2 can be rendered as harmless as the other endemic coronaviruses that have been rampant in our country for hundreds of years. Prophylaxis and early treatment are effective regardless of which variant the testing and sequencing industry has just found at enormous expense and waste of taxpayers' money and which the WHO has declared a Variant of Concern (VoC).  In Europe and the USA, it is mainly the early treatment of covid that is prevented. What remains is mostly intubation.

336,121544325885564782899645760766595032220,"❗️Immunologin: Why COVID-19 vaccinated will die months after mRNA vaccination The Prince Telegram QUOTE Now you will lose all humor:  [Netfund] Immunologist and molecular biologist Prof. Dolores Cahill: Why COVID-19 vaccinees will die months after mRNA vaccination.  Irish immunologist and molecular biologist Prof. Dr. Dolores Chahill [1] uses the study ""Immunization with SARS coronavirus vaccines leads to severe immune disease of the lungs after injection with wild SARS virus"" [2] to explain in the video why mRNA vaccines are associated with extreme risks. In many cases, when vaccinated individuals come into contact with wild coronavirus several months after vaccination, their immune systems will respond with a fatal cytokine storm. This because the vaccine mRNA genetically modifies the body's cells to produce the coronavirus spike protein. When a new coronavirus later activates the immune system, it recognizes the self-produced spike proteins as a threat and launches a major attack against the body's own cells. As a result, the vaccinated suffer septic shock with multiple organ failure, usually ending in death.  The French geneticist Alexandra Henrion-Caude, MD (former director of the National Institute of Health and Medical Research, Inserm) [3] demands:  The public must be educated about the life-threatening risks of mRNA vaccines for seniors before vaccination. It refers to the conclusions from the study ""Informed consent of COVID-19 vaccine trial participants on the risk of clinical disease exacerbation"" [4] and its clinical implications: The specific and significant risk of COVID-19 antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) should have been disclosed to subjects-both those currently in vaccine trials and those being recruited for the trials. Similarly, disclosure must be made to prospective patients once the vaccine is approved. This disclosure must be made prominently and independently to meet the standard of medical ethics for patient understanding and informed consent. mRNA vaccines do not protect against coronaviruses, they make them a deadly threat! Thus, it is necessary to clarify whether the term ""vaccine"" conceals a biological weapon system. In any case, the vaccine manufacturers, the WHO and their offshoots in the national authorities will try to blame the side effects (from a military point of view: main effects) of the mRNA vaccination on a mutated virus.  The pandemic makers will reinterpret those who died as a result of mRNA vaccination as COVID-21 dead. This is to be prevented by autopsies - because the vaccination victims are to serve them as justification for tough measures as well as for an extreme mass panic, which they know how to stir up via mass media. Their goal - to maximize the number of deaths through compulsory vaccination - becomes apparent in all its unscrupulousness.  At the same time, it is strategically important for the pandemic makers to eliminate the control group of the unvaccinated - and to do so as quickly as possible. Otherwise, it would quickly become apparent that only the vaccinated were dying. Therefore, all those who do not get injected with the highly risky mRNA vaccine are to be isolated and deported to quarantine camps as ""endangered persons"".  Now it becomes clear why Bill Gates announced with a sardonic grin in June 2020, ""The next virus will get attention"" [5] - and why Michael Ryan, as director of the WHO's ""emergency program,"" announced mass deportations to Corona quarantine camps on March 30, 2020, ""We need to get into homes and take members of your families.""

351,247035079020476422299088911905947250923,"By Dana Samson In a panel discussion titled COVID-19: A Second Opinion, renowned physicians and medical experts deliberated on the global Corona pandemic on Jan. 24 at Wisconsin State, moderated by Senator Ron Johnson. Among other things, they examined the current state of knowledge about early hospital treatments, the effectiveness of vaccinations, and they explored what went wrong or right in retrospect, what should be done now, and what should be planned for the future. The debate also included testimonials from individuals to get a broad picture of vaccination.  The video, which has now been viewed almost two million times, seems to be a very hot potato. It has so far been completely ignored by the major media. CNN offers a crude defamation of the senator trying to spread conspiracy theories in the form of a new ""Covid lie.""  Vaccine Damage Increasingly Known Through Databases The Corona vaccine is being increasingly criticized overall, and side effects are becoming more known through documentation of cases in databases. In Germany, hospital records provide evidence of an enormous increase in side effects.  The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database is also explained in the Wisconsin panel discussion. It shows a huge increase in reported adverse reactions and vaccine injuries. A similar trend can be seen in the World Health Organization (WHO) database:  The U.S. military also has a database of diseases and medical incidents among soldiers. The Defense Medical Epidemiology Database (DMED) documents, among other things, military hospital billings.  At least three whistleblowers disclosed figures from the database, attorney Thomas Renz reported at the hearing. Among the whistleblowers were Dr. Samuel Sigoloff, Peter Chambers and Theresa Long, who affirmed with an affidavit that a huge increase could be seen in almost all ICD codes for vaccine injuries, Renz announced. The ICD code is a globally recognized system used to name medical diagnoses uniformly.  If the data are correct, it would be proven once again that no other vaccine to date has recorded as many suspected adverse event reports as the vaccines that are effectively forced on people by their governments around the world.  This is also confirmed by data from the EudraVigilance database, the suspected vaccine adverse event database of the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  Rise in adverse events since Corona vaccination Further in the discussion, Renz states that a five-year average of data attributed to complaints or potential adverse events from vaccines was obtained from 2016 to 2020. The year 2021 can be placed next to the five-year average, Renz explains, to help identify changes in reported adverse events. From 2021, the data is only available until October, but it is still possible to see whether or not there has been an increase in the number of cases.  Miscarriages among female U.S. military personnel increased 300 percent in 2021 compared to the five-year average, Renz elaborates in an interview with the American news site 'TheBlaze.' The five-year average of billed codes of miscarriages per year was 1,499, he said, adding that 4,182 were reported in 2021 through November.  In 2016 through 2020, all ratios were similar, he said. Only in 2021, when the vaccination campaign began, did the numbers increase tremendously, Renz explained during the discussion.  In addition, the attorney reports a nearly 300 percent increase in cancer diagnoses. They had risen from a five-year average of 38,700 per year to 114,645 in the first months of 2021, he said. This finding was news to Senator Johnson as well, he noted.  Similarly, according to Renz, ICD codes for neurological problems increased by 1,000 percent, from a five-year average of 82,000 to 863,000. Journalist Daniel Horowitz's 'TheBlaze' interview with Renz, the whistleblower's attorney, cited other rates of increase in the diseases:  Myocardial infarction: 269 percent increase Paralysis: Increase of 291 percent Congenital malformations (in children of military personnel): Increase of 156 percent Female infertility: Increase of 471 percent Pulmonary embolisms: increase of 467 percent The data is based on outpatient diagnosis data, according to 'TheBlaze'. Still, Renz explains that the numbers would indicate an increase in hospitalized patients. In addition, he cautions, the numbers do not represent individual patients, but rather indicate the totality of ICD diagnosis codes at one point in time. A patient who has had a stroke, for example, will have multiple neurological ICD codes over the period of his or her treatment and numerous outpatient and inpatient hospital visits. Nevertheless, the data show a huge increase in treatments since the vaccination campaign began.  Physician: Diseases Are Due to COVID-19 Vaccination According to Renz, a military physician provided an affidavit stating, ""It is my professional opinion that the majority of the increase in incidences of the miscarriages, cancers, and diseases discussed above are due to COVID-19 vaccination.""  In the interview with Horowitz, one of the whistleblowers states that he was alarmed by the sudden metastatic cancers, autoimmune diseases, and heart and circulatory disorders that have caused many soldiers to have to discontinue some training programs. Evidence of increased cancer growth from the Covid vaccine was also recently expressed at the 2nd Pathology Conference in Germany. The whistleblower goes on to say in the interview that physicians in the military had been motivated to investigate DMED data because of the empirically rising numbers. However, he says, some physicians were intimidated by orders and did not perform all of the examinations.  Renz reiterated in his presentation to the senator that the military data are particularly frightening because this group is healthy, athletic, young people. The many cases of heart problems among professional athletes worldwide point in the same direction.  The military is in the service of the public, so such data must be made transparent for general safety, Renz added. It is especially important that soldiers are in the best of health, he said. Otherwise, it could be dangerous in the case of neurological failures in pilots, for example. It's not just a matter of public health, but rather national security, Renz stressed.  Given the military's premise that both public health and especially national security should be preserved, wouldn't the findings on U.S. soldiers need to be examined more closely? Shouldn't the data from the DMED database be causing a stir? Especially as more and more children and adolescents are being vaccinated?  Meanwhile, the U.S. military has announced it will begin discharging thousands of soldiers who still refuse vaccination.

354,243592825920946149546492724489000609155,"It was the fear of mutants of the SARS-CoV2 virus that led the prime ministers in mid-January to tighten the mask requirement once again. Since then, we have to wear FFP2 or surgical masks in stores and public transport. And it is precisely these masks that are not suitable for this application, because ""what we put over our mouths and noses is actually hazardous waste,"" says Prof. Michael Braungart, the scientific director of the Hamburg Environmental Institute.  Even though the fleece of most FFP2 masks appears to be paper, it is actually a thermoplastic: polypropylene. In addition, there are adhesives, binders, antioxidants, UV stabilizers in large quantities. In addition, the researchers from the Hamburg Environmental Institute and Leuphana University in Lüneburg, where Michael Braungart is a professor of eco-design, found volatile organic hydrocarbons in the certified masks. In some there were also large amounts of formaldehyde or aniline, and then additionally artificial fragrances, which are supposed to mask the unpleasant chemical smell. In the case of the blue-colored surgical masks, cobalt is also usually used as a dye. All in all, we are wearing a chemical cocktail in front of our nose and mouth, which has never been tested for its toxicity and never for any long-term effects. And because the chemicals alone don't seem to be enough, we also inhale microfiber particles that are just the right size to lodge in our lungs or travel on through our bodies from there.  Every bit of dirt in the world The politicians who prescribe us this chemical cocktail with microplastics as masks are starting from completely false premises, says Michael Braungart. So are the people who wear the masks: ""We think that since this is surgical equipment, it should be healthy. But since most people in China, where most of the masks are produced, have never thought about the environment, they just use whatever works. There's every filth in the world in there.""  The basic problem: The ingredients of the masks are not affected by the approval. Only the functionality is tested. If the mask shows adequate filtration efficiency, it gets certified. And then ah mainly the elderly also get a letter from the federal government with two vouchers with which they can pick up six masks each at the pharmacy for an additional payment of two euros. Of all people, it is the pharmacists who make sure that people get their toxic cocktail.  The microplastic fibers that come off the mask fleece are particularly problematic. The teams around Michael Braungart had the masks examined and found exactly those fibers that are the most dangerous according to the definition of the German Social Accident Insurance (DGUV). The DGUV's ""Staub-Info"" states: ""Fiber dusts are airborne particles of inorganic or organic substances that have an elongated geometry. Fibers that have a length of > 5 µm, a diameter < 3 µm, and exceed a length-to-diameter ratio of 3:1 play a special role, since only they can penetrate the deeper respiratory tract. Fibers of this geometry are also referred to as WHO fibers."" The Accident Insurance net site has long instructions from the employers' liability insurance associations on occupational safety when handling such fibers and links to the Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which lists the various TRGS, the technical rules for handling hazardous substances. And it is precisely these hazardous substances that are being prescribed to our faces. Lung damage is possible without a virus.  Remedy?  What to do? Michael Braungart, a chemist and process engineer, recommends putting FFP2 and surgical masks in the oven for half an hour and heating them to fifty degrees before use. The plastic cannot withstand more, but this temperature is sufficient for a large part of the cocktail of pollutants it contains to evaporate. Then at least you don't wear that right in front of your nose anymore.  Besides, we should not wear the masks for a long time. Tests have shown that the abrasion of the microplastic fibers from the mask fleece increases significantly over time. Mechanical stress during donning and doffing also leads to increased fiber abrasion. Medical professionals or nurses who wear the masks only when they go into the operating room or intensive care unit, and dispose of the masks when they come out, are exposed to far fewer microfibers than people who have to wear the masks for long trips or at work for many hours. In any case, the masks are not suitable for multiple uses. The federal government doesn't seem to realize this, as it only provides retirees with six discounted masks for two full months.  Of course, we could still put one of the community masks, which are no longer allowed in stores or on public transportation, under the prescribed chemical cocktails, hoping that it will act as a filter against microplastics. But then you have two masks on your nose, and that doesn't make breathing any easier, as you may suspect and the self-experiment shows. But with a particularly thin fabric mask, it might work.  Remedy.  ""The only know-how advantage we Europeans have is environmental and health,"" says Michael Braungart: ""And we should use it!"" So in May, together with female students at Leuphana University, the professor founded a non-profit limited liability company that aims to turn the knowledge about material cycles and materials accumulated in degree courses and worked up in specialized theses into practical applications. The start-up is called ""Holy Shit."" and is initially a consulting company for companies that want to convert their products to the ""Cradle to Cradle"" standard. The cradle-to-cradle principle organizes material flows in such a way that no waste is produced, and therefore no pollutants.  Founded in the midst of the pandemic, the start-up Holy Shit has now also developed a pollutant-free face mask that is completely biodegradable as its first own product. In collaboration with the Swiss company Climatex AG, this Viva Mask is now being produced and distributed by the Bavarian company Viotrade GmbH. It is made - no, not from cotton, but from FSC-certified cellulose. Because unlike cotton, cellulose is not a breeding ground for bacteria, even when worn for long periods of time. The young developers spent a long time looking for a suitable material and then gave the mask a double-layered shape, into which a fleece can now be inserted that meets the FFP2 standard. This is not yet available in a biodegradable form, but it can be removed before washing the mask and reinserted for wearing. Speaking of washing, the mask is supposed to last fifty times. After that, you can put it in the compost, or directly into the flower pot, say the developers.  The manufacturers are currently working on getting the mask combination of cellulose and FFP2 fleece certified. Once that's done, there will be an alternative to the toxic cocktails of microplastic masks that can withstand police scrutiny. In the meantime, it would be a nice task for the Federal Ministry of Health to check the masks prescribed by the federal and state governments for their harmfulness to health. Perhaps Jens Spahn and Lothar Wieler would also like to know what they have in their faces. And with which long-term damages by the mask regulation our health service may argue then in a few years.

Coronalage report: 7,800 Euro bounty for miraculous corona increase Coronalage report: 7,800 Euro bounty for miraculous corona increase German hospitals are paid a bounty of 7,800 Euro and more for every regular patient that can be statistically converted into an inpatient corona case by a positive test.  By Gunter Frank, MD Yesterday evening, the head physician of a large clinic informed me of the following: There is, valid since November 1, for each positive Corona-tested and to the health department reported patient in the hospital in addition to the normal billing 7,800 euros, if he stays at least 2 nights in the hospital, increaseable with longer stay to almost 10,000 euros. Covid symptoms the patient does not have to have at all, it is enough a test. A completely grotesque incentive with consequences. Sprained ankle, positive test: ""You'd better stay here for two days for observation."" This is how hospitals are filled with alleged corona patients, without any work at all, because these patients are basically fit, and they earn a golden hospital nose in the process. The rate of occupancy statistics will increase as a result of this grossly manipulated data, at a time when we are making hospital occupancy the main decision criterion for pandemic policy. The money in this comes directly from the federal government.  Once again, the current ""RKI Weekly Situation Report on Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19),"" as of Dec. 2, 2021, also raises some questions. In the following, I would like to address the main points. Before doing so, two remarks:  First, the RKI still refers to positive Corona test results as cases, even though they are viral debris detections without evidence of infection. In addition, the ""cases"" are presented in absolute numbers and not in relation to the total number of tests, which hardly allows any conclusions to be drawn about the actual infection situation in the population as a whole. Both are grossly misleading, in my opinion.  Secondly, according to the correct opinion of RKI staff, the Corona star occurrence corresponds to a mild flu wave in the spring of 2020 and a severe flu wave in the winter of 20/21. In this article of the Ärzteblatt (submitted revised version 2/3/2021) one can read, although hidden on page 5, but clearly: ""Compared to previous years, excess mortality in the spring was about the same as in the 2019 influenza wave and in the fall was similar to the 2017/2018 influenza waves.""  Now for the weekly report in the briefest terms possible, COVID mortality and COVID intensive care occupancy do not go together. Who is in the ICU as a COVID patient?  Figure 2 shows that the number of COVID ""cases"" is at winter 20/21 levels.  Figures 8 and 9 show that hospitalized cases continue to affect primarily those aged 60 to 79 and those aged 80 and over.  Figure 12 shows the total number of SARI (severe respiratory infection) patients requiring intensive care. It is at the spring 2020 level (blue bars). Of these, however, the proportion of COVID-19 cases has increased significantly, currently to 80 percent (red line). (Minor criticism of the plot: the red curve exceeds the blue bars, even though they account for only 80 percent of it.)  Figure 13 shows the COVID intensive care cases reported according to the DIVI intensive care registry. In spring max. 2,905, in winter 20/21 max. 5,762, and currently 4,690 patients. Currently, according to the DIVI, about half of them are receiving invasive ventilation.  And now the crucial Figure 15, which shows that the death rate is at a much lower level than in winter 20/21. Unfortunately, spring 2020 is missing. Because the current COVID mortality is even below that. That is, below what RKI staff have called a mild flu wave (2019).  If there are very many COVID ""cases"" and at the same time so few deaths, one could take that as evidence of vaccination success. However, one could also say that the weakest have already died in the winter of 20/21. A severe flu wave is usually followed by a milder one. One could also argue that seasonal respiratory viruses lose their pathogenicity through mutation and cross-immunities and slowly become endemic.  But then why are there so many elderly COVID patients in ICU, almost as many as in winter 20/21? And even half of them are currently on invasive ventilation. That should cause a much higher mortality rate, but there is not. This raises the question for me: who is in ICU as a COVID patient and is not included in the German COVID mortality statistics? I have a hunch, but it is not yet confirmed enough to say.  Completely misleading presentation of impending ICU overloads At first glance, Figure 14 suggests a frightening overload of ICUs caused by COVID-19 patients. But this is grossly incorrect. As is well known, ICU occupancy has been at an almost constant level of 20,000 patients since spring 2020. The maximum proportion of COVID cases in this context was about 30 percent in winter 20/21. The annual average for all hospitals was just under 4 percent Report on Coronalage Sept. 20, 2021: two-percent. The scandal number.  The fact that the occupancy of intensive care units is always kept at as high a level as possible can also be understood from a billing perspective. When there is little going on, cases are also transferred there for which it is not really necessary. If many serious cases are admitted, they can be transferred back to the normal ward. Business as usual. However, during the course of the Corona crisis, the available beds have nevertheless decreased, as is well known, by more than 5,000. The DIVI winds up claiming that this reduction in beds is the result of restructuring due to costly quarantine requirements. But the biggest drop in available ICU beds is related in time to changes in billing arrangements. Since, as of November 2020, only ICUs that reported 75 percent occupancy received high COVID allowances, vacant beds were simply not reported when it was necessary to show the 75 percent. This is a very logical conclusion. Even the Federal Accounting Office politely refers to this as ""undesirable deadweight loss."" Intensive care bed research: the Schrappe case - WELT (WELT plus, 6/29/2021) In addition, the shortage of nurses, which has been criminally neglected for years, is making itself painfully felt, as many intensive care beds cannot now be operated for this reason. Testing chaos continues to drive this trend. In this situation, announcing an unholy vaccination requirement, especially for nursing staff, can only be described as insane. I have spoken to enough nurses to report significant side effects - even deaths - of staff after vaccination that have not been officially followed up on. Many of the previously unvaccinated nurses are afraid of this vaccination and will then quit the service (something similar has already happened in France).  Figure 14 shows this reduction in vacant beds, but suggests that this is a consequence of the extremely steep red curve of COVID cases. This can apparently panic prime ministers, but not anyone who can put one and one together. It is not COVID-19 that is leading to localized and temporary overloads of ICUs (though these can always be absorbed by transfer). Rather, a worsening nurse shortage in an aging society is increasingly pushing nursing units beyond their breaking point. This means nothing other than a profound failure of health policy and hospital management, for which the whole of society is now being held liable through deprivation of liberty and unfortunate compulsory vaccination. And the Federal Constitutional Court thinks this is right (who doubts that it will also give its nod to compulsory vaccination?) Pandemic of the unvaccinated? Rather a pandemic of ignorance - or of lies?  On page 21 of the RKI weekly report it says: ""For the calculation of the respective incidences, the fully vaccinated and unvaccinated cases were put in relation to the fully vaccinated and the unvaccinated population. For the period shown in Figure 17, sufficient information on vaccination status was available for 706,863 of the 836,135 (85%) symptomatic COVID-19 cases reported or for 41,745 of the 60,387 (69%) hospitalized COVID-19 cases reported.""  In other words, for hospitalized patients, vaccination status is unclear for one-third.  Table 3 on page 23 provides information on the so-called vaccination breakthroughs. That is, illness despite, because of, who knows, vaccination. However, without reference to the overall vaccination rate of the respective age groups (Figure 16).  One sees the proportion of ""vaccination breakthroughs"" overall among 18- to 59-year-olds at 50 percent (vaccination rate about 7 percent) and among 60+-year-olds at 71.3 percent (vaccination rate 85 percent). In terms of hospitalized patients alone, the proportion for ""vaccination breakthroughs"" is correspondingly 29 and 54.5 percent. For intensive care patients, it is 15.7 and 44.5 percent, respectively. For deceased patients, 18.2 and 48 percent, respectively.  Adding in vaccination rates, there are more COVID unvaccinated people in the hospital according to these calculations, although the differences are much smaller than the brute rhetoric of the ""pandemic of the unvaccinated"" would have you believe. Quite apart from the fact that vaccination promised something quite different....  But how does the determination of vaccination status actually work. Are there standards? And how do the authorities deal with it? Markus Söder, for example, commented via Twitter on Nov. 18, ""Unfortunately, Corona infections are increasing dramatically, especially among the unvaccinated. There is a direct correlation of low vaccination rates and high infection rates. Therefore, please get vaccinated. Only vaccination helps."" According to a graph he posted, the seven-day incidence was 1,469 among the unvaccinated and only 110 among the vaccinated, but the Bavarian State Office of Public Health, which is responsible, does not even know the vaccination status of the vast majority of cases. In the week before 24.11., for example, 81,782 ""cases"" were reported there. Fully vaccinated 9,641, unvaccinated 14,652. Unknown 57,489. That is about 70 percent. The authority simply counted this number of unknowns among the unvaccinated, and it was to this ratio that the Bavarian prime minister referred. What should we call that? Deception? Incompetence? Lie? They continue to do so to this day. The same practices can be found in the Hamburg Senate. I could not see how the RKI proceeded in its weekly report regarding those without known vaccination status.  All these scandalous procedures are exposed in a report in the WELT ""Pandemic of Ignorance"", published on 3.12. As far as I know, there are no standards whatsoever with which the vaccination status is recorded. There is no binding documentation. Especially not in combination with patients suffering from diseases that are in the broad side effect spectrum of the novel COVID vaccines. In other words, in the case of a vaccination that is still only approved on a conditional basis.  Let's face it: Hospitals have received 15 billion euros as COVID compensation payments. 600 million for the development of intensive care capacities. The result is intensive care bed reductions and a representation of intensive care medicine that has still not managed to communicate the age, sex and vaccination status of intensive care patients as part of the DIVI daily reports. They just can't get it right. Perhaps DIVI officials are too busy spreading panic on the talk shows. In the meantime, the DIVI even had to be ordered to do so by politicians, as Die Welt writes: ""On November 13, the so-called ""DIVI Intensive Care Registry Ordinance"" was updated. In it, the DIVI association is requested to report in the future, in addition to the number of patients, among other things, the age cohorts as well as the vaccination status, and to do so on a daily basis. ... But: Nothing happened. On request, the DIVI explained that it would still take ""a few weeks"". And the RKI, which is responsible for the technical implementation, stated: ""We are not aware of a specific deadline for implementing the new requirements (...)."" The process of implementation needs ""some time"". It is not possible to give an exact date.""

Nevertheless, word has spread about the positive experience doctors have had with preparations such as ivermectin: In the U.S., there have already been several lawsuits against hospitals to force patients to be treated with the drug. Remarkably, judges have ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. by Vanessa Renner A case in Ohio is currently causing a stir: There, a 51-year-old patient is now being ventilated by machine, his condition is steadily deteriorating and his chances of survival are dwindling. The treating West Chester Hospital, however, stubbornly stuck to its protocol for Covid 19 disease.  The patient's wife, Julie Smith, contacted a physician with the Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLOCCC), which is working extensively to develop and test effective treatments for Covid. Dr. Fred Wagshul recommended the use of ivermectin in this case and prescribed the drug to the patient. Although Smith willingly released the hospital from any liability and wanted to be responsible for using the drug herself to increase her husband's chances of survival, West Chester Hospital refused.  Patient now additionally struggles with aspiration pneumonia From a professional perspective, it is particularly concerning that the patient's condition had continued to deteriorate even through hospital treatment. They stubbornly stuck with the treatment protocol for Covid-19, according to court documents, and followed through until they felt they could only keep the patient alive by sedating, intubating and ventilating him. Admitted on July 15, Jeffrey Smith was intubated on Aug. 1 after unsuccessful treatment with remdesivir, steroids and plasma. Then, on Aug. 3, 2021, it happened that the 51-year-old woke up due to inadequate anesthesia - mind you, with two tubes in his throat; one for air supply, one for tube feeding. It's common for waking patients to instinctively try to dispose of these foreign objects. Smith was no exception: He tore out the air tube, damaging the tube that was supplying him with food, and thus aspirated parts of the tube feed. This got into his lungs and caused inflammation (aspiration pneumonia). Even without the presence of Covid 19 disease, this is extremely critical, especially for weakened patients.  In fact, according to the protocol, Smith then suffered infection after infection and became increasingly sicker and weaker. The fact that clinics often rely on ventilation too early in the case of Covid-19, thus activating a vicious circle, has been repeatedly criticized by physicians worldwide: Renowned physicians such as Dr. Peter McCullough have always called for early treatment with effective drugs such as ivermectin: this would successfully prevent severe courses for the most part.  While vaccine side effects are accepted by policymakers, here they suddenly invoke possible adverse reactions of patients to the drugs - even though reports of critical side effects are usually based on completely wrong dosages and incorrect use (for example, because people in their desperation for horses took dosed preparations on their own). In truth, ivermectin has long been proven and approved by the FDA - just not specifically for the treatment of covid-19. So-called ""off label use"" of the drug, however, is quite common.  Julie Smith is not the first to obtain treatment through a lawsuit. Relatives have already succeeded in obtaining a court ruling for the use of ivermectin in seriously ill family members. And so it was in the case of Jeffrey Smith: the judge from Butler County in Ohio showed insight and ordered the immediate administration of ivermectin in accordance with Dr. Wagshul's prescription.  It now remains to be hoped that the delayed medication can help him despite aspiration pneumonia.",Lawsuits against hospitals: U.S. judges order Covid treatment with ivermectin,Other
382,270338605493220359831391400410880445727,"The UK government has published a shocking report on the side effects of Pfizer and AstraZeneca's Corona vaccines. About 5.4 million first doses of Pfizer's vaccine and 1.5 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine were administered in the UK. Also, 0.5 million second doses, mainly from Pfizer, were administered.  The Pfizer shot resulted in 49,472 adverse events since Dec. 8. AstraZeneca's vaccine led to 21,032 adverse reactions. This means that 1 in 333 people suffered an adverse reaction. The actual number may be even higher because not all adverse reactions are reported.  The Daily Expose took a closer look at the report - which you can read here - and listed the key findings. Thanks to Pfizer's vaccine, five people have gone blind and another 31 are visually impaired. A total of 634 eye cases have been reported so far.  Imagine being locked in your house for a year without being able to see your family or friends. You believe that thanks to an experimental ""vaccine,"" you can get your life back and see your family and friends again. You take the vaccine and then you can't see anything at all.  How is this possible?  Thanks to Pfizer's experimental vaccine, 21 cerebrovascular accidents, popularly known as strokes, have also been reported. In such a case, there is a sudden interruption of blood flow to the brain, which leads to the death of brain cells. As a result, the brain no longer functions properly.  The British government admitted late last year that it does not know whether Pfizer's vaccine affects fertility. Pfizer advises against giving the vaccine during pregnancy and to wait at least two months after the second dose to become pregnant.  So how in the world is it possible that Pfizer's vaccine caused four women to spontaneously miscarry? Why are pregnant women getting this vaccine? You won't hear about it in the media. Two women miscarried after receiving the AstraZeneca shot.  Sudden Death As if that weren't enough, the report also lists 59 reports of deaths and seven reports of sudden deaths. That's seven people who dropped dead immediately after receiving the vaccine. In all, 107 ""fatal events"" have been reported in the U.K. as a result of Pfizer's vaccine.  For example, five people have gone blind, 21 have suffered strokes, four have miscarried - although the government advises that pregnant women are better off not being injected - and 107 have died. There have also been 69 reports of Bell's facial paralysis. All thanks to an experimental vaccine approved for emergency use only. What's more, you can't hold the manufacturers liable for any damages.  According to the government, there is no need to worry. Most of those vaccinated are elderly and have underlying diseases, which increases the likelihood of side effects, the British government said.  Tens of thousands of people with underlying diseases died after testing positive for Corona. They were all counted as having died from Corona. Now people with underlying diseases are also dying after vaccination, but the British government says it has to do with the underlying disease.

384,40503540851545846926499460501397944101,"Massive increase of diseases as a result of the vaccination campaign in the US military The massive side effects and long-term consequences of the vaccination campaigns with the genetically engineered drugs, denied by politics and the pharmaceutical industry, are becoming more and more obvious. With the VAERS reporting systems and the EMA's EudraVigilance database, many of these go unrecorded. In the U.S. military, however, all are 100% documented and the results are startling.  By Dr. Peter F. Mayer Reporting on the results of a hearing held by Senator Ron Johnson, Daniel Horowitz wrote on Twitter, ""I can tell you from Attorney Thomas Renz that the number of cancer diagnoses in the military's DMED system has increased from a 5-year average (2016-2020) of 38,700 per year to 114,645 in the first 11 months of 2021. This is predominantly young population. Unlike VAERS, where naysayers can suggest anyone can enroll, this is only from military physicians and quantifies every single ICD code in the military for Humana's tri-care billing. This is the ultimate defined and finite population with excellent surveillance.""  And further, ""The video of Renz is here https://t.co/L61yEGayfV I know 2 of the 3 cited whistleblowers. Their credentials are impeccable. Lt. Col. Chambers is one of the only Green Beret doctors in the military. - Daniel Horowitz (@RMConservative) January 25, 2022 Renz is a US attorney and has uncovered some big stuff. He reports in the video that miscarriages are observed to be up 300 percent over previous years, as is cancer, Neurological problems that can affect pilots are recording an increase of over 1000%.  Biochemical causes of the massively appearing illnesses by the mRNA preparations With the long-term consequences it goes more and more frequently in the direction of increased infection susceptibility, which was or is produced by a disturbance of the immune system, thus by the vaccination. Many forms of cancer, but also many so-called autoimmune diseases are caused by (partly so-called atypical) mycobacteria. As long as they are kept in check by the immune system, this is not a problem. If the immune system is impaired, a whole series of diseases occur more frequently.  The biochemical background for these now increased miscarriages, cancers or neurological problems is discussed in an article published in Researchgate by Stephanie Seneff, Greg Nigh, Anthony Kyriakopoulos and Peter McCullough entitled ""Innate Immune Suppression by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccinations: The role of G-quadruplexes, exosomes and microRNAs."" The role of G-quadruplexes, exosomes and microRNAs) highlights.  It states, ""The mRNA vaccines use genetically modified mRNA that encodes spike proteins. These modifications hide the mRNA from cellular defenses, promote a longer biological half-life of the proteins, and result in higher overall spike protein production. However, experimental studies and observations show that the immune response to the vaccines is quite different from the response to infection with SARS-CoV-2. As we will show, the genetic changes introduced by the vaccine are likely the cause of these different responses. In this paper, we present evidence that vaccination, unlike natural infection, causes profound impairment of type I interferon signaling, which has several adverse consequences for human health. We explain the mechanism by which immune cells release large amounts of exosomes into the bloodstream that contain spike proteins along with critical microRNAs that trigger a signaling response in recipient cells at distant sites. We also identify potentially profound perturbations in the regulatory control of protein synthesis and cancer surveillance. These perturbations may be directly related to neurodegenerative diseases, myocarditis, immune thrombocytopenia, Bell's palsy, liver disease, impaired adaptive immunity, increased tumorigenesis, and DNA damage. We show evidence from adverse event reports in the VAERS database that supports our hypothesis. We believe that a comprehensive risk-benefit assessment of mRNA vaccines precludes them from making a positive contribution to public health, even in the context of the Covid 19 pandemic.""  In light of these observations, it is again apparent that 2G, lockdown for the unvaccinated, and mandatory vaccination constitute the offense of intentional or at least negligent assault. So does the attempt by the president of the medical association to prohibit physicians from providing information about the side effects and possible long-term consequences. The harm apparently far outweighs the already questionable benefit.

387,303083714647861725714958022836405175317,"We already had a ""pandemic"" once: the swine flu in 2009. And such a kind of liability exemption already existed for the swine flu vaccination. At the time, I had also written a few articles on this point:    Almost Forgotten: The swine flu vaccination in 2009 - Chancellor and ministers received vaccines WITHOUT ""effect enhancers"" Narcolepsy by swine flu vaccine Pandemrix: So look allegedly ""safe"" vaccines... Sweden: Severe side effects and deaths by swine flu vaccination?And with the planned ""Corona vaccination"" this liability exemption is to be granted likewise?According to Dr. Mercola this seems to be the generally common practice for the USA anyway. In a 2016 article, he talks about a ""ban on vaccine-related lawsuits"" and a liability exemption for old and new vaccines. Again, the government must pay for any vaccine injuries. And that was up to this point an amount of 3.5 billion USD for more than 3500 victims of vaccine damage.Vaccine Liability ProtectionWhat does the business community say about liability exemption?On August 4, 2020, this interesting article[1] appeared in ""Cashkurs"" with the headline ""Covid-19: Vaccine manufacturers are granted liability exemption"".The first sentence already characterizes the situation. Namely, here we learn that an essential part of the preparations for a new Covid-19 vaccination is the preparation of the big pharmaceutical companies to arm themselves now against class action lawsuits due to vaccine damage. That is, the manufacturers themselves assume that their vaccination will bring some damage here that could have been avoided without the vaccination.The second part of the opening sentence of the article characterizes the role of the WHO in this context. For it is the WHO that is said to have made the proposal to set up nationally established special funds. And the justification for this is breathtaking: ""... in order to pass on the costs of possible compensation payments to the taxpayer"".Or in other words: Considering that we already had a barely tested vaccine in the swine flu ""pandemic"" that caused quite a few cases of narcolepsy in children and adolescents, it should be surprising that the same scenario is now rolling towards us again. Only this time, it's a notch worse.By the way, if this kind of information interests you, be sure to request my free practice newsletter, ""Independent. Naturally. Klare Kante."" about it:While the swine flu vaccine was still a traditional vaccine, in which deactivated viruses or virus particles were vaccinated, a number of the new Covid-19 vaccines are so-called RNA vaccines. And in these vaccines, there are no viruses or virus particles or their antigens. Rather, the genetic information of SARS-CoV-2 is injected into the recipient here, and the recipient's organism is turned into a bioreactor designed to produce the desired antigens. The failure of the bioreactor in the production process is an immense saving for the pharmaceutical industry in terms of time, effort and cost. For the vaccinated person, it is a gamble with his own health or even his own life, because no one knows in which body cells this RNA will perform its service, and no one knows how the organism will react to such modified cells. In the worst case, the RNA will enter the brain cells and start working there. An adequate immune response would be the destruction of these cells by T-cells, killer cells, etc., but this would simultaneously lead to the destruction of brain tissue. If something like this were to take place in the language center, for example, then everything that has to do with language and understanding would possibly be exposed to the risk of total loss.If such processes were to take place in the brain stem, then this would no longer be compatible with life.The new Eldorado for the pharmaceutical industryThese considerations are now being voiced more and more frequently and ever more loudly in public. And with it, skepticism among the population seems to be gaining momentum. This is also the conclusion of the ""Cashkurs"" article: ""Not only in the USA and on the African continent, but also in many parts of the rest of the world, confidence in a vaccine against the new coronavirus, which has been rushed through by politics, research and pharmaceutical companies, seems to be rather low. ""The article then goes on to say that AstraZeneca[2] had confirmed that there is no legal recourse against their new vaccination, also an RNA vaccination, in the event of side effects and death. Such news is hardly likely to inspire confidence in the new product. Rather, the opposite is the case.But, the lack of trust and the accompanying lack of acceptance would logically translate into hardly any significant executions of vaccinations. Not a desirable goal for politics and industry. A ""legal vaccination obligation"" would then be a favorable option to counteract this development and to ensure business despite widespread skepticism.And a legally imposed vaccination obligation (vaccination obligation) against Covid-19 without the possibility to hold the causers responsible in case of side effects and deaths is a disaster for the so considered population! For the manufacturers it is a new Eldorado to realize their business without consideration of losses under even more favorable conditions!This condition was realized with a kind of blackmail tactics, to which a high-ranking member of the board of directors of AstraZeneca confessed when he stated that without this legal immunity the company would not have wanted to develop a vaccine. And he goes on to admit that he and his company have already factored in side effects: ""This is a unique situation where we as a company simply cannot take that kind of risk - especially if a vaccine is going to have side effects for years. ""Is it possible to know if the new vaccine will have side effects for years? This is completely impossible. For this, one would have to have observed this new vaccination for years in order to be able to make reliable statements. But the new vaccine is to be thrown among the people in record time.Why does the WHO want special funds?I believe that this question can be answered quickly and easily: Even the WHO knows that such a vaccine, developed in a flash and then deployed, entails an enormous risk. Of course, they don't want to put a spoke in the wheel of Gates, Pharma and Co. and categorically reject such a vaccination. So the idea of special funds is just right. One does something for the victims, which one expects obviously, does not disturb the business of the Pharmaindustrie and brought itself again as alleged benefactor into the play. WHO - I am afraid of you.The obviousness with which vaccination victims are expected and accepted is contempt for humanity of a special kind. The ""Cashkurs"" article puts it this way: ""Because it is almost foreseeable that in the case of such a large-scale vaccination program a number of vaccinated people could suffer health damage or perhaps even death, some nations have already set up special funds to provide financial compensation to those potentially affected or their remaining relatives. The WHO supports this model of compensation potentially to be paid by all taxpayers. ""ConclusionThe perversion seems to be perfect. Precisely because politicians and industry seem to assume a considerable number of victims due to the new vaccination, special funds and exclusion of liability for the manufacturers of the vaccinations are decided. It is to be feared that the number of victims by the vaccination will be disproportionately larger than by Covid-19. In order to have here even a rudimentary argument for the vaccination, Covid-19 mortality figures are manipulated in the meantime by tricky counting methods highly.Because what is this for a vaccination, which causes more deaths than the pathogen, against which is to be inoculated?Sources:    [1] Covid-19: Vaccine makers to be exempt from liability claims - Cashkurs.com | Independent Business, Finance & Politics News [2] AstraZeneca to be exempt from coronavirus vaccine liability claims in most countries - Reuters Contributed image: 123rf.com - Olga Yastremska",Corona vaccine manufacturers not liable for side effects?,Other

Even the Greens are currently only cautiously fighting for their former ideals - and are wrestling with the ÖVP over a coalition line.Werner Kogler did not look particularly amused when he stood in front of journalists on Tuesday last week. After all, it's never fun when you have to capitulate in front of an audience. ""I can express my opinion without having a prong break out of my crown if there is no consensus,"" the vice chancellor finally explained.Before Kogler, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and Interior Minister Karl Nehammer had made it clear at the same meeting that there would be no unity anytime soon. The coalition partners are far apart on the question of how Austria should react to the situation on the Greek border. The Greens would like to get women and children out of the overcrowded camps on the islands, while the ÖVP thinks this is a well-intentioned but not very clever idea. ""If we now give in to Turkish pressure, then hundreds of thousands will follow, and the Europe without internal borders will be history,"" said Sebastian Kurz.At the longer leverGreen ministers and mandataries sometimes seemed in the last few days like teenagers who have to grumble to note that their embarrassing parents unfortunately sit at the longer lever. In the government, the ÖVP is clearly in charge of the budget. The only thing the Greens can do is to keep pointing out that they would like to be a bit more generous themselves, but unfortunately they can't get their way. Migration and asylum were the only issues in the government negotiations that could not be finalized harmoniously even after several attempts. For this reason, a crisis mechanism was agreed upon, just in case: Should it not be possible to agree on joint measures in an exceptional situation, both partners have the right to seek other majorities in parliament. It is uncertain whether a government can withstand something like this; no one in Austria has tried it yet. Is a test run imminent? ""You are poor sausages ""The comments on the Twitter and Facebook accounts of Green mandataries certainly give cause for concern. When Werner Kogler recently informed his fans and followers on social media that Austria would provide three million euros for emergency aid in Syria, he triggered a shitstorm. ""Sorry, dear Greens, that you are not ashamed of yourselves,"" wrote one user: ""Yesterday I still thought Werner Kogler had guts and was making a difference.

That, too, has happened, Bürstmayr admits: ""But there were only a few."" The expectations that many Green voters and sympathizers have of the party are very high, especially when it comes to migration. MP Michel Reimon is much harsher: ""These demands for moral purity really get on my nerves. I have no sympathy for people who tell us to drop everything immediately. ""Representatives of the pure doctrineWhen they were still in opposition, the Greens were considered representatives of the pure doctrine on asylum issues. In October 2015 - when the red-black coalition was in power and the chancellor was Werner Faymann - the announcement of construction measures at the Spielfeld border crossing in Styria caused outrage. Eva Glawischnig, head of the Green Party at the time, described the planned fences as ""a sign of desolidarization and the Orbanization of the ÖVP."" The infamous ""Türl mit Seitenteilen"" was hardly needed because soon after its completion the influx of refugees subsided. But the equipment wasn't thrown away, just stowed away. ""We could ramp up the entire system at any time within three or four hours,"" the ""Kronen Zeitung"" recently quoted Styrian Deputy Military Commander Ernst Trinkl as saying, adding that everything was still there, the computers, fingerprint scanners, toilets, fences, tents. The equipment is currently being checked ""for usability,"" according to the colonel. The Greens don't make a peep about such stories. And that is not just coalition reason, but simply political reason. The consensus in the country is that events like those in the fall of 2015 must not be repeated under any circumstances. Even Caritas would probably agree with that. There is broad agreement that borders can be protected. Sebastian Kurz has not only been right with his hard line on many issues - he also has two election victories to his credit. Everyone has understood this lesson.Certain disillusionmentAustria has taken in a very large number of asylum seekers over the past five years, and the influx continues to be greater than in most other EU countries. The majority of the population has had enough for the time being, and there is no great willingness to help (see survey). Green Party member Bürstmayr understands this: ""Of course, it's difficult when large refugee movements occur too quickly one after the other,"" he says. In addition, there is also a certain disillusionment, because the reality turned out to be less perfect than many had hoped in the times of the welcome culture. In the end, it was not only well-educated model democrats who arrived and could hardly wait to familiarize themselves with the European way of life. On Thursday, the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) sent Integration Minister Susanne Raab into the ring to explain what everyone knows anyway: the integration of so many people from other cultural backgrounds is an unprecedented feat. ""Austria has not yet overcome the consequences of 2015,"" Raab declared.The minister's press conference was disrupted by activists from Social Democratic youth organizations. ""Closing borders means shooting people"" was written on one of the banners they brought. SPÖ leader Pamela Rendi-Wagner would rather not sign that. In interviews, she steadfastly refused to answer the question whether she was in favor of taking women and children out of Greece. Instead, she repeatedly pleaded for ""local help. ""That's not enough for many ""The problem is still far away, at least geographically. Other EU countries are also debating whether and how to help the people in the shanty towns on the Greek islands. Nothing has been decided in Brussels so far, so there is no hurry in Austria either. Many contributions to the debate are mainly directed at the country's own supporters: The ÖVP is demonstrating toughness because it was elected to do so, the Greens are showing compassion because their voters like to see it. When asked whether he would prefer to be in the opposition now, in order to castigate the government's course from there, Michel Reimon has a clear answer: ""No, certainly not. It would be easier, of course, but we wouldn't be able to achieve anything at all there."" After all, he says, it was possible to raise the three million euros in emergency aid for Syria: ""That's not enough for many, but it's not nothing either. ""There is currently no reason to set the coalition mechanism in motion, according to the party. ""It would be different if there were thousands of refugees at the Austrian border,"" says a Green Party official.

452,154654350609872805652850839678632695640,"An Irish immunologist and molecular biologist points out the great danger of mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. Both vaccines have been licensed in the EU and Switzerland.Irish immunologist and molecular biologist Prof. Dr. Dolores Cahill at University College Dublin explains why mRNA vaccines are associated with extreme risks to humans in a video based on an animal study, ""Immunization with SARS coronavirus vaccines leads to pulmonary immunopathology on exposure to SARS virus,"" which was published in the journal Plos One.Minute 00:15 to 06:53 ""The vaccine mRNA goes into the body's own cells and produces the coronavirus spike protein there. In many cases, if people come into contact with natural coronaviruses a few months after vaccination, their immune systems could respond with a deadly cytokine storm. This is because SARS viruses replicate very rapidly. When a natural coronavirus circulates months after vaccination, it activates the immune system, which recognizes the self-produced spike proteins as a threat. The study of vaccinated mice with a 2012 gene vaccine showed that after 56 days when they were exposed to a SARS virus, they became very sick and some died. Experiences with infants who received an inactive RSV vaccine and were subsequently exposed to naturally occurring RSV (human respiratory syncytial virus) also showed the same problem. Most of these children developed severe illness with infection, resulting in a high number of hospitalizations - two of 35 children died from the infection. The conclusion from this experience was clear: RSV lung disease was exacerbated by prior vaccination. The immune system normally launches a major attack against the body's own cells two days after exposure to a natural virus. As a result, those vaccinated suffer septic shock with multiple organ failure, usually ending in death after about ten days. Another study conducted on U.S. Department of Defense personnel showed that influenza vaccination can increase the risk of other respiratory diseases.

However, when he spoke to other doctors, he did not violate the industry's code of conduct (Aluminum in Vaccines: Lack of Safety Studies on Ethical Grounds).Gates has three children with his wife Melinda - Jennifer, Rory and Phoebe - born between 1996 and 2002. According to his former doctor, they are all unvaccinated and healthy (Pediatrician confirms: Unvaccinated children are healthier than vaccinated and have better immune systems (videos)).The news that Bill Gates is not vaccinating his own children, despite being the most active vaccine campaigner in the world, should come as no surprise. Studies show that the elite are not vaccinating their children. At the same time, they expect the masses to vaccinate their children.In California, according to a recent study, the children most likely to be unvaccinated are white and come from the wealthiest families in Los Angeles.The percentage of kindergartners with state-issued personal belief exemptions doubled from 2007 to 2013, from 1.54% to 3.06%. That's about 17,000 of the wealthiest children, out of more than half a million, not receiving vaccinations (Revealed: Medical Sensation - Vaccinations ""Unnecessary"").According to CNN, vaccine percentages were highest in predominantly white, high-income neighborhoods like Orange County, Santa Barbara and parts of the Bay Area.The study, published in the American Journal of Public Heath, examined more than 6.200 California schools and found that exemptions for vaccines were twice as common as kindergartners who were in private institutions (university administered experimental vaccine to over a thousand babies, though monkeys died in tests after a short time).Trump wants to eliminate mandatory vaccinations in the U.S.U.S. President Donald Trump has been a thorn in the side of mandatory vaccinations in the U.S. since the beginning of his presidency. Long before Trump became a presidential candidate, he drew attention to the risks of vaccinations in young children.Trump followed the rising numbers of new autism cases in the US with concern as early as 2014. He himself had witnessed how a co-worker's healthy baby developed a very high fever a week after receiving several vaccinations and became autistic a short time later.Meanwhile, as U.S. president, Trump had asked Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Jan. 10, 2017, to chair the new government commission on vaccine safety and scientific integrity.In the mainstream media, however, Trump's attitude toward vaccinations is viewed very critically. The New York Times, for example, wrote that Trump's appointment opens the way for Kennedy's conspiracy theories about the dangers of vaccinations to enter the White House.Now Trump is laying the groundwork for the elimination of mandatory vaccinations in the United States. He created the Department of Conscience and Religious Liberty. For this department now gives various groups the legal basis to fight for their constitutional rights.People of all faiths now have the opportunity to stand up to the corrupt pharmaceutical industry. The mainstream in the U.S., however, is trying to cover this news. This is because pharmaceutical companies pay media outlets large sums of money for their advertising revenue.The new Department of Conscience and Religious Liberty allows certain faith communities to refuse vaccinations on religious or philosophical grounds. This is because the protection of freedom of religion and belief are just empty words on paper if they are not enforced.No one should be forced to act against their beliefs and faith. With this new department in the Trump administration, victims of discrimination by the health care system will regain justice, they argue.Bottom line:Very wealthy and privileged parents like the idea of herd immunity, but don't want to take the risk of vaccinations when it comes to their own children. They are concerned about side effects such as autism (Bill Gates: ""Vaccination is the best way to reduce population"" (video)).Literature:Vaccination: yes or no?The deceived patient: a doctor reveals why your life is at risk when you seek medical treatmentThe business of vaccinationsSources: PublicDomain/explainlife.com on Dec. 07, 2018.",Bill Gates former doctor says billionaire refused to vaccinate his children,Other

Various media outlets speculate that the attack could be a lesson from Israel to Lebanon because Iran supplies Hezbollah with weapons through that port. The Times of Israel wrote on Aug. 4:Last week, Israel said it had foiled an infiltration attempt by Hezbollah militants from Lebanon, triggering one of the heaviest exchanges of fire along the volatile border between Israel and Lebanon since a 2006 war between the bitter enemies.Netanyahu literally threatened, ""After the foiled attempt to plant explosives on the Golan border, Israeli enemies should know that we will do what it takes to defend ourselves.

The second explosion was caused by Israel's Delilah missile from an F16. That great heat was involved was reported by Western media.A Lebanese Army general said, according to Veterans Today, that Israel dropped a tactical nuclear weapon in the port of Beirut. He reported that this was done to cause the current political regime there to collapse and rebel against Hezbollah.A photo in the Veterans Today article shows the explosion and, above the smoke, a missile dimly visible. The caption reads, ""Israeli Delilah missile carrying 6 kiloton (6000 ton TNT equivalent) nuclear missile (unedited photo via VT Damascus).

It seems he has suddenly become an ""enemy of Israel"".When Trump confirmed that this was ""a bombing, not an accident"" he is immediately castigated by the pro-Israel press, starting with the Daily Beast.VT further writes: ""A Lebanese army general reports that Israel dropped a tactical nuclear weapon in the port of Beirut today. He says this was done to cause the current political regime there to collapse and rebel against Hezbollah.Their rejection, which is almost identical to Israel's, supports this hypothesis.Anything about this explosion, the mushroom cloud, or the strength of the blast would be a lie. It would be fireworks, that was the first lie, then ammonium nitrate fertilizer, 3,000 tons, stored for years to be used on the golf courses of Lebanon , if they decide to build them. (Note: but the ammonium nitrate could also have been the cover for the nuclear attack) No, nothing about today is funny.We also add that we believe that Netanyahu's statement, means that Israel acknowledges the attack. Beirut is still suffering from Israel's bombing since 2006. How one assesses Netanyahu's statements as set forth in Times of Israel today is a matter of faith, trust, or conjecture. As far as VT.Syria's President Assad orders all the country's borders and ports are open to Lebanon, orders caravans of ambulances to go to Beirut and ferries to hospitals in Damascus.

Be it the WHO's VigiBase, the VAERS in the U.S., or the Yellow Card system in the UK. One informant pointed out to us the numerous cases in the EMA database related to children from infancy onwards.No vaccine is licensed for infants, children or adolescents!Now it becomes very difficult to claim that all these cases have nothing to do with the vaccines. Moreover, the question arises as to whether each and every one of these cases should not be considered a crime.No vaccine is even remotely approved for children. By the way, study data such as that of the child vaccination study from Great Britain are explicitly not included in the EMA database.Politicians want to swear people to child vaccinationsAll these terrible cases are contrasted by statements such as those of Anthony Fauci, the U.S. ""Prof. Drosten,"" who wants to swear the public to child vaccinations from the beginning of 2022.

510,286676703240649818679310799360525053515,"The U.K. government has released a report detailing the adverse reactions to Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines that have occurred since they began rolling out on Dec. 8. The results are not pleasant reading.The report compiled data entered through the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme through Jan. 24, 2021. At that point, an estimated 5.4 million first doses of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and 1.5 million doses of Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine had been administered, and about 0.5 million second doses, mainly of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, had been administered.But as predicted, with the increase in vaccines administered came an increase in adverse reactions: 49,472 reported reactions to Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine and 21,032 reactions to Oxford/Astrazeneca's vaccine. For both vaccines, this means that 1 in 333 people experience an adverse reaction. This rate may actually be higher, as some cases may not have been reported to the Yellow Card Scheme.The Daily Expose looked at the government report (which you can find here) and took an in-depth look at reactions to the Pfizer vaccine.Thanks to the Pfizer vaccine, which uses MRNA technology to instruct human cells to ""perform a specific task,"" 5 people are now blind and vision has been affected in another 31. A total of 634 eye cases have been reported so far.There have also been 21 cerebrovascular accidents thanks to Pfizer's experimental vaccine. A cerebrovascular accident (stroke) is the sudden death of some brain cells due to lack of oxygen when blood flow to the brain is impaired due to blockage or rupture of an artery to the brain.We reported earlier on Dec. 4 how the U.K. government admitted that it does not know whether Pfizer's vaccine has an effect on fertility, which did little to convince anyone hoping to have children to get vaccinated. But that admission included comments on pregnancy that read:'Pregnancy'There are no or limited data on the use of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine BNT162b2.Reproductive toxicity studies in animals have not been completed. COVID-19 mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 is not recommended during pregnancy.Pregnancy should be excluded prior to vaccination in women of childbearing age. In addition, women of childbearing age should be advised to avoid pregnancy for at least 2 months after the second dose.So why on earth did we find a total of 4 spontaneous abortions within the Pfizer vaccine analysis print due to receiving a dose of Pfizer vaccine? The government's own recommendation is that any pregnant or women planning to become pregnant within the next two months should avoid the Pfizer vaccine, so why are pregnant women receiving this vaccine? You won't hear anything about it in the mainstream media.Sadly, there have also been 2 reports of spontaneous miscarriages after administration of the Oxford / Astrazeneca vaccine.Then we stumbled across an even more shocking statistic. The Yellow Card Scheme has received 59 reports of deaths and 7 reports of sudden death due to Pfizer's vaccine. That's 7 people who dropped dead immediately after vaccination.But the total number of ""Fatal Outcome"" reports due to Pfizer's vaccine, also known as ""deaths,"" is already 107 since January 24. So that's 5 people who are now blind, 21 who have suffered strokes, 4 who have suffered miscarriages, even though the government advises in fine print that pregnant women should avoid the ""vaccine,"" and 107 who have unfortunately died, all as a result of an experimental, emergency-approved vaccine for which the manufacturers have absolutely no responsibility when it comes to being held accountable or compensating for any side effects.We can also tell you that as of January 24, 2021, the Yellow Card Scheme has received 69 reports of Bell's Palsy (facial paralysis) due to Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine. Bell's Palsy is a condition that causes weakness or paralysis of the muscles in one side of the face. It is the most common cause of facial paralysis.The government, of course, has tried to explain away all these terrible side effects of the Covid vaccines. The report states:A high proportion of people vaccinated in the previous vaccination campaign are very old, and many of them also had pre-existing medical conditions. Older age and underlying chronic diseases make it more likely that incidental adverse events will occur, especially given the millions who have been vaccinated. It is therefore important that we carefully examine these reports to distinguish possible adverse events from illnesses that would have also occurred regardless of vaccination.That, dear readers, is the testimony of a ""hypocrite."" Tens of thousands of people have died with underlying illnesses within 28 days of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, yet their deaths have been labeled ""definitely covid"" and included in the covid death statistics (don't believe it? Then check out the in-depth analysis of ONS and NHS data). But of course we may only use this method of counting deaths when it comes to Covid. Because when it comes to the vaccine, we are told that they probably died from their ""underlying conditions,"" meaning that we should take all reports of deaths with a ""pinch of salt. ""The problem with this is that this method of calculation has resulted in the British people living under dictatorial tyranny for almost a year now.These are just the immediate side effects of the Covid vaccines, and only the ones that have been reported.

524,253330380540742867844998983907651742930,"The Israeli People Committee (IPC), a citizen-led group of Israeli health experts, has issued an urgent warning that Pfizer's Wuhan coronavirus ""vaccine"" (Covid-19) damages virtually every system in the human body.While attention, at least in Europe, has focused on AstraZeneca's vaccine, which has been linked to deadly blood clots, Pfizer's injection is actually much more dangerous and poses a much greater threat, according to recent data.A detailed report by the IPC warns that vaccination with a Pfizer shot can lead to catastrophic health consequences, as evidenced by the high number of people who have already lost their lives to such a shot in Israel. ""There has never been a vaccine that has harmed so many people,"" the report states. ""We received 288 reports of deaths near the time of vaccination (90% up to 10 days after vaccination), 64% of which were men. ""The Israeli Ministry of Health, on the other hand, claims that only 45 people in Israel have died from the Pfizer shot. This is a gross underestimate that downplays the true deadly effects of vaccination.If the numbers contained in the IPC report are correct, then more Israelis have died from the Pfizer shot than Europeans have died from the AstraZeneca shot across Europe.""According to data from the Central Bureau of Statistics, there was a 22% increase in overall mortality in Israel in January-February 2021, the peak of the Israeli mass vaccination campaign, compared to the previous year,"" the report continues. ""In fact, January and February 2021 were the deadliest months of the last decade, with the highest overall mortality rates compared to the corresponding months of the last 10 years.""Younger people are most likely to die from the Pfizer maceYounger people aged 20 to 29 appear to be the most affected, with the highest increase in mortality rates following the introduction of the Pfizer vaccine. ""In this age group, we find a 32% increase in all-cause mortality compared to the previous year,"" the report states.""Statistical analysis of information from the Central Bureau of Statistics combined with data from the Ministry of Health leads to the conclusion that the mortality rate among those vaccinated is estimated at about 1:5000 (1:13000 aged 20-49, 1:6000 aged 50-69, 1:1600 aged 70+).Based on this data, the IPC estimates that up to 1,100 Israelis have died from the Pfizer shot so far. Older people die the fastest, typically less than three days after injection, while younger people typically live more than a week after injection before dying.The IPC also found that the risk of death increases parabolically after the second injection. Those who stop with the first injection have a much greater chance of surviving than those who give themselves the second injection.As for injuries caused by the injections, the IPC found that cardiac events such as myositis and pericarditis are common. The same is true for massive vaginal bleeding, neurologic damage, and damage to the skeletal and skin systems. ""It should be noted that a substantial number of adverse event reports are directly or indirectly related to hypercoagulability (infarction), myocardial infarction, stroke, miscarriage, impaired limb perfusion, and pulmonary embolism,"" the group says.""These mRNA vaccines contain a virus that attaches to the RNA (messenger) of human DNA and cannot be reversed,"" warned a commenter at Great Game India.

528,18754657341761315226526442995376411187,"After almost 5 weeks of waiting, the 11th safety report of the PEI has been published. It deals with foreseeable vaccination side effects in people in the number of a major German city and the constant ignoring of all warning signals.10.06.2021 has now been published after more than four weeks of waiting the 11th safety report of the Federal Institute for Vaccines and Biomedical Products (Paul Ehrlich Institute, PEI). It contains data up to 31.05.2021 - so the PEI needed a whole 10 days to compile this report.The report is about thrombolic events distributed over all vaccines. In addition, 859 hemorrhages distributed over all organ systems, which are only mentioned in this report. Also, for the first time, myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the pericardium) are mentioned in a separate section. Guillain-Barré syndrome also plays an important role in this report.The number of expected vaccine side effects corresponds to all the inhabitants of a city like Aachen, Mainz or Kiel! However, due to the number of unreported cases, the realistic number will be significantly higher. General data on vaccinationThe following table shows the vaccinated doses of the different vaccine manufacturers in the reporting period:79,106 cases of vaccination side effects - 8,134 of them seriousBy May 31, 2021, 79,106 cases of vaccination side effects were reported to the PEI - 8,134 of them were classified as serious. Serious here means a reaction that requires the affected person to be hospitalized or that has been classified as medically ""significant"" - whoever determines what ""significant"" is. The distribution of cases of vaccine side effects among vaccines is as follows:AstraZeneca's vector vaccine clearly ""leads"" the reporting rate of vaccine side effects - for every 1,000 people vaccinated, 3.8 officially reported a vaccine side effect and 0.4 people even reported a severe one.The numbers don't sound alarming to the layperson at first. What are an average of 1.6 vaccination side effects per 1,000 vaccinated persons? Is the whole thing really that bad, or is the Corona Blog simply overdramatizing?Well, if you factor out the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in the reporting rate, you also get a reporting rate of 1.6 or 0.2 (serious) cases per 1,000 vaccine doses. In 2019, there were 71,018,629 people living in Germany who were 16 years of age or older. All of these would have to be vaccinated according to the logic of the federal government - and with 2 vaccine doses (which is why we factored out Johnson & Johnson). In total, the following number of people would then have to expect a vaccination side effect:This corresponds to all inhabitants of a city like Aachen, Mainz or Kiel! And this although in the statistics of the PEI ""not all cases are reported in the context of the spontaneous recording (dark figure rate)"". The following number of people would have to reckon with even a serious side effect of the vaccination: Still a very large number of people who have to reckon with permanent damage caused by the vaccination. If you put the whole thing in relation to the not quite 90,000 people who died ""of or with Corona"" in 1.5 years of the pandemic, who were on average 82 years old. Here one must seriously ask oneself whether these victims are worth the doubtful benefit of the vaccination?It is likewise interesting that the PEI does not call the average age of the persons, with whom vaccination side effects occur. It only remains to assume that these occur more frequently in the group for which Corona does not pose a major threat anyway.873 deaths - vaccination deaths occur earlier than Corona deathsBy May 31, 2021, 873 people had officially died in connection with the vaccination. Interesting here is that the average age of the deaths is only 77 years, which is below the average life expectancy in Germany and below the average age of the so-called ""corona deaths"", which is 82 years.Once again, the question arises: Are we literally casting out the devil with the Belzebub here?In contrast to the cases of vaccination side effects, the PEI gives a rough classification of deaths into age groups: Officially, 367 people under the age of 80 died in connection with the vaccination - well below the average life expectancy in Germany. When will candles be lit in the windows for these people?Adverse events of special interestThe PEI goes into more detail about selected events of special interest - which is what we want to do here.1,664 Thrombotic events - TTS increased in younger peopleIn the last PEI report, we mentioned that the vaccinations trigger a disease, the combination of which the PEI has named ""Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS)"". TTS is characterized by venous or arterial thrombosis (blood clots) in combination with thrombocytopenia (lack of platelets, which can lead to ""spontaneous"" bleeding throughout the body).As of May 31, 2021, a total of 1,664 ""thrombolic events"" have been reported to PEI. These are again highlighted in more detail depending on the vaccine.AstraZenecaAstraZeneca reported 860 thrombolic events. 106 cases were diagnosed with TTS syndrome, meaning it was a particularly severe thrombolic event. The PEI breaks down the TTS cases here again in more detail:It is striking here that the cases of TTS occur again increasingly in younger people (and are fatal), although the vaccination prioritization has only recently been lifted and to date the mass of vaccinated people is rather to be assumed in the upper age range. We are always surprised how the age of the affected person can be missing in a report to the PEI, especially if the person has died as a result of the vaccination. But this is also found in almost all safety reports so far.Regarding the official 21 deaths as a result of TTS at AstraZeneca, it is soberly noted: The frequency of fatal courses in persons who developed cerebral vein / sinus vein thrombosis is with 28.3% higher than described in the literature (for unvaccinated persons) (3%).Or in other words: The persons vaccinated with AstraZeneca die almost ten times more often from cerebral vein thrombosis than unvaccinated persons. Also of interest is the following excerpt in the TTS section:    Two deaths in men aged 38 and 70 years who were found dead after the first vaccination and who were found to have sinus vein thrombosis and cerebral hemorrhage at autopsy were not included. A reliable determination of the platelet count is usually not possible post mortem. However, in both deaths, a causal relationship with vaccination is possible because of the plausible temporal relationship with vaccination and the absence of risk factors.We summarize: Two people die of sinus vein thrombosis after vaccination. They have the misfortune that their platelet count can no longer be determined because they are already dead and therefore do not appear in these statistics. If even the PEI writes that a ""causal relationship with vaccination is possible,"" then it should really be clear that vaccination is almost certainly the cause of death. Yet they do not show up in the TTS statistics.But even without these two cases, the reporting rate for TTS at AstraZeneca is shockingly high: 1.24 cases per 100,000 vaccinations. In other words, if all people 16 and older in Germany were vaccinated with AstraZeneca, 1,762 people would experience TTS (which is often fatal). But here, too, it must be noted that there is probably an immense number of unreported cases, as the PEI itself writes:    Taking into account Vaxzevria vaccine doses, the overall reporting rate is 1.24 cases of TTS per 100,000 initial Vaxzevria vaccinations. However, this reporting rate likely represents a significant underestimation of the risk, as not all cases of TTS are reported (the rate of unreported cases).    In addition, the time between vaccination, onset of first symptoms, hospitalization, reporting, and evaluation of the report by the Paul Ehrlich Institute is sometimes several weeks. For example, approximately 80% of TTS cases were vaccinated before April 11, 2021, a time when the number of doses vaccinated was much lower. If, for example, 11.04.2021 were considered the data-lock point (DLP), the reporting rate would be 2.1 per 100,000 Vaxzevria vaccine doses.In other words, because of the cumbersome, German reporting system, the reporting rate of 1.24 is probably significantly understated. Probably a rate of 2.1 per 100,000 population is much closer to the whole thing - this would then be accompanied by a number of TTS cases in the population of 2,983 (compared to 1,762 at a rate of 1.24). But what is a ""marginal"" difference of 1,221 cases for PEI?The following single case mentioned by PEI under AstraZeneca is also frightening: Noteworthy is another case of two-stage TTS. A man in his early 60s developed pulmonary artery embolism with thrombocytopenia 12 days after the first vaccination. Anticoagulation [measure against blood clotting] with rivaroxaban [drug against blood clotting] was initiated. In the meantime, the patient was discharged home. Because of persistent headache, sinus vein thrombosis was ruled out several times.    Approximately one month after vaccination, the man developed hemiplegia and severe headache. Rediagnosis revealed extensive thrombosis of the cerebral sinus veins despite anticoagulation. In the SMR analysis, the PEI even calculates that thrombocytopenia occurs more than 8 times more frequently with AstraZeneca than would be expected in the unvaccinated population:The only logical conclusion: to stop vaccination immediately, however, is categorically avoided by the ""experts"". This is also politically not wanted.BioNTech-PfizerAlso with the mRNA vaccine of BioNTech-Pfizer there were 735 thrombolic events, 36 cerebral vein thromboses. Curiously, the PEI does not provide a detailed age breakdown here as it did for AstraZeneca. It simply states that the average age of those affected was 70.9 years. Since so far seniors have been vaccinated with BioNTech-Pfizer with mass, we may therefore safely assume that the thrombolic events (based on the number of vaccinations) have occurred predominantly in young people.Ironically, however, it is precisely here that the report details an individual fate of an 84-year-old woman:    In one case, an 84-year-old woman suffered cerebral venous thrombosis and cerebral hemorrhage with a fatal outcome. [...] The woman had contracted COVID-19 after the first Comirnaty vaccination. Three days after the quarantine was lifted, she developed symptoms of sinus vein thrombosis. History included previous illnesses including traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage.ModernaDespite the relatively small number of doses vaccinated, 68 thrombolic events also occurred in Moderna. The average age of those affected was again probably lower than the average age of the vaccinated population, at only 63.9 years. Again, only very brief reference is made to the single case of an elderly senior citizen:    One case involved an 80-year-old woman with a known factor V Leiden mutation and a history of serious thromboembolic events.One may seriously wonder which physician would vaccinate an 80-year-old woman with such a history. Perhaps a ""mobile vaccination team"" that simply ""pokes"" everything in a chord without responding to people individually?859 Bleeding distributed over all organ systemsThis is the first PEI report in which completely unspecific mention is made of ""bleeding in different localizations after vaccination"". According to PEI, the bleeding can be ""light bleeding"" such as hematomas, nosebleeds, or bleeding gums, but can also mean organ bleeding, bleeding in the brain, bleeding in the urine, or disturbed menstrual bleeding. A brief example of such bleeding is described in the report:    In one case, there was coffee-ground-like vomiting before death, so gastrointestinal bleeding [into the stomach] must be assumed.Across all vaccines, the age and gender distribution of bleeding is as follows:In the report, PEI further breaks down the data by individual vaccine and arrives at the following reporting rates for bleeding: For AstraZeneca, the reporting rate is 76.2 bleeds per million vaccinated persons, for BioNTech-Pfizer 7.5 bleeds per million persons, and for Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine a rate of 10.4 bleeds per million persons.The higher reporting rate for AstraZeneca is not questioned; on the contrary, the PEI still tries to justify it:    In summary, the reporting rate of bleeding after vaccination with Vaxzevria appears to be higher than after the two mRNA vaccines. Perhaps the experts at the PEI should go directly to AstraZeneca, if a federal institute seriously tries to talk up this number and says the reporting rate ""only seems to be higher"", then all alarm bells should go off. The reporting rate is obviously higher than at BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna. So maybe the underreporting rate at AstraZeneca is lower than for the other vaccines - which would be rather positive, of course. None of the ""experts"" in this federal institute comes to the conclusion to stop the vaccinations immediately, at least with AstraZeneca, in order to protect human lives?myocarditis and pericarditis, 66 + 5 + 13 = 84 there are 8 missing cases. Why?the PEI goes also for the first time in an extra section on myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation) and pericarditis (pericardial inflammation). Myocarditis often manifests with chest pain, palpitations, arrhythmias and/or heart failure, according to PEI. A total of 92 cases of myocarditis or pericarditis have been reported to PEI.Introduction states:    In recent weeks, the Paul Ehrlich Institute has received increasing reports of suspected myocarditis or perimyocarditis in temporal association with the administration of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, particularly in adolescents and young adults. The reported cases occurred predominantly in male adolescents and young adults 16 years of age and older, consistent with other, international data.Sixty-six of the 92 reported cases occurred after administration of BioNTech-Pfizer's vaccine. Again, the PEI listed the age structure for this vaccine:Here it is striking that the increased number of cases occurs in young people - with mass young males. Since the PEI indicates the minimum age only in this table with 16, it is to be assumed even that the youngest victim was only 16 years old.In the 11th report the PEI inserted in principle the same deviation analysis as in the 10th report - all points of criticism of this report apply still one to one to the 11th safety report. Again dubious sources are used and no specific risks (e.g. age- or at least gender-specific) are given. The only new aspect is the analysis of myocarditis, which appears twice:Let's start with the inconsistencies here:    Quite formally, the indication of sources under the report (again) does not match the footnotes in the table Adding the total myocarditis cases gives 66 + 5 + 13 = 84. A full 8 cases are missing. Why?    Two SMR calculations were made, with seriously different reference incidences. In the first line the reference incidence is 13.9 and in the second 4.4. Alone these two different values in the literature, which deviate so seriously from each other, should make all alarm bells ring with the ""experts"" and one could ask the question: Are these values representative for all of Germany?    But let's look at the sources in detail. Since here the sources as mentioned do not fit to the literature data, we can only speculate, what is meant with what. One title of a myocarditis source citation is ""Incidence of three presentations of acute myocarditis in young men in military service"" and we assume it is the source belonging to line 1. The paper was published in 1999:It studied young Finnish men doing military service from 1977 - 1996 and recorded how many had myocarditis. The average age of the men was 20 years. This alone makes it clear that this study of young men who were also doing their military service, i.e. who were recruited and ""preselected"" by district military replacement offices, cannot possibly be representative of the vaccinated population in Germany. The PEI could have saved itself the trouble of making this comparison. It is also striking that the study gives an average incidence of 0.17 per 1,000 person-years for a myocardial infarction:This corresponds to an incidence of 17 per 100,000 person-years (which the PEI uses). How the PEI comes with this source on 13.9 is simply a mystery to us.One must really already almost say ironically one finds in the study the following illustration:In the flow text it is mentioned likewise that the soldiers were inoculated from 1977 - 1979 against the smallpox and it came afterwards likewise increased within 14 days after the inoculation to Myokarditen. These are marked in red in the graph and were ""factored out"" and not considered in the study. Nevertheless, nobody at the PEI could draw the conclusion to the current vaccination campaign...The second source on myocarditis is a Swedish study from 2007 with the title ""Cardiomyopathy, pericarditis and myocarditis in a population-based cohort of inpatients with coeliac disease"". What the title already suggests is confirmed by the short introduction to the paper: The aim here was to find out whether persons with the autoimmune disease ""celiac disease"" have an increased risk of myocarditis.The incidence of 4.4 per 100,000 person-years is the reference value based on the national register of the total population of Sweden from 2002:And once again one may ask why the PEI, which is subordinate to the Federal Ministry of Health, has to fall back on almost 20-year-old data from Sweden instead of simply evaluating German data?The only thing that remains to be said here is that the deviation analysis continued around myocardites is as disappointing as the one from the last report and cannot give a realistic overview of the risk for specific groups in Germany.The conclusion of the PEI in this section unfortunately also sounds more like a capitulation or closing one's eyes to conclusions that are politically not wanted:    [...] although it is noticeable with both mRNA vaccines that predominantly younger people are affected, who however presumably do not make up the largest vaccination group in percentage terms due to vaccination prioritization.    Regrettably, current age- and sex-stratified vaccination rates of practicing physicians are not currently available, so it is not possible to calculate whether the number of reported cases of (peri)myocarditis in younger age groups is higher than would be expected by statistical chance in their age group.    In addition, it must be taken into account that mild courses may go unrecognized and not all cases are reported during spontaneous recording (dark figure rate).Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute inflammation of the peripheral nervous system and nerve roots (polyradiculoneuritis) resulting in ascending paralysis. Unfortunately, there are also some anomalies in the figures on GBS in the current report. For example, the PEI first writes that a total of 26 cases of GBS (or variants thereof) were reported after vaccination with AstraZeneca. 11 cases were reported after vaccination with BioNTech-Pfizer and 2 cases with the Moderna vaccine.In the variance analysis, which appears elsewhere in the report, GBS is the only disease for which the ""Total"" line is missing, where one can read the total number of cases:In addition, it is noticeable that 4 cases were reported with Moderna - more than twice as many as stated in the text:Apart from the fact that the variance analysis for GBS is again not done specifically, it is of course again noticeable that the value is significantly increased with AstraZeneca: Almost three times as many cases of GBS occur within 14 days of vaccination as would be expected in the unvaccinated population. We have already drawn the only logical conclusion above in the case of bleeding and do not want to repeat it here.Other ""trivia ""In passing, the report then mentions an ""acute disseminated encephalomyelitis"" (ADEM) in a young, 29-year-old woman. ADEM is characterized by neuropsychological symptoms such as psychomotor slowing or impaired consciousness. Headache, neck stiffness, vomiting, severe depression, epileptic seizures, a paraplegic syndrome, incomplete or hemiplegia, speech disorders, ataxic gait disorders, and, most importantly, bilateral inflammation of the optic nerve with visual disturbances may also occur. The PEI writes about the ""individual case"" only: ""The Paul Ehrlich Institute received a report of a case of ADEM in a 29-year-old woman one day after vaccination with Vaxzevria. The available information does not allow an evaluation, since both data on the diagnosis and the course are missing.How good that it is not the task of this institute to procure exactly such information or to investigate such facts.Again, in our opinion, a very frightening safety report, which, like all others, has not yet made it into the headlines of the ""old media"". It shows that the vaccinations do not only consist of a small ""prick"", for which one rolls up the sleeves. The report once again shows that this ""prick"" can all too often end fatally. We are of course happy to receive objective criticism and further information. The original report is available on the website of the PEI or here as a copy:","11th PEI safety report: 79,106 cases of vaccine adverse events, bleeding, and lack of logical inference.",Other

Also a mortician has announced itself with reitschuster.de, which likewise of anomalies with death certificates reports. And immediately numerous of it sent along. It reacted thereby to a report over the not radiated interview statements of one of its colleagues, a Bestatters from Meissen. He had said: ""Not everywhere where Corona is written on the death certificate, Corona is also in it"". For example, he had spoken to nurses in old people's homes and learned that deceased people who had only been in contact with people who had tested positive for Corona, but who themselves had no Corona, were nevertheless included in the statistics for Corona deaths.The mortician, whose contact details are available, wrote a short letter with various excerpts from death certificates attached: ""I hope that the excerpts somewhat support the statements of the colleague from the crematorium."" To my reply asking for clarification, he replied, ""I work as a mortician and the death certificates, twice red and once blue, are issued in the home or nursing home.

That's why I'm amazed at the means used to get doctors to add 'covid positive' to the 'normal' causes of death, even though it has nothing at all to do with the death, but is still included in the statistics. Even more surprising is the fact that old people in nursing homes refuse food according to the death certificate, which is also officially concealed.The reason for this, according to the opinion of the bereaved, with whom I then conduct the mourning conversations, is the loneliness or isolation of the seniors in the homes. Today, thanks to you, it is possible to bring such news to the people. I try to take away the fear of the virus in the circle of acquaintances with this information, but it becomes more and more difficult. The months of influence leave many traces that scare me.

540,64639158026842180997979401962396570675,"This is shown by official figures from Great Britain and the WHO. The authorities still do not want to see any connection. By Christoph Pfluger ""The death is not related to the vaccination"" - as of today, such assurances can no longer be believed under any circumstances. In Great Britain, no less than 244 people out of almost ten million vaccinated people died shortly afterwards, including eight miscarriages (as of the end of January). The figure comes from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency of the British government and is official, so it is certainly not exaggerated.How many deaths would normally be expected after a flu vaccination? There is an official answer to this question as well: 5.75 per ten million people vaccinated. The figure also comes from the United Kingdom and can be found on page 77 of the ""Vaccine Safety Basics"" handbook published by the WHO in 2013.The mRNA vaccines thus cause around 40 times more deaths than would be expected from flu vaccinations. There are two possible explanations for the difference, or a combination of them: safety: the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Astra-Zeneca - which are the ones at issue - are far more dangerous than assumed.    Negligence: the vaccination campaigns are being carried out hastily and with neglect of basic precautions.On safety:Pfizer/Biontech's mRNA vaccine was tested on 20,000 people, with 20,000 more receiving a placebo. This small number of test subjects does not allow a reliable assessment of safety. Even a single death among 20,000 would statistically overstate the hazard by a factor of two. No death would mask any hazard.To approximate the probability of deaths after vaccination (5.75 per 10 million for influenza vaccination according to WHO), test groups larger by factors would be needed. With 500,000 study participants, the range of statistically plausible deaths (the so-called ""confidence interval"") is between 5 and 20 cases according to telephone information from a medical statistician, so it is still highly imprecise. Reliable statements about the probability of so-called ""rare events"" are absolutely impossible with the real test size of 20,000 vaccinated individuals. Statements that the vaccine is safe are therefore highly unscientific. Pfizer is obviously aware of these shortcomings, which is why the company has concluded a detailed contract with the Ministry of Health of the vaccine pioneer Israel for the evaluation of the data (here, unfortunately, only a version with numerous blackened pages that was leaked to us). Pikant: The results of the study are confidential, the publication of the data takes place together. Pfizer can thus control the results.The poor quality of Pfizer's tests is also underscored by the fact that only about 8 percent of the 3580 illnesses that arose after the test vaccinations were included in the evaluation, namely only those that were simultaneously associated with a positive PCR test.Of these 170 confirmed Covid 19 illnesses, 162 were in unvaccinated persons and eight in vaccinated persons. This resulted in the globally published efficacy of over 90 percent.The remaining 3410 illnesses were excluded from the evaluation because they were not confirmed Covid-19 cases, but ""suspected Covid-19,"" presumptively Covid-19. (Details of this monstrosity in the FDA's report on the Pfizer/Biontech vaccine)Among the vaccinated, 1594 contracted ""suspected Covid-19,"" and 1810 in the placebo group, a ratio of 47 to 53 percent - an insignificant advantage for the vaccinated. (Read more by pharmacology professor Peter Doshi in the British Medical Journal)A major drawback of the Pfizer test is also the fact that older people in particular were excluded from the study, according to a scientific paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association.    ""Older adults have the greatest risk of severe illness and death from coronavirus disease,"" it says. ""Worldwide, individuals older than 65 years make up 9 percent of the population, but account for 30 to 40 percent of cases and more than 80 percent of deaths. ""According to Ugur Sahin of Biontech, the developer of Pfizer's mRNA vaccine, enough elders participated in the study that he is confident ""this vaccine appears to work in the higher-risk population."" (source)But apparently, of all people, none of those over 80 participated in the study, who are now most affected by the deaths. Pharmaceutical companies have a well-known tendency to test the healthiest people possible in order to quickly arrive at positive results.It is inexplicable that such statistical ambiguities, not to say manipulations, get through to the regulatory authorities without informing the public, especially since Swissmedic did not approve Pfizer's vaccine in an accelerated procedure, but allegedly in the ""ordinary procedure,"" as it emphasized in a media release.On the negligence:Vaccination campaigns worldwide focus on older people, since they are particularly at risk. That's true, their risk of disease is higher. But the tests did not include people over 80 and those with pre-existing conditions. So we don't know how well the vaccine will work in these groups. Nevertheless, the vaccine is mainly given to them. In addition, the elderly are known to respond less well to the flu vaccine on average, a contraindication.The clustered cases of corona outbreaks following vaccination in nursing homes are still anecdotal. But while PCR tests, ""cases,"" hospitalizations, and deaths are meticulously recorded and published daily, there is still little reliable information about waves of infections and deaths following vaccination in nursing homes. In the case of deaths, health authorities worldwide use the same language to declare that a connection with vaccination is highly unlikely. The first death after vaccination in Switzerland died of his illnesses, Swissmedic announced hours after the case became known. If he was sick - which his doctor denied - why was he vaccinated? If he was healthy, what did he die of? Acute illnesses are a clear contraindication.Vaccination campaigns are apparently often carried out quite militarily. Instead of clear information and conscious consent, the authorities rely on tight organization and symbols of authority. In a Berlin nursing home with several deaths, soldiers in camouflage suits were present during the vaccination, which, according to eyewitness reports, intimidated the elderly people with war experience. This is not exactly an approach one would expect with a vaccine that is about 40 times more dangerous than a flu shot. Caution is called for and clear communication of the risks, as is done with other drugs.The vaccination campaign is taking place in a climate of fear and lack of information, in which the media play a crucial role. Critical voices are not only suppressed, but actively combated. A preliminary low point was provided by the Rundschau journalist Thomas Vogel, who concludes his article ""Doctors in their sights: Authorities against corona skeptics"" of February 10 with the call: ""The state must decide how much freedom it should grant corona-skeptical doctors. It is no coincidence that Andreas Heisler, MD, of all people, is being targeted by SRF television. He is not only the founder of the critical doctors' network ""Aletheia"". He also publicized the fact that Switzerland's first vaccine fatality - a former patient of his - had a known intolerance to flu shots, but was vaccinated anyway (details here).This crucial fact was not only concealed by Swissmedic, which disseminated a different account hours after the fatality became known, but also by Thomas Vogel, who knew better. He had called me before the shooting and had the connections explained to him in detail, including references to the relevant sources. On SRF-News Vogel goes one step further: He claims untruthfully that Andreas Heisler doubts the existence of the virus. When asked about this, Heisler explains: ""I have explicitly said that I do not deny the existence of the corona virus, on the contrary, I have said that I myself must have been ill with corona, since I have documented a high antibody titer. But he wants and must ... push me into this corner, so that the sluggish authorities finally and decisively take action against me. ""The clear statement should actually still be in the unused archive material at SRF and be available for a possible trial. Until such a trial has taken place, one can only recommend SRF television as a source for finding out about the latest propagandistic activities.The weekly newspaper ""Zeit"" is a good example of how negligent, not to say deliberately misleading, even recognized media deal with the facts surrounding deaths after vaccinations. The title ""523,000 vaccinated, no Corona deaths"" is not factually incorrect, but deceptive. According to the evaluation of the Israeli health insurance company ""Maccabi"", none of its vaccinated members died of Covid-19. But the deaths in the immediate aftermath of the vaccination are simply suppressed. This is how science journalism works today.As a journalist, I wonder what this job title is still valid for today. In an SRF radio talk show last May, Maurice Thiriet, head of the news portal watson, claimed twice that I was not a journalist at all. It doesn't take much more, and I have to agree with him. If what passes for a journalist today is confirmed, I will have to find a new job title.ConclusionThe massively increased lethality of the mRNA vaccine compared to the flu vaccine is an extraordinary warning signal. It can be assumed that neither the media nor the authorities will report about it in an appropriate way - they would have to admit too many mistakes to still be considered credible.And it is questionable what the socially distanced and frightened person with his limited and censored means of communication can still do to warn others about the danger. For the presumably greater risks, the long-term side effects, are yet to come. They could then really lead to an overload of hospitals. It will do us little good to have known.Source:Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency: Coronavirus vaccine - weekly summary of Yellow Card reporting - February 11, 2021WHO: Vaccine Safety Basics, 2013.",The scandal now has a sure number: mRNA vaccines are 40 times more dangerous than flu shots,Other

This has nothing at all to do with the vaccination, assures us the state radio. So that now the defense with physicians and care personnel, in addition, altogether in Germany does not rise still more, now again the state broadcasting station sees the time come to carry out its educational order in the institution of the cared for thinking. In the first place the ""Tagesschau"", which lets know that ""scientists give the all-clear, since there are no indications that it comes to increased deaths in connection with the inoculation."" ""For laymen too complicated ""As vaguely, as this statement remains, the ARD magazine ""Panorama"" shoots again after: According to ""research"" there is ""but not a single proven case in which the vaccination led to death. ""More precise reasons, however, will not be provided. Because: ""For laymen, the 19-page document is difficult to comprehend. The high mortality rate is simply due to the fact that so many old people are vaccinated who would have died anyway: ""If you vaccinate a group of people who have a statistically high risk of dying in the near future anyway, then it is of course also possible that someone dies in close temporal connection with the vaccination. - so all seriousness Thomas Mertens, virologist and chairman of the constant inoculation commission (STIKO). Those were so old, which would have died anyway ""As example then the death of a 91-j?hrigen woman is valid in the Hessian Wetzlar. The senior citizen was initially stable after the vaccination. But after she was taken to her room in a nursing home, her condition deteriorated rapidly. The emergency doctor was unable to save the woman. You really have to ask yourself: how stupid do these scientists and the media think people are? What was not allowed to apply to those who died ""with or from"" Corona (old age, previous illnesses), must now be used as a reason for the exorbitantly high number of deaths after vaccination.Update 12.02.21: 800 Styrian hospital employees refuse vaccinationThe tragic side effects and the lack of the promised positive effects of the ""vaccination"" have already led to extensive refusals by nursing staff to be vaccinated. For example, in our neighboring country Austria: ""800 Styrian hospital employees refuse AstraZeneca vaccination"".Read also our PP report:",Germany: 113 people already dead after Covid vaccination,Other

Meanwhile, mainstream media also see the problem. Especially in the creative and self-employed scene, the number of cases is rising - hushed up by politicians.Nobody knows exactly how many people the crisis has driven to suicide. But the numbers must be out of all proportion. Morticians, funeral orators and pastors report exploding numbers of cases. Only occasionally do unconfirmed reports emerge that during the first lockdown in Berlin alone, suicide figures were observed that were more than ten times above the normal average for the period under review. When in the summer AfD members of the Bundestag addressed a small question to the Ministry of Health as to whether the government had the development of suicide rates in the Corona crisis on the screen and was following it, they received the disturbing answer that such surveys were not carried out, one had to rely on the regular figures of the Federal Statistical Office, which would not be published until 2021 for the past year. As if 2020 had been a year like any other. How is such a thing possible? Hundreds of billions of euros are sunk, but no resources are put in hand let alone is the need seen to monitor the possibly most obvious and immediate effects of unprecedented impositions and restrictions on life and liberty of citizens?A quiet dyingIn the ""Welt"", author and film director Tom Bohn described the shocking plight of many artists and cultural workers, who have been deprived of their livelihood for almost a year, who are starving at the outstretched hand of marginal state aid and, above all, are going mentally and socially to the dogs. Particularly in the case of stage and film actors, small artists and musicians, who often have a sensitive and sensitive mind, the consequences of isolation, public deprivation and thus the feeling of one's own superfluousness due to ""not being needed"" are psychologically serious.Bohn reports of suicides by the dozen from a milieu that represents the intellectual backbone of this country and which is being deprived of the air to breathe. He writes of the ""quiet death"" through suicides of artists he knows: ""The numbers of artists and creative people who have become unemployed, however, are nowhere to be found. And also not the number of desperate acts. In my circle of acquaintances, there are now five colleagues who have recently considered suicide. And have talked about it openly. Five! One actor I know personally has been sitting in his Berlin apartment for two months, no longer going out on the street or answering the phone. Empty pizza boxes are piled up in his living room. His agency initially took care of him. Now only his daughter does.And he draws a conclusion in question form that Corona politics should definitely take to heart: Will the death toll get smaller if you're willing to walk over dead bodies to get it?

556,324897458105085510604238205575479586305,"A new study by the U.S. CDC raises the suspicion that ubiquitous masking does nothing. On the contrary. More than 80 percent of respondents with corona symptoms in the study reported wearing their face flap all the time or pretty much all the time.Universal worldwide masking could not only be stunning in the truest sense of the word for the wearer, but apparently even increase likelihood of developing corona symptoms. Back in September, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the previously completely unnoticed study that surveyed COVID-19 patients with symptoms of the disease.70.6% of respondents said they ""always"" wear a mask, while another 14.4% said they ""often"" wear a mask. This means that a whopping 85% of infected COVID-19 patients had voluntarily made it difficult for themselves to breathe with the supposedly indispensable ""corona protective mask"" and still became infected. 3.9% of those with the disease reported ""never"" wearing face coverings.It can also be concluded that tens of thousands of Americans become infected with COVID-19 every day despite having face flaps. Masks do not work; they are not a means to slow or stop the spread. The study also rejects claims by ""corona experts"" such as U.S. immunologist Dr. Anthony Fauci and others that Americans are not following guidelines disseminated by the CDC and other disease control agencies.In the screenshot above, the left column shows people with symptoms in the right column shows the control group. According to The mass illusion, the study provides no evidence that COVID-19 infection protection is associated with mask wearing. In fact, given the lack of separation between the symptomatic group and the control group, it provides evidence that masks do absolutely nothing to stop the spread of COVID-19. The study directly contradicts claims made by CDC Director Robert Redfield in September.The study comes to the unsurprising conclusion that people who go out more increase their risk of contracting COVID-19 (or another contagious disease). Clearly, the safest way to protect yourself from a virus with a 99.8% recovery rate is to never interact with anyone again, but that is absurd as a long-term life plan.The vast majority of novel coronavirus transmissions occur at home. There is no evidence anywhere in the world that masks are associated with slowing or stopping COVID-19 transmission. Furthermore, there is ample evidence that the wearing of universal masks or mask mandates have innumerable negative effects on society.15 years ago, the Technical University of Munich concluded after a study that CO2 can only partially escape when exhaled through the surgical mask. ""This effect led to the result that the test subjects inhaled air whose CO2 content was higher than that of the surrounding room air."" This would increase the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood. this information is currently considered a false claim, according to the Robert Koch Institute. ""That one inhales more CO2, is not true, that the respiration is hindered, already"", so a spokeswoman of the RKI. At least one admits there just still that with the long wearing of damp masks to a contamination of the mouth pharyngeal flora with bacteria can come. The reality proves - in spite of world-wide mask mania - by ever higher test numbers ever more humans are tested positively for the Coronavirus. So wearing a mask does not protect.

566,129762407902770168372226485690638096220,"Five weeks after the start of vaccinations, it is still not clear what the ""protective"" effect of the much-vaunted mRNA vaccines actually is. There are no reliable data on whether vaccinated persons can subsequently pass on the virus, nor is it completely unclear how long immunity lasts. Also, repeated infections of the vaccinated cannot be ruled out. However, the main effect of the vaccination is supposed to be that there are at least no more severe covid cases. For weeks now, there has been an increase in the number of cases in which vaccinated persons have fallen ill with corona shortly after receiving the first dose (Wochenblick reported). Many of them quite severe and with symptoms that at least do not show any difference to a normal Corona infection. This alone raises the question of why one should actually be vaccinated, if the vaccination carries as great a risk of covid disease as the virus itself.Vaccines can lead to more severe coursesBut it gets even better (or worse): For nearly three months, officials have known that the mRNA corona vaccines can lead to more severe courses of covid than would be expected without vaccination. This means, therefore, that they have the exact opposite effect of their intended use. This explains not only the phenomenon that some patients only developed covid after being vaccinated. But if a possibly unnoticed Corona-positive person is vaccinated, a Covid outbreak with a severe course could only occur as a result of the vaccination.Risk known since OctoberIn a study published in the International Journal of Clinical Practice at the end of October, this risk was explicitly investigated and confirmed, i.e. at a time when the Pfizer/Biontech vaccine had just completed its third clinical test phase and entered the approval process. The authors of the study write that this is not a merely theoretical effect, but cite ""overwhelming"" evidence. They also call for patients to be made aware of this possibility before receiving the vaccine. But this is exactly what is not happening at all. Neither in the media and political vaccination propaganda, nor by the vaccinating medical personnel themselves. It is therefore high time that people are openly informed about the risks of the mRNA vaccine, which is praised as a panacea. And with the same zeal with which they have been forcibly educated for months about the ""terrible, deadly epidemic"" Corona. (DM)",Study confirms: More severe covid courses due to vaccination.,Other

The UKSH has thus received subsidies for 166 reserve beds created, although these beds never existed in real terms.Emergency reserve instead of operational beds and yet the UKSH receives 11.7 million euros of taxpayers' moneyToday we would like to take a closer look at the younger brother of our new Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD). Prof. Dr. Jens Scholz is the brother of Olaf, who became C4 Professor of Anesthesiology and Director of the Clinic for Anesthesiology and Operative Intensive Care Medicine at the UKSH, Kiel Campus, in 2000.

He has been a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina since 2006, where people such as Lothar Wieler and Joachim Sauer (Angela Merkel's husband) are also members. As many know by now, in 2020 there was a lot of money from health insurance companies for new intensive care beds. Some hospitals built up astonishing capacities in the process. But many beds were in storage, according to research by WDR, NDR and SZ. The Tagesschau further writes: ""Whoever you ask among the top 10 payees, everywhere you hear that the majority of the newly financed intensive care beds were not immediately ready for operation, but were understood as reserves.
